0,0,"Knowledge graph completion models can be improved by utilizing pre-trained language models to effectively connect new entities to existing knowledge graphs, achieving significant performance improvements through the use of masked language model classification and multi-task learning methods.",2810,"Knowledge graph extension with a pre-trained language model via unified learning method Knowledge graph completion; Open-world knowledge graph completion; Pre-trained language model; Entity representation learning; Multi-task learning Knowledge graphs (KGs) are collections of real-world knowledge that is represented by a structured form of triples. Since they are manually built in their nascent stage, there is a common problem that some links (triples) are missing. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to find those missing links and thereby complete the KGs. However, as knowledge increases through diverse sources, new entities have explosively emerged and they are needed to be connected to existing KGs. Thus, open-world KGC is targeted on extending KGs to those new entities. Dealing with those new entities is challenging because they do not have any connection with entities in the existing KGs. One way to handle the new ones is to embed them with their textual descriptions with pre-trained word embeddings and score them in the graph-vector space with the existing typical KGC models. These models have resulted in meaningful results but there is still a lack of studies on utilizing the latest neural networks, such as pre-trained language models which are known to be better at capturing contexts than pre-trained word embeddings. This paper proposes a novel model that effectively connects new entities and existing KGs through a pre-trained language model. To effectively handle the problem, we utilize two learning methods; one is the classification method of the masked language model (MLM) that predicts a word among a huge vocabulary set with a given context, and the other is multi-task learning based on the Multi-Task for Deep Neural Networks (MT-DNN). Based on the methods, the model first generates an embedding of a new entity using its textual description and then uses the embedding to find one of the existing entities from a KG where the new entity can be connected. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets, DBPedia50k, FB15k-237-OWE, and FB20k, show that the proposed model improves performances by 9.2%p, 4.4%p, and 11.1%p, respectively, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance for all datasets.

1,0,Deep learning techniques have surpassed traditional machine learning methods in entity linking applications by achieving state-of-the-art performance.,3958,"Entity Linking Meets Deep Learning: Techniques and Solutions Task analysis; Taxonomy; Deep learning; Knowledge based systems; Feature extraction; Data mining; Coherence; Entity linking; deep learning; entity disambiguation; knowledge base Entity linking (EL) is the process of linking entity mentions appearing in web text with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. EL plays an important role in the fields of knowledge engineering and data mining, underlying a variety of downstream applications such as knowledge base population, content analysis, relation extraction, and question answering. In recent years, deep learning (DL), which has achieved tremendous success in various domains, has also been leveraged in EL methods to surpass traditional machine learning based methods and yield the state-of-the-art performance. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis of existing DL based EL methods. First of all, we propose a new taxonomy, which organizes existing DL based EL methods using three axes: embedding, feature, and algorithm. Then we systematically survey the representative EL methods along the three axes of the taxonomy. Later, we introduce ten commonly used EL data sets and give a quantitative performance analysis of DL based EL methods over these data sets. Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of existing methods and highlight some promising future directions."
2,0,"A new machine learning framework is developed to support low-cost, high-performance embedded devices for real-time distributed machine learning algorithms.",210,"Design and Evaluation of a New Machine Learning Framework for IoT and Embedded Devices supervised learning; unsupervised learning; semi-supervised learning; reinforcement learning; classifiers; decision trees; boosting; data wrangling; smart objects; embedded IoT platforms Low-cost, high-performance embedded devices are proliferating and a plethora of new platforms are available on the market. Some of them either have embedded GPUs or the possibility to be connected to external Machine Learning (ML) algorithm hardware accelerators. These enhanced hardware features enable new applications in which AI-powered smart objects can effectively and pervasively run in real-time distributed ML algorithms, shifting part of the raw data analysis and processing from cloud or edge to the device itself. In such context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be considered as the backbone of the next generation of Internet of the Things (IoT) devices, which will no longer merely be data collectors and forwarders, but really smart devices with built-in data wrangling and data analysis features that leverage lightweight machine learning algorithms to make autonomous decisions on the field. This work thoroughly reviews and analyses the most popular ML algorithms, with particular emphasis on those that are more suitable to run on resource-constrained embedded devices. In addition, several machine learning algorithms have been built on top of a custom multi-dimensional array library. The designed framework has been evaluated and its performance stressed on Raspberry Pi III- and IV-embedded computers."

Furthermore, we give a necessary and sufficient condition whether the associated graded Lie algebra gr(M-3) of M-3 is naturally embedded into the Johnson Lie algebra L(IA(F-3)) of the IA-automorphisms of F-3."
4,1,A semitopological group G admits a homeomorphic embedding as a subgroup of a product of metrizable semitopological groups if and only if G is topologically isomorphic to a subgroup of a product of first-countable paracompact regular σ-spaces or Moore semitopological groups.,2765,"On some kinds of ω-balancedness and (*) properties in certain semitopological groups Completely omega; balanced Strongly metrizable space q; point Semitopological group M; omega; balancedness MM; balancedness In this article, we discuss some relationships of w -balancedness and ( * ) properties which were introduced for giving characterizations of subgroups of topological products of certain para(semi)topological groups. We mainly get the following results. If G is a regular w -balanced locally w -good semitopological group with a q -point, then Ir ( G ) <= w if and only if Sm ( G ) <= w . If G is a regular strongly paracompact semitopological group with a q -point and Sm ( G ) <= w , then G is completely w - balanced if and only if G has property ( & lowast; ). If G is a regular paracompact w -balanced locally good semitopological group with a q -point and Sm ( G ) <= w , then G has property ( w * ) if and only if G has property (**). If G is a regular metacompact semitopological group with a q -point and Sm ( G ) <= w , then G is MM - w -balanced if and only if G is M - w -balanced. We show that a semitopological group G admits a homeomorphic embedding as a subgroup of a product of metrizable semitopological groups if and only if G is topologically isomorphic to a subgroup of a product of semitopological groups which are first-countable paracompact regular sigma -spaces and is topologically isomorphic to a subgroup of a product of Moore semitopological groups.
