0,0,The use of agent transparency in human-AI collaboration systems can increase trust and improve task outcomes by reducing information asymmetry between humans and AI systems.,78,"Designing Transparency for Effective Human-AI Collaboration nan The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing quickly, and systems can increasingly perform a multitude of tasks that previously required human intelligence. Information systems can facilitate collaboration between humans and AI systems such that their individual capabilities complement each other. However, there is a lack of consolidated design guidelines for information systems facilitating the collaboration between humans and AI systems. This work examines how agent transparency affects trust and task outcomes in the context of human-AI collaboration. Drawing on the 3-Gap framework, we study agent transparency as a means to reduce the information asymmetry between humans and the AI. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we formulate testable propositions, derive design requirements, and synthesize design principles. We instantiate two design principles as design features of an information system utilized in the hospitality industry. Further, we conduct two case studies to evaluate the effects of agent transparency: We find that trust increases when the AI system provides information on its reasoning, while trust decreases when the AI system provides information on sources of uncertainty. Additionally, we observe that agent transparency improves task outcomes as it enhances the accuracy of judgemental forecast adjustments."
1,0,A methodology for developing human-AI collaborative decision support systems is needed to integrate AI-agents into collaborative processes while addressing key challenges such as human-AI interaction and interpretability.,38,"Towards a Methodology for Developing Human-AI Collaborative Decision Support Systems nan Decision-making is a complex activity, often demanding collaboration, sometimes even in the form of dynamic (ad hoc) teams of loosely coupled participants collected to deal with a particular problem. At the same time, recent developments in the AI have shown that AI plays an important role in decision-making, and AI-agents may become full-fledged participants of collaborative decision support systems. However, integration of AI-agents into collaborative processes requires solving a number of tasks concerning human-AI interaction, interpretability, mutual learning, etc. This paper is a step towards a methodology to create decision support systems based on human-AI collaboration. An analysis of typical requirements to the collaborative decision support systems and typical scenarios that such systems have to implement sustains the introduced methodology. Based on this analysis, foundational problems needed settlements to develop human-AI collaborative decision support systems have been identified, and their possible solutions are offered. In the proposed methodology, ontologies play an important role, providing interoperability among heterogeneous participants. The methodology implies a technological backing in the form of a collaborative computational environment, helping to develop decision support systems for particular domains."
2,0,"A solution framework (Human-AI Collaboration) enables model-driven development of human-AI teaming systems through graphical user interface, promoting successful collaboration between humans and AI systems.",7,"HACO: A Framework for Developing Human-AI Teaming nan We witnessed great advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) powered technologies over the past few decades. Wide use of AI technologies has led to the creation of an ecosystem where human and AI systems are partners, complementing each other with their strengths. To build a successful human-AI team, there are several considerations, including context awareness, effective communication, pro-activeness, etc. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of human-AI teaming concepts. We extend a multi-agent framework, Java Agent Development Framework ( JADE), to support the proposed taxonomy. Our solution framework, Human-AI Collaboration (HACO), enables a model-driven development of human-AI teaming systems through graphical user interface. In this paper, we present the solution architecture for extending JADE with human-AI teaming taxonomy. A user study performed to assess the usefulness of HACO, shows that HACO is a promising framework. We evaluated the proposed framework by developing a set of use cases for a contact center and observed a signification reduction in the overall development effort."
3,1,"Agent learning can be improved by integrating adapting learning methods, including reinforcement learning, accommodation, and assimilation, to enhance convergence rate and learning quality in multi-agent systems.",1136,"Applying assimilation and accommodation for cooperative learning of RoboCup agent nan Adapting learning is the essential ability to improve the convergence rate and learning quality in the multi-agent system. This paper integrates three adapting learning methods to make agent learns efficiently. Reinforcement learning is used to compute strategies for multi-agent soccer teams. The accommodation technology attaches the new knowledge from external information. As a conflict between the external knowledge and agent's knowledge, we utilize the assimilation technology to adjust the agent's knowledge. Finally, our method compares with UvA team and be verified on the RoboCup simulator."
4,1,"A multi-agent reinforcement learning bidding approach (MARLBS) integrating reinforcement learning, bidding and genetic algorithms achieves superior game-playing performance in Backgammon with zero built-in knowledge.",1524,"A multi-agent system integrating reinforcement learning, bidding and genetic algorithms nan This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning bidding approach (MARLBS) for performing multi-agent reinforcement learning. MARLBS integrates reinforcement learning, bidding and genetic algorithms. The general idea of our multi-agent systems is as follows: There are a number of individual agents in a team, each agent of the team has two modules: Q module and CQ module. Each agent can select actions to be performed at each step, which are done by the Q module. While the CQ module determines at each step whether the agent should continue or relinquish control. Once an agent relinquishes its control, a new agent is selected by bidding algorithms. We applied GA-based MARLBS to the Backgammon game. The experimental results show MARLBS can achieve a superior level of performance in game-playing, outperforming PubEval, while the system uses zero built-in knowledge."

Contrary to AAAI robot competition, which is tuned for a single heavy-duty robot, RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. Although RoboCup's final target is a world cup with real robots, RoboCup offers a software platform for research on the software aspects of RoboCup. This paper describes technical challenges involved in RoboCup, rules and simulation environment."
7,2,Developing a hybrid distributed reinforcement learning algorithm for improving the performance of soccer teams in RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation System.,2667,"The Application of Hybrid Distributed Reinforcement Learning Algorithm in RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation System nan The RobuCup 2D Soccer Simulation has been used as the basis for successful international competitions and research challenges. When developing a soccer team for simulated soccer,one has to deal with the RoboCup soccer simulator. In this simulation system, it is the Multiagents' sensory perceptions and individual abilities which are received from the server, coupled with the cooperation strategies designed by researchers, that together determine whether the soccer team will win this game or not. In cooperation strategy designing, researchers often employ the method of Distributed Reinforcement Learning algorithms to optimize the simulation system. The paper is extended as follows: First, we will make a description of the characteristics about the RoboCup simulation system.

8,2,"A framework for high-level Setplay definition and execution is presented for RoboCup's 2D simulation league, providing a generic approach to structuring robotic soccer team behavior.",2264,"Co-ordination in RoboCup's 2D simulation league: Setplays as flexible, multi-robot plans nan Strategic planning and multi-agent coordination are major research topics in the domain of RoboCup. Research was, in the first years, directed towards development of low level skills and positional co-ordination. The competitive level has in between risen to new standards, which makes the development of highlevel co-operation necessary. The importance of the concept of Setplay, i.e., small multirobot plans to deal with particular situations, to structure a robotic soccer team behaviour, has been acknowledged by many researchers, but no general framework for the development and execution of generic Setplays has been introduced in the context of RoboCup. This paper presents such a framework for high-level Setplay definition and execution in the 2D simulation league, though applicable to any RoboCup co-operative league and similar domains. The framework is built upon a standard, flexible and league-independent language, which defines Setplays that are interpreted and executed at run-time, using inter-robot communication. A major step in the development of the Setplay framework is its usage and testing in the scope of the FCPortugal team, which participates in the RoboCup 2D-simulation league, where it won several titles. After this successful implementation, described in this paper, the framework will be used in the mid-size league, and possibly in other new environments. Recent developments have made it possible to use Setplays in play-on situations, which had not been possible before. Also, a graphical tool for Setplay definition has been developed, and used in the context of this team."
9,3,A decentralized cooperative control scheme with obstacle avoidance for a team of mobile robots enables autonomous formation control and adaptive obstacle avoidance through virtual and behavioral structures.,3070,"A Decentralized Cooperative Control Scheme With Obstacle Avoidance for a Team of Mobile Robots nan The problem of formation control of a team of mobile robots based on the virtual and behavioral structures is considered in this paper. In the virtual structure, each mobile robot is modeled by an electric charge. The mobile robots move toward a circle, and due to repulsive forces between the identical charges, regular polygon formations of the mobile robots will be realized. For swarm formation, a virtual mobile robot is located at the center of the circle, and other mobile robots follow it. In the introduced approach, each mobile robot finds its position in the formation autonomously, and the formation can change automatically in the case of change in the number of the mobile robots. This paper also proposes a technique for avoiding obstacles based on the behavioral structure. In this technique, when a mobile robot gets close to an obstacle, while moving toward its target, a rotational potential field is applied to lead the mobile robot to avoid the obstacle, without locating in local minimum positions."

In such a framework, the multi-agent team can achieve consensus at any preset time. In order to reach this goal, linear feedback control protocols with time-varying gains are introduced. The proposed time-varying control protocols can solve consensus problems at the preset time if the undirected communication topology is connected. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results."

14,4,"This research aims to optimize conversational commerce involving multilingual consumers through large language models' natural language understanding abilities by developing a hybrid human-AI setup that leverages LLMs for named entity recognition, enhancing user experience during key order-to-cash steps.",376,"Optimizing Conversational Commerce Involving Multilingual Consumers Through Large Language Models' Natural Language Understanding Abilities nan Due to the emergence of natural language processing (NLP) interfaces, there has been growing intent to use conversational channels for commerce. Beyond customer service, NLP-enabled AI agents are being integrated into various steps of the order-to-cash (OTC) process. Social media and messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger have become pivotal for businesses, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but adoption has been limited. In addition, attitudes towards fully-automated conversational agents (CA) have been mixed, and there is room for human involvement in transactional conversations. A distinguishing contribution of this research is leveraging the inherent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling multilingual conversations and extracting transactional details through named entity recognition (NER). The study describes a hybrid human-AI setup augmenting agents with an auto-agent leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities, designed using the OTC process pattern applied to conversational UX frameworks. A prototype of the setup aims to streamline operations and reduce errors by enhancing the user experience during key OTC steps through improved conversational design. Recognizing the irreplaceable essence of human interaction, the hybrid human-in-the-loop approach was chosen, mitigating the impersonal nature of full automation. A prototype handling customers and humans augmented by LLMs for NER handling of transaction, customer, and product information was built. Sample synthetic bilingual conversations between customers and sales agents were generated using ChatGPT and fed into the system for evaluation."

21,7,"AI planning techniques can be extended to coordinate teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic, communication-constrained environments.",2038,"Coordinating UAVs in Dynamic Environments by Network-Aware Mission Planning nan Traditional AI planning has been used successfully in many domains, including logistics, scheduling and game playing. This paper examines how AI planning techniques can be extended to coordinate teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments. Specifically challenging are real-world environments where UAVs and other network-enabled devices must communicate to coordinate- and communication actions are neither reliable nor free. Such network-centric environments are common in military, public safety and commercial applications, yet most planning research (even multi-agent planning) usually takes communications among distributed agents as a given. The emerging application challenge of unmanned systems makes this problem of central focus. This work examines the problem of planning, plan monitoring and coordination of the mission of multiple UAVs in a communication-constrained environment. The work introduces several abstractions that enable AI planners to reason about communication and networking knowledge; and provides the underlying network system the means for including mission data as part of network operations. This work has been empirically validated using a distributed network-centric software evaluation testbed and the results provide guidance to designers in how to understand and control intelligent systems that operate in these environments."
