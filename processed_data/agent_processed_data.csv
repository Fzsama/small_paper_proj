0,An Evaluation of Situational Autonomy for Human-AI Collaboration in a Shared Workspace Setting,2024,"Designing interactions for human-AI teams (HATs) can be challenging due to an AI agent's potential autonomy. Previous work suggests that higher autonomy does not always improve team performance, and situation-dependent autonomy adaptation might be beneficial. However, there is a lack of systematic empirical evaluations of such autonomy adaptation in human-AI interaction. Therefore, we propose a cooperative task in a simulated shared workspace to investigate effects of fixed levels of AI autonomy and situation-dependent autonomy adaptation on team performance and user satisfaction. We derive adaptation rules for AI autonomy from previous work and a pilot study. We implement these rule for our main experiment and find that team performance was best when humans collaborated with an agent adjusting its autonomy based on the situation. Additionally, users rated this agent highest in terms of perceived intelligence. From these results, we discuss the influence of varying autonomy degrees on HATs in shared workspaces.",,第1页.xls

2,"Supporting Human-AI Teams:Transparency, explainability and situation awareness",2023,"System autonomy and AI are being developed for a wide variety of applications where they will likely work in tandem with people, forming human-AI teams (HAT). Situation awareness (SA) of autonomous systems and AI has been established as critical for effective interaction and oversight of these systems. As AI capabilities grow, and more effective teaming behaviors are expected of AI systems, there will also be an increased need for shared SA between the human and AI teammates. Methods for supporting team SA within HAT are discussed in terms of team SA requirements, team SA mechanisms, team SA displays and team SA processes. A framework for understanding the types of information that needs to be shared within HAT is provided, including a focus on taskwork SA, agent SA, and teamwork SA. AI based on learning systems creates new challenges for the development of good SA and mental models. AI transparency and explainability are discussed in terms of their separate roles for supporting SA and mental models in HAT. The SA Oriented Design (SAOD) process is described as a systematic methodology for developing transparent AI displays for HAT and an example of its application to automated driving in a Tesla is provided.

3,Modeling Trust Dimensions and Dynamics in Human-Agent Conversation: A Trajectory Epistemic Network Analysis Approach,2024,"Human-AI conversation provides a natural, unobtrusive, yet under-explored way to investigate trust dynamics in human-AI teams (HATs). In this paper, we modeled dynamic trust evolution in conversations using a novel method, trajectory epistemic network analysis (T-ENA). T-ENA captures the multidimensional aspect of trust (i.e., analytic and affective), and trajectory analysis segments conversations to capture temporal changes of trust over time. Twenty-four participants performed a habitat maintenance task assisted by a conversational agent and verbalized their experiences and feelings after each task. T-ENA showed that agent reliability significantly affected people's conversations in the analytic process of trust, t(38.88)=15.18,p<0.001,Cohen's d=4.72, such as discussing agents' errors. The trajectory analysis showed that trust dynamics manifested through conversation topic diversity and flow. These results showed trust dimensions and dynamics in conversation should be considered interdependently and suggested that an adaptive conversational strategy for managing trust in HATs.",,第1页.xls
4,Understanding the influence of AI autonomy on AI explainability levels in human-AI teams using a mixed methods approach,2024,"An obstacle to effective teaming between humans and AI is the agent's black box design. AI explanations have proven benefits, but few studies have explored the effects that explanations can have in a teaming environment with AI agents operating at heightened levels of autonomy. We conducted two complementary studies, an experiment and participatory design sessions, investigating the effect that varying levels of AI explainability and AI autonomy have on the participants' perceived trust and competence of an AI teammate to address this research gap. The results of the experiment were counter-intuitive, where the participants actually perceived the lower explainability agent as both more trustworthy and more competent. The participatory design sessions further revealed how a team's need to know influences when and what teammates need explained from AI teammates. Based on these findings, several design recommendations were developed for the HCI community to guide how AI teammates should share decision information with their human counterparts considering the careful balance between trust and competence in human-AI teams.",,第1页.xls
5,Modeling and Guiding the Creation of Ethical Human-Al Teams,2021,"With artificial intelligence continuing to advance, so too do the ethical concerns that can potentially negatively impact humans and the greater society. When these systems begin to interact with humans, these concerns become much more complex and much more important. The field of human-AI teaming provides a relevant example of how AI ethics can have significant and continued effects on humans. This paper reviews research in ethical artificial intelligence, as well as ethical teamwork through the lens of the rapidly advancing field of human-AI teaming, resulting in a model demonstrating the requirements and outcomes of building ethical human-AI teams. The model is created to guide the prioritization of ethics in human-AI teaming by outlining the ethical teaming process, outcomes of ethical teams, and external requirements necessary to ensure ethical human-AI teams. A final discussion is presented on how the developed model will influence the implementation of AI teammates, as well as the development of policy and regulation surrounding the domain in the coming years.",,第1页.xls
6,Social perception in Human-AI teams: Warmth and competence predict receptivity to AI teammates,2023,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise a future where teams consist of people and intelligent machines, such as robots or virtual agents. In order for human-AI teams (HATs) to succeed, human team members will need to be receptive to their new AI counterparts. In this study, we draw on a tripartite model of human newcomer receptivity, which includes three components: reflection, knowledge utilization, and psychological acceptance. We hypothesize that two aspects of social perception-warmth and competence-are critical predictors of human receptivity to a new AI teammate. Study 1 uses a video vignette design in which participants imagine adding one of eight AI teammates to a referent team. Study 2 leverages a Wizard of Oz methodology in laboratory teams. In addition to testing the effects of perceived warmth and competence on receptivity components, Study 2 also explores the influence of receptivity components on perceived HAT viability. Though both studies find that perceived warmth and competence affect receptivity, we find competence is particularly important for knowledge utilization and psychological acceptance. Further, results of Study 2 show that psychological acceptance is positively related to perceived HAT viability. Implications for future research on social perception of AI teammates are discussed.

7,HACO: A Framework for Developing Human-AI Teaming,2020,"We witnessed great advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) powered technologies over the past few decades. Wide use of AI technologies has led to the creation of an ecosystem where human and AI systems are partners, complementing each other with their strengths. To build a successful human-AI team, there are several considerations, including context awareness, effective communication, pro-activeness, etc. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of human-AI teaming concepts. We extend a multi-agent framework, Java Agent Development Framework ( JADE), to support the proposed taxonomy. Our solution framework, Human-AI Collaboration (HACO), enables a model-driven development of human-AI teaming systems through graphical user interface. In this paper, we present the solution architecture for extending JADE with human-AI teaming taxonomy. A user study performed to assess the usefulness of HACO, shows that HACO is a promising framework. We evaluated the proposed framework by developing a set of use cases for a contact center and observed a signification reduction in the overall development effort.",,第1页.xls

9,The role of shared mental models in human-AI teams: a theoretical review,2023,"Mental models are knowledge structures employed by humans to describe, explain, and predict the world around them. Shared Mental Models (SMMs) occur in teams whose members have similar mental models of their task and of the team itself. Research on human teaming has linked SMM quality to improved team performance. Applied understanding of SMMs should lead to improvements in human-AI teaming. Yet, it remains unclear how the SMM construct may differ in teams of human and AI agents, how and under what conditions such SMMs form, and how they should be quantified. This paper presents a review of SMMs and the associated literature, including their definition, measurement, and relation to other concepts. A synthesized conceptual model is proposed for the application of SMM literature to the human-AI setting. Several areas of AI research are identified and reviewed that are highly relevant to SMMs in human-AI teaming but which have not been discussed via a common vernacular. A summary of design considerations to support future experiments regarding Human-AI SMMs is presented. We find that while current research has made significant progress, a lack of consistency in terms and of effective means for measuring Human-AI SMMs currently impedes realization of the concept.",,第1页.xls
10,More than Task Performance: Developing New Criteria for Successful Human-AI Teaming Using the Cooperative Card Game Hanabi,2024,"As we shift to designing AI agents as teammates rather than tools, the social aspects of human-AI interaction become more pronounced. Consequently, to develop agents that are able to navigate the social dynamics that accompany cooperative teamwork, evaluation criteria that refer only to objective task performance will not be sufficient. We propose perceived cooperativity and teaming perception as subjective metrics for investigating successful human-AI teaming. Corresponding questionnaire scales were developed and tested in a pilot study employing the collaborative card game Hanabi, which has been identified as a unique setting for investigating human-AI teaming. Preliminary descriptive results suggest that rule-based and reinforcement learning-based agents differ in terms of perceived cooperativity and teaming perception. Future work will extend the results in a large user study to psychometrically evaluate the scales and test a conceptual framework that includes further aspects related to social dynamics in human-AI teaming.",,第1页.xls
11,"I Know This Looks Bad, But I Can Explain: Understanding When AI Should Explain Actions In Human-AI Teams",2024,"Explanation of artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making has become an important research area in humancomputer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported teamwork research. While plenty of research has investigated AI explanations with an intent to improve AI transparency and human trust in AI, how AI explanations function in teaming environments remains unclear. Given that a major benefit of AI giving explanations is to increase human trust understanding howAI explanations impact human trust is crucial to effective human-AI teamwork. An online experiment was conducted with 156 participants to explore this question by examining how a teammate's explanations impact the perceived trust of the teammate and the effectiveness of the team and how these impacts vary based on whether the teammate is a human or an AI. This study shows that explanations facilitate trust in AI teammates when explaining why AI disobeyed humans' orders but hindered trust when explaining why an AI lied to humans. In addition, participants' personal characteristics (e.g., their gender and the individual's ethical framework) impacted their perceptions of AI teammates both directly and indirectly in different scenarios. Our study contributes to interactive intelligent systems and HCI by shedding light on how an AI teammate's actions and corresponding explanations are perceived by humans while identifying factors that impact trust and perceived effectiveness. This work provides an initial understanding of AI explanations in human-AI teams, which can be used for future research to build upon in exploring AI explanation implementation in collaborative environments.",,第1页.xls

13,JSwarm: A Jingulu-Inspired Human-AI-Teaming Language for Context-Aware Swarm Guidance,2022,"Bi-directional communication between humans and swarm systems begs for efficient languages to communicate information between the humans and the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled agents in a manner that is most appropriate for the context. We discuss the criteria for effective teaming and functional bi-directional communication between humans and AI, and the design choices required to create effective languages. We then present a human-AI-teaming communication language inspired by the Australian Aboriginal language of Jingulu, which we call JSwarm. We present the motivation and structure of the language. An example is used to demonstrate how the language operates for a shepherding swarm guidance task.",,第1页.xls
14,Human-AI teaming: leveraging transactive memory and speaking up for enhanced team effectiveness.,2023,"In this prospective observational study, we investigate the role of transactive memory and speaking up in human-AI teams comprising 180 intensive care (ICU) physicians and nurses working with AI in a simulated clinical environment. Our findings indicate that interactions with AI agents differ significantly from human interactions, as accessing information from AI agents is positively linked to a team's ability to generate novel hypotheses and demonstrate speaking-up behavior, but only in higher-performing teams. Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team's transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up. Practical implications include suggestions for the design of future AI systems and human-AI team training in healthcare and beyond.",,第1页.xls
15,Artificial Trust as a Tool in Human-AI Teams,2022,"Mutual trust is considered a required coordinating mechanism for achieving effective teamwork in human teams. However, it is still a challenge to implement such mechanisms in teams composed by both humans and AI (human-AI teams), even though those are becoming increasingly prevalent. Agents in such teams should not only be trustworthy and promote appropriate trust from the humans, but also know when to trust a human teammate to perform a certain task. In this project, we study trust as a tool for artificial agents to achieve better team work. In particular, we want to build mental models of humans so that agents can understand human trustworthiness in the context of human-AI teamwork, taking into account factors such as human teammates', task's and environment's characteristics.",,第1页.xls

17,Humans as teammates: The signal of human-AI teaming enhances consumer acceptance of chatbots,2024,"Human-artificial intelligence (AI) teaming is a service system in which AI agents work interdependently toward a common goal alongside human agents. Although many consumer services rely on chatbots working with humans, little is known about the influence of human-AI teaming on consumers' perceptions and use of chatbots in online service encounters. Using signaling theory, the present research examines whether and how human-AI teaming (vs. independent AI) increases consumer acceptance of chatbots. Through six scenario-based studies and an interview, we found that human-AI teaming can use human capabilities to endorse the effectiveness and authenticity of AI, leading to increased chatbot acceptance. However, this effect was not observed when AI capability was clear or the human service experience was negative. We contribute to information systems research by showing the mechanism and boundary conditions underlying the effect of human-AI teaming on chatbot acceptance. We also provide practical insights for managers emphasizing how human teammates in AI-consumer conversations can increase consumer acceptance of AI. All rights reserved Elsevier.",,第1页.xls
18,Modeling Goal Alignment in Human-AI Teaming: A Dynamic Game Theory Approach,2022,"As human-AI teaming becomes increasingly prevalent, goal alignment has emerged as a critical yet unsolved issue. Misaligned goals can be amplified by the situation and strategic interactions, which can further impact the teaming process and performance. These interrelated factors lack a systematic and computational model. To address this gap, we developed a dynamic game theoretical framework simulating the human-AI interdependency by integrating the Drift Diffusion Model simulating the goal alignment process. A 3 (Situation Structure) x 3 (Strategic Behaviors) x 2 (Initial Goal Alignment) simulation study of human-AI teaming was designed. Results showed that teaming with an altruistic agent in a competitive situation leads to the highest team performance. Moreover, goal alignment process can dissolve the initial goal conflict. Our study provides a first step of modeling goal alignment and implies a tradeoff between a balanced and cooperative team to guide human-AI teaming design.",,第1页.xls
19,Adapt and overcome: Perceptions of adaptive autonomous agents for human-AI teaming,2023,"Rapid advances in AI technologies have caused teams to explore the use of AI agents as full, active members of the team. The complex environments that teams occupy require human team members to constantly adapt their behaviors, and thus the ability of AI teammates to similarly adapt to changing situations significantly enhances the team's chances to succeed. In order to design such agents, it is important that we understand not only how to identify the amount of autonomous control AI agents have over their decisions, but also how changes to this control cognitively affects the rest of the team. Professional organizations often break their work cycles into phases that set limits on the team members' actions, and we propose that a similar process could be used to define the autonomy levels of AI teammates. Cyber incident response is an ideal context for this proposal, as we were able to use incident response phases to explore how a team's work cycle could guide an AI agent's changing level of autonomy. Using a mixed methods approach, we recruited 103 participants to complete a factorial survey containing ten contextual vignettes focused on an AI teammate's level of autonomy in incident response contexts, and from these participants we conducted twenty-two follow-on qualitative interviews that further explored how the participants felt an AI agent's adaptive capabilities would affect team performance and cohesiveness. Our results showed that work cycles can be used to assign autonomy levels to adaptive AI agents based upon the degree of formal processes and predictability of the team's tasks during the cycle, and that dynamic, human-like adaptation methods are vital to effective human-AI teams. This research provides significant contributions to the HCI community by proposing design recommendations for the development of adaptive autonomous teammates that both enhance Human-AI teams' productivity and promote positive team dynamics.

20,Human-AI teams-Challenges for a team-centered AI at work.,2023,"As part of the Special Issue topic Human-Centered AI at Work: Common Ground in Theories and Methods, we present a perspective article that looks at human-AI teamwork from a team-centered AI perspective, i. e., we highlight important design aspects that the technology needs to fulfill in order to be accepted by humans and to be fully utilized in the role of a team member in teamwork. Drawing from the model of an idealized teamwork process, we discuss the teamwork requirements for successful human-AI teaming in interdependent and complex work domains, including e.g., responsiveness, situation awareness, and flexible decision-making. We emphasize the need for team-centered AI that aligns goals, communication, and decision making with humans, and outline the requirements for such team-centered AI from a technical perspective, such as cognitive competence, reinforcement learning, and semantic communication. In doing so, we highlight the challenges and open questions associated with its implementation that need to be solved in order to enable effective human-AI teaming.",,第1页.xls
21,Human-AI teams in complex military operations: Soldiers' perception of intelligent AI agents as teammates in human-AI teams,2023,"Military decision-making frequently involves complex problems in non-routine situations with minimal rule-based or automated solutions. As human information processing capabilities are limited, processing the required scale of information increases the decision-makers' workload, impacting their situational awareness and affecting the quality of soldiers' decisions. This study uses a route clearance task as a use-case scenario to understand the issues in team-level decision-making in military tasks, the challenges in successfully completing the mission, and the demands placed on AI teammates when working in a human-AI team. We interviewed eight subject matter experts with prior experience in route clearance operations. The themes generated by analyzing the interview transcripts provide insights into soldiers' perceptions of AI teammates as well as recommendations for successfully integrating human-AI teams in military settings.",,第1页.xls
22,CREW: Facilitating Human-AI Teaming Research,2024,"With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.",,第1页.xls
23,How Being Outvoted by AI Teammates Impacts Human-AI Collaboration,2024,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) enable AI agents to go beyond simply supporting human activities and, instead, take more control in team decision-making. While significant literature has studied human-AI collaboration through the lens of AI as a second opinion system, this type of interaction is not fully representative of many human-human team collaboration scenarios, such as scenarios where each decision maker is granted equal voting rights for the team decision. In this research, we explore how imparting AI agents with equal voting rights to the human impacts human-AI decision-making and team performance. Using a human subjects experiment in which participants collaborate with two AI teammates for truss structure (aka, bridge) design, we manipulate a series of voting scenarios (e.g., AI agents outvoting the human vs. AI agents agreeing with the human) and AI performance levels (high vs. low performing). The results indicate that changes in human self-confidence are not consistent with whether the quality of the final team-voted design action is advantageous or disadvantageous relative to their own actions. The results also show that when humans are outvoted by their AI teammates, they do not show strong negative emotional reactions if the team-voted decision has an advantageous outcome. Additionally, AI performance significantly influences the human-AI team decision-making process and even one low-performing AI (i.e., an AI that is frequently incorrect) on the team can significantly deteriorate team performance. Taken together, this research provides empirical evidence on the effects of AI voting with equal decision authority on human-AI collaboration, as well as valuable insights supporting real-world applications of human-AI collaboration via voting.",,第1页.xls
24,New research paradigms and agenda of human factors science in the intelligence era,2024,"This paper first proposes the innovative concept of human factors science to characterize engineering psychology, human factors engineering, ergonomics, human-computer interaction, and other similar fields. Although the perspectives in these fields differ, they share a common goal: optimizing the human-machine relationship by applying a human-centered design approach. AI technology has brought in new characteristics, and our recent research reveals that the human-machine relationship presents a trans-era evolution from human-machine interaction to human-AI teaming. These changes have raised questions and challenges for human factors science, compelling us to re-examine current research paradigms and agendas. In this context, this paper reviews and discusses the implications of the following three conceptual models and frameworks that we recently proposed to enrich the research paradigms for human factors science. (1) human-AI joint cognitive systems: this model differs from the traditional human-computer interaction paradigm and regards an intelligent system as a cognitive agent with a certain level of cognitive capabilities. Thus, a human-AI system can be characterized as a joint cognitive system in which two cognitive agents (human and intelligent agents) work as teammates for collaboration. (2) human-AI joint cognitive ecosystems: an intelligent ecosystem with multiple human-AI systems can be represented as a human-AI joint cognitive ecosystem. The overall system performance of the intelligent ecosystem depends on optimal collaboration and design across the multiple human-AI systems. (3) intelligent sociotechnical systems (iSTS): human-AI systems are designed, developed, and deployed in an iSTS environment. From a macro perspective, iSTS focuses on the interdependency between the technical and social subsystems. The successful design, development, and deployment of a human-AI system within an iSTS environment depends on the synergistic optimization between the two subsystems. This paper further enhances these frameworks from the research paradigm perspective. We propose three new research paradigms for human factors science in the intelligence ear: human-AI joint cognitive systems, human-AI joint cognitive ecosystems, and intelligent sociotechnical systems, enabling comprehensive human factors solutions for AI-based intelligent systems. Further analyses show that the three new research paradigms will benefit future research in human factors science. Furthermore, this paper looks forward to the future research agenda of human factors science from three aspects: human-AI interaction, intelligent human-machine interface, and human-AI teaming. We believe the proposed research paradigms and the future research agenda will mutually promote each other, further advancing human factors science in the intelligence era.",,第1页.xls
25,Human-AI Symbiosis: A Survey of Current Approaches [arXiv],2021,"In this paper, we aim at providing a comprehensive outline of the different threads of work in human-AI collaboration. By highlighting various aspects of works on the human-AI team such as the flow of complementing, task horizon, model representation, knowledge level, and teaming goal, we make a taxonomy of recent works according to these dimensions. We hope that the survey will provide a more clear connection between the works in the human-AI team and guidance to new researchers in this area.",,第1页.xls
26,On the Utility of External Agent Intention Predictor for Human-AI Coordination,2024,"Reaching a consensus on the team plans is vital to human-AI coordination. Although previous studies provide approaches through communications in various ways, it could still be hard to coordinate when the AI has no explainable plan to communicate. To cover this gap, we suggest incorporating external models to assist humans in understanding the intentions of AI agents. In this paper, we propose a two-stage paradigm that first trains a Theory of Mind (ToM) model from collected offline trajectories of the target agent, and utilizes the model in the process of human-AI collaboration by real-timely displaying the future action predictions of the target agent. Such a paradigm leaves the AI agent as a black box and thus is available for improving any agents. To test our paradigm, we further implement a transformer-based predictor as the ToM model and develop an extended online human-AI collaboration platform for experiments. The comprehensive experimental results verify that human-AI teams can achieve better performance with the help of our model. A user assessment attached to the experiment further demonstrates that our paradigm can significantly enhance the situational awareness of humans. Our study presents the potential to augment the ability of humans via external assistance in human-AI collaboration, which may further inspire future research.",,第1页.xls
27,Trustworthy human-AI partnerships,2021,"In this paper, we foreground some of the key research challenges that arise in the design of trustworthy human-AI partnerships. In particular, we focus on the challenges in designing human-AI partnerships that need to be addressed to help humans and organizations trust their machine counterparts individually or as a collective (e.g., as robot teams or groups of software agents). We also aim to identify the risks associatedwith human-AI partnerships and therefore determine the associated measures to mitigate these risks. By so doing, we will trigger new avenues of research that will address the key barriers to the adoption of AI-based systems more widely in our daily lives and in industry.",,第1页.xls
28,SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: Profiling Artificial Intelligence as a Material for User Experience Design,2021,"HCI has become especially interested in the promises and challenges of user experience of AI, such as user acceptance, human-agent teamwork, and accessibility. Less discussed, however, is that the field of HCI routinely grapples with such challenges; across the various technologies commonly referred to as AI (e.g., predictive modeling, computer vision, NLP), what shared characteristics made human-AI interaction appeared uniquely difficult to design in the first place? Synthesizing my hands-on design and research over the past six years, in my dissertation, I worked to articulate whether, why, and how human-AI interaction appears uniquely challenging to design with established HCI methods. In this extended abstract, I first describe a human-AI interaction design framework as an answer to this question. I then discuss one critical implication of this framework: Framing data-driven AI systems as living socio-technical systems that co-evolve with their users. I analogize this reframing to the shift from desktop computing to ubiquitous computing and outline the ethnographic, design, and technological research opportunities it reveals.",,第1页.xls
29,When Should I Lead or Follow: Understanding Initiative Levels in Human-AI Collaborative Gameplay,2024,"Dynamics in Human-AI interaction should lead to more satisfying and engaging collaboration. Key open questions are how to design such interactions and the role personal goals and expectations play. We developed three AI partners of varying initiative (leader, follower, shifting) in a collaborative game called Geometry Friends. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 60 participants to assess personal AI partner preference and performance satisfaction as well as perceived warmth and competence of AI partners. Results show that AI partners following human initiative are perceived as warmer and more collaborative. However, some participants preferred AI leaders for their independence and speed, despite being seen as less friendly. This suggests that assigning a leadership role to the AI partner may be suitable for time-sensitive scenarios. We identify design factors for developing collaborative AI agents with varying levels of initiative to create more effective human-AI teams that consider context and individual preference.",,第1页.xls
30,A Study of Drone-based AI for Enhanced Human-AI Trust and Informed Decision Making in Human-AI Interactive Virtual Environments,2022,"Search and Rescue Operations (SRO) are notoriously difficult as they typically involve human operations in high risk and low visibility environments. Often, stakeholders only have a general perception of the possible adversities in the situational environment. Ultimately, the success of these operations is a function of the manpower available, the terrain of the region, informed-decision-making based on terrain mapping and objective success in completion of search and rescue tasks with lower human casualties. A practical solution to this problem is to leverage the use of autonomous systems such as drones and rescue robots that can scout the terrain to gather information to augment the rescue team's capabilities and mission success rates. In situations, such as a combat search and rescue mission, the mission might call for a cooperative effort between a Human and AI Agent, whereby both are able to share intelligence and coordinate in decision-making tasks. In this work, we present several novel contributions through a combat search and rescue simulation scenario that leverages a drone-based AI autonomous system for detection of targets-of-interest in the environment as a basis for human-AI teaming study. In this research, we examine various human factor metrics for different modes of interactions between the human agent and AI-driven drone/autonomous system agent to include implications on human mission completion with and without drone-based AI target detection-derived human situational awareness and time to mission completion. In addition, we introduce innovative AI techniques to model human agent (player) - AI agent (drone) exchanges through a hostage rescue scenario-based simulation and explore incentive strategies directed towards the human agent to encourage adoption of AI-based autonomous system as a cooperative intelligence asset and improve human-AI teaming performance. The unification of both AI techniques to model Human-AI interaction and incentive mechanisms to encourage usage of autonomous systems sets the foundation for assessing the efficacy of AI in Human Agent Teams.",,第1页.xls

32,SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: Profiling Artificial Intelligence as a Material for User Experience Design,2021,"HCI has become especially interested in the promises and challenges of user experience of AI, such as user acceptance, human-agent teamwork, and accessibility. Less discussed, however, is that the field of HCI routinely grapples with such challenges; across the various technologies commonly referred to as AI (e.g., predictive modeling, computer vision, NLP), what shared characteristics made human-AI interaction appeared uniquely difficult to design in the first place? Synthesizing my hands-on design and research over the past six years, in my dissertation, I worked to articulate whether, why, and how human-AI interaction appears uniquely challenging to design with established HCI methods. In this extended abstract, I first describe a human-AI interaction design framework as an answer to this question. I then discuss one critical implication of this framework: Framing data-driven AI systems as living socio-technical systems that co-evolve with their users. I analogize this reframing to the shift from desktop computing to ubiquitous computing and outline the ethnographic, design, and technological research opportunities it reveals.",,第1页.xls
33,Transdisciplinary Team Science: Transcending Disciplines to Understand Artificial Social Intelligence in Human-Agent Teaming,2023,"We provide a transdisciplinary viewpoint on creating artificial social intelligence for human-agent teaming. We discuss theoretical, methodological, and technological insights, drawn from different disciplines, to more fully illuminate how cross-disciplinary research can inform research design and development. We unite ideas spanning human factors, cognitive and computer science, and organizational behavior. Grounding our ideas in real world challenges for human-AI teaming, and via a series of questions designed to facilitate synthesis across disciplines, we illustrate how transdisciplinary team science more effectively asks and answers complex questions on human-agent teaming. Our objective is to contribute to research and development in the field of human-AI and human-robot teaming by emphasizing a more human-centered perspective on AI.",,第1页.xls
34,Developing human/AI interactions for chat-based customer services: lessons learned from the Norwegian government,2023,"Advancements in human/AI interactions led to smartification of public services via the use of chatbots. Here, we present findings from a clinical inquiry research project in a key public service organisation in Norway. In this project, researchers and practitioners worked together to generate insights on the action possibilities offered to human service agents by chatbots and the potential for creating hybrid human/AI service teams. The project sensitised service agents to discover affordances based on their actual practices, rather than on the predefined use of chatbots. The different affordances identified can be useful for practitioners who design and deploy chatbot-based services. The action possibilities afforded by chatbots provide new ways for service agents and chatbots to work as a team addressing citizens' needs. Drawing from the whole research process, we offer three lessons learned from the Norwegian Government on human/AI partnerships, theory-based interventions, and institutionalised collaborative research that can be useful for researchers that want to engage with practice and organisations that want to evolve their technology use, stimulate innovation, and engage with research.",,第1页.xls
35,Disentangling Human-AI Hybrids Conceptualizing the Interworking of Humans and AI-Enabled Systems,2023,"Artificial intelligence (AI) offers great potential in organizations. The path to achieving this potential will involve human-AI interworking, as has been confirmed by numerous studies. However, it remains to be explored which direction this interworking of human agents and AI-enabled systems ought to take. To date, research still lacks a holistic understanding of the entangled interworking that characterizes human-AI hybrids, so-called because they form when human agents and AI-enabled systems closely collaborate. To enhance such understanding, this paper presents a taxonomy of human-AI hybrids, developed by reviewing the current literature as well as a sample of 101 human-AI hybrids. Leveraging weak sociomateriality as justificatory knowledge, this study provides a deeper understanding of the entanglement between human agents and AI-enabled systems. Furthermore, a cluster analysis is performed to derive archetypes of human-AI hybrids, identifying ideal-typical occurrences of human-AI hybrids in practice. While the taxonomy creates a solid foundation for the understanding and analysis of human-AI hybrids, the archetypes illustrate the range of roles that AI-enabled systems can play in those interworking scenarios.",,第1页.xls
36,Trust Engineering for Human-AI Teams,2019,"Human-AI teaming refers to systems in which humans and artificial intelligence (AI) agents collaborate to provide significant mission performance improvements over that which humans or AI can achieve alone. The goal is faster and more accurate decision-making by integrating the rapid data ingest, learning, and analyses capabilities of AI with the creative problem solving and abstraction capabilities of humans. The purpose of this panel is to discuss research directions in Trust Engineering for building appropriate bi-directional trust between humans and AI. Discussions focus on the challenges in systems that are increasingly complex and work within imperfect information environments. Panelists provide their perspectives on addressing these challenges through concepts such as dynamic relationship management, adaptive systems, co-discovery learning, and algorithmic transparency.

38,Designing for Bi-directional Transparency in Human-AI-Robot-Teaming,2021,"This paper takes a practitioner's perspective on advancing bi-directional transparency in human-AI-robot teams (HARTs). Bi-directional transparency is important for HARTs because the better that people and artificially intelligent agents can understand one another's capabilities, limits, inputs, outputs and contexts in a given task environment; the better they can work as a team to accomplish shared goals, interdependent tasks, and overall missions. This understanding can be built, augmented, broken and repaired at various stages across the technology life cycle, including the conceptual design; iterative design of software, hardware and interfaces; marketing and sales; system training; operational use; and system updating and adaptation stages. This paper provides an overview of some best practices and challenges in building this bi-directional transparency at different points in the technology life cycle of human-AI-robot systems. The goal is to help advance a wider discussion and sharing of lessons learned from recent work in this area.",,第1页.xls
39,Evaluation of Human-AI Teams for Learned and Rule-Based Agents in Hanabi,2021,"Deep reinforcement learning has generated superhuman AI in competitive games such as Go and StarCraft. Can similar learning techniques create a superior AI teammate for human-machine collaborative games? Will humans prefer AI teammates that improve objective team performance or those that improve subjective metrics of trust? In this study, we perform a single-blind evaluation of teams of humans and AI agents in the cooperative card game Hanabi, with both rule-based and learning-based agents. In addition to the game score, used as an objective metric of the human-AI team performance, we also quantify subjective measures of the human's perceived performance, teamwork, interpretability, trust, and overall preference of AI teammate. We find that humans have a clear preference toward a rule-based AI teammate (SmartBot) over a state-of-the-art learning-based AI teammate (Other-Play) across nearly all subjective metrics, and generally view the learning-based agent negatively, despite no statistical difference in the game score. This result has implications for future AI design and reinforcement learning benchmarking, highlighting the need to incorporate subjective metrics of human-AI teaming rather than a singular focus on objective task performance.

40,Vero: An accessible method for studying human-AI teamwork,2023,"Despite the recognized need to prepare for a future of human-AI collaboration, the technical skills necessary to develop and deploy AI systems are considerable, making such research difficult to perform without specialized knowledge. To make human-AI collaboration research more accessible, we developed a novel experimental method that combines a standard video conferencing platform, a set of animations, and Wizard of Oz methods to simulate a group interaction with an AI teammate. Through a case study, we demonstrate the flexibility and ease of deployment of this approach. We also provide evidence that the method creates a highly believable experience of interacting with an AI agent. By detailing this method, we hope that researchers regardless of background can replicate it to more easily answer questions that will inform the design and development of future human-AI collaboration technologies.

41,Towards a Methodology for Developing Human-AI Collaborative Decision Support Systems,2023,"Decision-making is a complex activity, often demanding collaboration, sometimes even in the form of dynamic (ad hoc) teams of loosely coupled participants collected to deal with a particular problem. At the same time, recent developments in the AI have shown that AI plays an important role in decision-making, and AI-agents may become full-fledged participants of collaborative decision support systems. However, integration of AI-agents into collaborative processes requires solving a number of tasks concerning human-AI interaction, interpretability, mutual learning, etc. This paper is a step towards a methodology to create decision support systems based on human-AI collaboration. An analysis of typical requirements to the collaborative decision support systems and typical scenarios that such systems have to implement sustains the introduced methodology. Based on this analysis, foundational problems needed settlements to develop human-AI collaborative decision support systems have been identified, and their possible solutions are offered. In the proposed methodology, ontologies play an important role, providing interoperability among heterogeneous participants. The methodology implies a technological backing in the form of a collaborative computational environment, helping to develop decision support systems for particular domains.",,第1页.xls
42,Ontology-Based Reflective Communication for Shared Human-AI Recognition of Emergent Collaboration Patterns,2023,"When humans and AI-agents collaborate, they need to continuously learn about each other and the task. We propose a Team Design Pattern that utilizes adaptivity in the behavior of human and agent team partners, causing new Collaboration Patterns to emerge. Human-AI Co-Learning takes place when partners can formalize recognized patterns of collaboration in a commonly shared language, and can communicate with each other about these patterns. For this, we developed an ontology of Collaboration Patterns. An accompanying Graphical User Interface (GUI) enables partners to formalize and refine Collaboration Patterns, which can then be communicated to the partner. The ontology was evaluated empirically with human participants who viewed video recordings of joint human-agent activities. Participants were requested to identify Collaboration Patterns in the footage, and to formalize patterns by using the ontology's GUI. Results show that the ontology supports humans to recognize and define Collaboration Patterns successfully. To improve the ontology, it is suggested to include pre- and post-conditions of tasks, as well as parallel actions of team members.",,第1页.xls
43,"Towards Ethical AI: Empirically Investigating Dimensions of AI Ethics, Trust Repair, and Performance in Human-AI Teaming",2024,"Objective Determining the efficacy of two trust repair strategies (apology and denial) for trust violations of an ethical nature by an autonomous teammate. Background While ethics in human-AI interaction is extensively studied, little research has investigated how decisions with ethical implications impact trust and performance within human-AI teams and their subsequent repair. Method Forty teams of two participants and one autonomous teammate completed three team missions within a synthetic task environment. The autonomous teammate made an ethical or unethical action during each mission, followed by an apology or denial. Measures of individual team trust, autonomous teammate trust, human teammate trust, perceived autonomous teammate ethicality, and team performance were taken. Results Teams with unethical autonomous teammates had significantly lower trust in the team and trust in the autonomous teammate. Unethical autonomous teammates were also perceived as substantially more unethical. Neither trust repair strategy effectively restored trust after an ethical violation, and autonomous teammate ethicality was not related to the team score, but unethical autonomous teammates did have shorter times. Conclusion Ethical violations significantly harm trust in the overall team and autonomous teammate but do not negatively impact team score. However, current trust repair strategies like apologies and denials appear ineffective in restoring trust after this type of violation. Application This research highlights the need to develop trust repair strategies specific to human-AI teams and trust violations of an ethical nature.",,第1页.xls
44,Effective Human-AI Teams via Learned Natural Language Rules and Onboarding [arXiv],2023,"People are relying on AI agents to assist them with various tasks. The human must know when to rely on the agent, collaborate with the agent, or ignore its suggestions. In this work, we propose to learn rules grounded in data regions and described in natural language that illustrate how the human should collaborate with the AI. Our novel region discovery algorithm finds local regions in the data as neighborhoods in an embedding space that corrects the human prior. Each region is then described using an iterative and contrastive procedure where a large language model describes the region. We then teach these rules to the human via an onboarding stage. Through user studies on object detection and question-answering tasks, we show that our method can lead to more accurate human-AI teams. We also evaluate our region discovery and description algorithms separately.",,第1页.xls
45,Ontology-Based Explanations of Neural Networks for Collaborative Human-AI Decision Support Systems,2023,"Collaborative decision support systems, including both human experts and AI-based agents can lift decision support to a new level, helping end users to make informed and justified decisions in complex dynamic problem domains. However, human-AI collaboration still has some problematic aspects, one of which is the lack of trust to AI agents, caused by insufficient understanding of why these agents make certain decisions. In this paper, we analyze existing approaches to ontology-based explanation of neural AI agents. These approaches are then used to develop a conceptual model of neural explanation and human-AI interaction mechanisms aimed at explanation exchange. The proposed model will be used in the human-AI collaborative decision support system based on ontology-based neuro-symbolic AI.",,第1页.xls
46,Remote research methods for Human-AI-Robot Teaming,2022,"This study focuses on methodological adaptations and considerations for remote research on Human-AI-Robot Teaming (HART) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Themes and effective remote research methods were explored. Central issues in remote research were identified, such as challenges in attending to participants' experiences, coordinating experimenter teams remotely, and protecting privacy and confidentiality. Instances of experimental design overcoming these challenges were identified in methods for recruitment and onboarding, training, team task scenarios, and measurement. Three case studies are presented in which interactive in-person testbeds for HART were rapidly redesigned to function remotely. Although COVID-19 may have temporarily constrained experimental design, future HART studies may adopt remote research methods to expand the research toolkit.",,第1页.xls
47,Trust in an AI versus a Human teammate: The effects of teammate identity and performance on Human-AI cooperation,2023,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) enable researchers to create more powerful AI agents that are becoming competent teammates for humans. However, human distrust of AI is a critical factor that may impede human-AI cooperation. Although AI agents have been endowed with anthropomorphic traits, such as a human-like appearance, in prior studies to improve human trust in AI, it is still an open question whether humans have more trust in an AI teammate and achieve better human-AI joint performance if they are deceived about the identity of their AI teammate as another human. This research assesses the effects of teammate identity (human vs. AI) and teammate performance (low-performing vs. high-performing AI) on human-AI cooperation through a human subjects study. The results of this study show that humans behaviorally trust the AI more than another human by accepting their AI teammate's decisions more often. In addition, teammate performance has a significant effect on human-AI joint performance in the study, while teammate identity does not. These results caution against deceiving humans about the identity of AI in future applications involving human-AI cooperation. All rights reserved Elsevier.",,第1页.xls
48,AI-ACCELERATED DESIGN OF EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS FOR GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT,2023,"When designing evidence-based policies and programs, decision-makers must distill key information from a vast and rapidly growing literature base. Identifying relevant literature from raw search results is time and resource intensive, and is often done by manual screening. In this study, we develop an AI agent based on a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and incorporate it into a human team designing an evidence synthesis product for global development. We explore the effectiveness of the human-AI hybrid team in accelerating the evidence synthesis process. To further improve team efficiency, we enhance the human-AI hybrid team through active learning (AL). Specifically, we explore different sampling strategies, including random sampling, least confidence (LC) sampling, and highest priority (HP) sampling, to study their influence on the collaborative screening process. Results show that incorporating the BERT-based AI agent into the human team can reduce the human screening effort by 68.5% compared to the case of no AI assistance and by 16.8% compared to the industry standard of using an n-gram language model to encode texts and a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier for identifying 80% of all relevant documents. When we apply the HP sampling strategy for AL, the human screening effort can be reduced even more to 78.3% for identifying 80% of all relevant documents compared to no AI assistance. We apply the AL-enhanced human-AI hybrid teaming workflow in the design process of three evidence gap maps (EGMs) for USAID and find it to be highly effective. These findings demonstrate how AI can accelerate the development of evidence synthesis products and promote timely evidence-based decision making in global development in a human-AI hybrid teaming context.",,第1页.xls
49,Compensating for Sensing Failures via Delegation in Human-AI Hybrid Systems,2023,"Given the increasing prevalence of intelligent systems capable of autonomous actions or augmenting human activities, it is important to consider scenarios in which the human, autonomous system, or both can exhibit failures as a result of one of several contributing factors (e.g., perception). Failures for either humans or autonomous agents can lead to simply a reduced performance level, or a failure can lead to something as severe as injury or death. For our topic, we consider the hybrid human-AI teaming case where a managing agent is tasked with identifying when to perform a delegated assignment and whether the human or autonomous system should gain control. In this context, the manager will estimate its best action based on the likelihood of either (human, autonomous) agent's failure as a result of their sensing capabilities and possible deficiencies. We model how the environmental context can contribute to, or exacerbate, these sensing deficiencies. These contexts provide cases where the manager must learn to identify agents with capabilities that are suitable for decision-making. As such, we demonstrate how a reinforcement learning manager can correct the context-delegation association and assist the hybrid team of agents in outperforming the behavior of any agent working in isolation.",,第1页.xls
50,Queering AI: Undoing the self in the algorithmic borderlands,2024,"This paper challenges fixed orientations towards the self in human-AI entanglements. It offers queering as a strategy to subvert the individuation and fixing of identities within algorithmic systems and the loss of futurity that it brings about. By exploring queerness, the paper examines how one's sense of self and futurity are interpellated within the algorithmic borderlands of human-AI entanglements. The study discusses an embodied experiment called Undoing Gracia, a Digital Twin simulation where the first author Grace and their AI twins (Lex and Tortugi) interact within the fictional world of Gracia. The experiment probes into Grace's multifaceted subjectivities by conceiving themselves as interdependent entities evolving through their interactions within Gracia. The paper outlines the process of creating and implementing the simulation and examines how the agents co-perform and become-with alongside Gracia's making. The findings illuminate queer gestures for navigating human-AI entanglements in HCI research and practice, highlighting the importance of fluid identities in shaping human-AI relations.",,第1页.xls
51,Action Over Words: Predicting Human Trust in AI Partners Through Gameplay Behaviors,2024,"In the burgeoning field of human-AI interaction, trust emerges as a cornerstone because many think that it is critical to the effectiveness of collaboration and the acceptance of AI systems. Traditional methods of assessing trust have predominantly relied on self-reported measures, requiring participants to articulate their perceptions and attitudes through questionnaires. However, these explicit methods may not fully capture the nuanced dynamics of trust, especially in real-time and complex interaction environments. This paper introduces an innovative approach to evaluating trust in human-AI teams, pivoting from the conventional reliance on verbal or written feedback to analyzing gameplay behaviors as implicit indicators of trust levels. Utilizing the Overcooked-AI environment, our study explores how participants' interactions with AI agents of varying performance levels can reveal underlying trust mechanisms without a single query posed to the human players. This approach not only bypasses the efficiency challenges posed by repetitive and lengthy trust assessment methods, but also provides insights comparable to them. We highlight the potential of non-verbal cues and action patterns as reliable trust indicators by comparing the predictive accuracies of questionnaire-based models with those derived from gameplay behavior analysis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these implicit measures can be integrated into adaptive systems and algorithms for real-time trust calibration in human-agent teaming settings. This shift towards an action-oriented trust assessment challenges existing paradigms and opens new avenues for understanding and enhancing human-AI collaboration.",,第1页.xls
52,Surveying Teachers' Preferences and Boundaries Regarding Human-AI Control in Dynamic Pairing of Students for Collaborative Learning,2021,"Orchestration tools may support K-12 teachers in facilitating student learning, especially when designed to address classroom stakeholders' needs. Our previous work revealed a need for human-AI shared control when dynamically pairing students for collaborative learning in the classroom, but offered limited guidance on the role each agent should take. In this study, we designed storyboards for scenarios where teachers, students and AI co-orchestrate dynamic pairing when using AI-based adaptive math software for individual and collaborative learning. We surveyed 54 math teachers on their co-orchestration preferences. We found that teachers would like to share control with the AI to lessen their orchestration load. As well, they would like to have the AI propose student pairs with explanations, and identify risky proposed pairings. However, teachers are hesitant to let the AI auto-pair students even if they are busy, and are less inclined to let AI override teacher-proposed pairing. Our study contributes to teachers' needs, preference, and boundaries for how they want to share the task and control of student pairing with the AI and students, and design implications in human-AI co-orchestration tools.",,第1页.xls
53,The Hidden Rules of Hanabi: How Humans Outperform AI Agents,2023,"Games that feature multiple players, limited communication, and partial information are particularly challenging for AI agents. In the cooperative card game Hanabi, which possesses all of these attributes, AI agents fail to achieve scores comparable to even first-time human players. Through an observational study of three mixed-skill Hanabi play groups, we identify the techniques used by humans that help to explain their superior performance compared to AI. These concern physical artefact manipulation, coordination play, role establishment, and continual rule negotiation. Our findings extend previous accounts of human performance in Hanabi, which are purely in terms of theory-of-mind reasoning, by revealing more precisely how this form of collective decision-making is enacted in skilled human play. Our interpretation points to a gap in the current capabilities of AI agents to perform cooperative tasks.",,第1页.xls
54,A Survey of Collaborative Reinforcement Learning: Interactive Methods and Design Patterns,2021,"Recently, methods enabling humans and Artificial Intelligent (AI) agents to collaborate towards improving the efficiency of Reinforcement Learning - also called Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (CRL) - have been receiving increasing attention. In this paper, we provide a long-term, in-depth survey, investigating human-AI collaborative methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks, between 2011 and 2020. We elucidate and discuss synergistic analysis methods of both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we suggest novel technical directions and new collaboration design ideas. Specifically, we provide a new CRL classification taxonomy, as a systematic modelling tool for selecting and improving new CRL designs. Furthermore, we propose generic CRL challenges providing the research community with a guide towards effective implementation of human-AI collaboration. The aim is to empower researchers to develop more efficient and natural human-AI collaborative methods that could utilise the different strengths of humans and AI.",,第1页.xls
55,The Components of Trust for Collaborating With AI Colleagues,2022,"AI technologies are capable of improving the performance and productivity of teams in a variety of work contexts. These advantages may be optimized when the AI agent is considered a full team member. A vital component of the agent's acceptance as a team member or colleague is the degree to which its human coworkers feel they can trust it. To explore what factors affect the perceptions of an AI agent as a trustworthy team member and a legitimate colleague, we interviewed twenty-two professionals representing various work roles. Our results revealed that the following qualities contribute to professionals' trust in AI as a colleague: a visual presence reflective of coworkers, engagement in feedback loop and team processes through human communication, and the ability for self-development. These findings contribute to the CSCW community by advancing the current understanding of human-AI teaming and informing the design of trustworthy AI agents into the workplace.",,第1页.xls
56,HUMAN-CENTRIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND CHALLENGES FOR ENABLING HUMAN-AI INTERACTION IN ENGINEERING DESIGN: AN INTERVIEW STUDY,2021,"AI technologies are enabling the development of not only active tools that provide decision-support, but also interactive tools that seek human input and feedback. As interactive tools facilitate human-AI interaction, their design needs to be informed by human-centric requirements, that is, the needs of the users of such tools. In the context of engineering design, there is a gap in our understanding of designing intelligent tools that facilitate human-AI interaction. To fill this gap, the research question of this study is, What are the human-centric design requirements for the design of AI agents to enable human-AI interaction in engineering design contexts? To answer this question, we conducted an interview study with faculty members in engineering design. The faculty predominantly discussed engineers, designers, and engineering design students as the potential stakeholders who would directly benefit from human-AI interaction. For such stakeholders, we identify several human-centric design requirements and challenges in designing AI tools that facilitate human-AI interaction in engineering design. We find that the requirements focused on the need to understand the stakeholders' cognition and the engineering design contexts. The results of our study point to the need for the theory of mind in AI agents to enable them to infer stakeholder preferences while engaging in engineering design activities.",,第1页.xls
57,Capturing Humans' Mental Models of AI: An Item Response Theory Approach,2023,"Improving our understanding of how humans perceive AI team-mates is an important foundation for our general understanding of human-AI teams. Extending relevant work from cognitive science, we propose a framework based on item response theory for modeling these perceptions. We apply this framework to real-world experiments, in which each participant works alongside another person or an AI agent in a question-answering setting, repeatedly assessing their teammate's performance. Using this experimental data, we demonstrate the use of our framework for testing research questions about people's perceptions of both AI agents and other people. We contrast mental models of AI teammates with those of human teammates as we characterize the dimensionality of these mental models, their development over time, and the influence of the participants' own self-perception. Our results indicate that people expect AI agents' performance to be significantly better on average than the performance of other humans, with less variation across different types of problems. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for human-AI interaction.",,第1页.xls

Of particular interest is shared control collaboration, where actions taken by the team depend on the blended combination of inputs from all team entities. We conducted an experiment where participants played a game and maneuvered a spacecraft while working in concert with an AI agent and simultaneously performing a secondary task. The experiment results (i) show different patterns of interactions across user interface designs, agent capabilities, and participants' game experience, (ii) underscore the importance of providing information about the shared control collaborative task to humans who are working with a less-capable agent, and (iii) imply the potential of real-time communication about agent's state to achieve better teamwork.

60,The search for AI value: The role of complexity in human-AI engagement in the financial industry,2024,"The banking industry is infusing AI systems into service encounters while dissolving some traditional services. This study aims to empirically test an exploratory framework to identify how human-AI interactions differ when engaged in basic or advanced virtual agent usage contexts. A conceptual framework was developed to examine consumer perceptions of basic and advanced virtual agent usage intentions. Five independent variables of trust in AI, perceived security in AI, perceived AI expertise, comfort in using AI technologies, and need for social presence were explored. Data was collected from 322 respondents and analyzed using multivariate regression. The findings suggest that consumers do not perceive service encounters with virtual agents from a one size fits all approach. Consumers perceive different value-in-use perceptions based on the complexity of the usage contexts. Our results suggest that success in advanced virtual agent encounters may require social presence for robust human-AI interaction. Additionally, this study extends the digital servitization and service robot acceptance model (sRAM) literature by evaluating consumer value-in-use perceptions with empirical evidence.

61,"A Two-Dimensional Explanation Framework to Classify AI as Incomprehensible, Interpretable, or Understandable",2021,"Because of recent and rapid developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), humans and AI-systems increasingly work together in human-agent teams. However, in order to effectively leverage the capabilities of both, AI-systems need to be understandable to their human teammates. The branch of eXplainable AI (XAI) aspires to make AI-systems more understandable to humans, potentially improving human-agent teamwork. Unfortunately, XAI literature suffers from a lack of agreement regarding the definitions of and relations between the four key XAI-concepts: transparency, interpretability, explainability, and understand-ability. Inspired by both XAI and social sciences literature, we present a two-dimensional framework that defines and relates these concepts in a concise and coherent way, yielding a classification of three types of AIsystems: incomprehensible, interpretable, and understandable. We also discuss how the established relationships can be used to guide future research into XAI, and how the framework could be used during the development of AI-systems as part of human-AI teams.",,第1页.xls
62,Human-AI Collaboration in a Cooperative Game Setting: Measuring Social Perception and Outcomes,2020,"Human-AI interaction is pervasive across many areas of our day to day lives. In this paper, we investigate human-AI collaboration in the context of a collaborative AI-driven word association game with partially observable information. In our experiments, we test various dimensions of subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, creativity and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human. We also test subjective social perceptions of participants towards their partners when participants are presented with a variety of confidence levels. We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=164) of this collaborative game. Our results show that when participants believe their partners were human, they found their partners to be more likeable, intelligent, creative and having more rapport and use more positive words to describe their partner's attributes than when they believed they were interacting with an AI partner. We also found no differences in game outcome including win rate and turns to completion. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss AI agent transparency, include design implications for tools incorporating or supporting human-AI collaboration, and lay out directions for future research. Our findings lead to implications for other forms of human-AI interaction and communication.",,第1页.xls

64,Human-AI interaction in remanufacturing: exploring shop floor workers' behavioural patterns within a specific human-AI system,2023,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly discussed as an innovation enabler for the enhancement of circular economy (CE) approaches in industries. The further deployment of intelligent technologies is considered to be very promising particularly in remanufacturing, which can be regarded as an implementation approach of CE at a firm level. AI's potential to contribute to advancements in remanufacturing can be traced back to these modern technologies' extended capacities of supporting and assisting humans during rather manual processes which are regarded as more common in remanufacturing than in traditional linear production. As a result, we argue that in future application scenarios, humans are going to interact more often with AI agents who may direct and assist humans' behaviour and decision-making processes. We assume that a better understanding of the specific dynamics and novel aspects of these kind of newly emerging human-AI systems is a key prerequisite for sustainable process innovation, particularly in remanufacturing organisations. However, empirical-based contributions about humans' behavioural changes in interaction with AI agents have so far been rather rare and limited, especially in the field of remanufacturing and CE. In this article, we seek to contribute to this gap in research by exploring the interaction between shop floor workers and an AI agent based on a case study research approach at a plant of a German automotive supplier that is remanufacturing used parts. We conducted semi-structured interviews among the shop floor workers who are involved in a joint decision-making task with an AI agent. We interpret the findings of our qualitative data in the light of related research in the field of AI in CE, AI implementation in organisation and human-AI interaction literature. In summary, our analysis reveals 13 behavioural patterns that shop floor workers reported on referring to their interaction with the AI agent. The behavioural patterns are systemised into a cognitive, emotional and social dimension of a competence framework. These findings shall contribute to a more specific understanding about how humans interact with AI agents at work, while considering the specific context variables of the interaction paradigm and the AI agent's role during joint decision-making in a human-AI system. Implications for literature in the field of human-AI interaction as well as AI implementation in organisations with a particular focus on CE are discussed.",,第1页.xls
65,With great power comes great responsibility: inquiry into the social roles and the power dynamics in human-AI interactions,2022,"As machines are becoming more interactive, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, the importance of interactions between humans and AI increases as a new type of communication. However, unlike most studies have examined the influence of AI on individuals, fewer studies about how human-AI interactions will impact society have been conducted. It should be acknowledged that we attribute social roles to AI when assigning social tasks, and there are power dynamics within an interaction between humans and AI because of it. Also, we should ask whether the current society is ready for AI to take responsibility for its actions. Finally, limitations on existing human-machine communication (HMC) studies, an unclear definition of AI as an interlocutor and a lack of theoretical frameworks, were pointed out with suggestions. It is expected that considering a machine's social roles and powers in human-AI interactions will broaden the theoretical realm of HMC.",,第1页.xls
66,Personal Relationships and Human-AI Interactions: A Bonhoefferian Christian Philosophical Reflection on AI Errors,2021,"In Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Christian philosophy, the personal relationship between God and human beings and that between human beings themselves cannot be achieved by intellectual cognition. Rather, all personal relationships occur when one sincerely affirms the Other’s transcendence over the self’s consciousness or spirit. If we explore the core features of human-AI interactions in recent days following Bonhoeffer’s view, we might inevitably focus on their nonrelational and nonethical natures. Human-AI interactions by means of digital objectification are entirely cognitive, and therefore they are fundamentally different from Bonhoeffer’s personal relationships. This might create the possibility for ethically problematic errors of artificial agents. I believe that only a groundbreaking paradigm shift in AI development will help us solve the nonethicality problems in human-AI interactions that bring about certain types of AI errors.",,第1页.xls
67,"Deconstructing Human-AI Collaboration: Agency, Interaction, and Adaptation",2024,"As full AI-based automation remains out of reach in most real-world applications, the focus has instead shifted to leveraging the strengths of both human and AI agents, creating effective collaborative systems. The rapid advances in this area have yielded increasingly more complex systems and frameworks, while the nuance of their characterization has gotten more vague. Similarly, the existing conceptual models no longer capture the elaborate processes of these systems nor describe the entire scope of their collaboration paradigms. In this paper, we propose a new unified set of dimensions through which to analyze and describe human-AI systems. Our conceptual model is centered around three high-level aspects - agency, interaction, and adaptation - and is developed through a multi-step process. Firstly, an initial design space is proposed by surveying the literature and consolidating existing definitions and conceptual frameworks. Secondly, this model is iteratively refined and validated by conducting semi-structured interviews with nine researchers in this field. Lastly, to illustrate the applicability of our design space, we utilize it to provide a structured description of selected human-AI systems.",,第1页.xls
68,On the Utility of Accounting for Human Beliefs about AI Behavior in Human-AI Collaboration,2024,"To enable effective human-AI collaboration, merely optimizing AI performance while ignoring humans is not sufficient. Recent research has demonstrated that designing AI agents to account for human behavior leads to improved performance in human-AI collaboration. However, a limitation of most existing approaches is their assumption that human behavior is static, irrespective of AI behavior. In reality, humans may adjust their action plans based on their observations of AI behavior. In this paper, we address this limitation by enabling a collaborative AI agent to consider the beliefs of its human partner, i.e., what the human partner thinks the AI agent is doing, and design its action plan to facilitate easier collaboration with its human partner. Specifically, we developed a model of human beliefs that accounts for how humans reason about the behavior of their AI partners. Based on this belief model, we then developed an AI agent that considers both human behavior and human beliefs in devising its strategy for working with humans. Through extensive real-world human-subject experiments, we demonstrated that our belief model more accurately predicts humans' beliefs about AI behavior. Moreover, we showed that our design of AI agents that accounts for human beliefs enhances performance in human-AI collaboration.",,第1页.xls
69,Design Principles for Interactive and Reflective Journaling with AI,2023,"Designing for reflection and journaling have been prominent research areas in HCI and Interaction Design. However, designing for the experience of journaling that is supported by conversations with AI-Conversational Agent (CA)-to foster reflection seems to be a relatively unexplored area. Furthermore, while there are an abundant number of general guidelines and design principles for designing human-AI interactions, a set of guidelines for designing an interactive and reflective journaling experience with AI is lacking. This paper is a first attempt to address that need. We present the result of a qualitative user study on interactive and reflective journaling. We were interested in attending to our participants' experiences and finding out their needs regarding the interactive journaling experience with CA. The user needs then were translated to design requirements and thereafter to themes or design principles. Some of our findings suggest that one of the important factors in journaling is the personal aesthetics of writing, by using carefully selected personal tools, specific materiality and interactions. Further, the flow of writing is considered sacred, hence it is almost like an untouchable, reflective ritualistic flow. Reflecting on the findings, we believe the outcome of this study can create opportunities for designing for human-AI interactions that are generative and reflective for activities that require such qualities, such as journaling or creativity.",,第1页.xls
70,Six Challenges for Human-AI Co-learning,2019,"The increasing use of ever-smarter AI-technology is changing the way individuals and teams learn and perform their tasks. In hybrid teams, people collaborate with artificially intelligent partners. To utilize the different strengths and weaknesses of human and artificial intelligence, a hybrid team should be designed upon the principles that foster successful human-machine learning and cooperation. The implementation of the identified principles sets a number of challenges. Machine agents should, just like humans, have mental models that contain information about the task context, their own role (self-awareness), and the role of others (theory of mind). Furthermore, agents should be able to express and clarify their mental states to partners. In this paper we identify six challenges for humans and machines to collaborate in an adaptive, dynamic and personalized fashion. Implications for research are discussed.",,第1页.xls
71,The Impact of Gender and Personality in Human-AI Teaming: The Case of Collaborative Question Answering,2023,"This paper discusses the results of an exploratory study aimed at investigating the impact of conversational agents (CAs) and specifically their agential characteristics on collaborative decision-making processes. The study involved 29 participants divided into 8 small teams engaged in a question-and-answer trivia-style game with the support of a text-based CA, characterized by two independent binary variables: personality (gentle and cooperative vs blunt and uncooperative) and gender (female vs male). A semi-structured group interview was conducted at the end of the experimental sessions to investigate the perceived utility and level of satisfaction with the CAs. Our results show that when users interact with a gentle and cooperative CA, their user satisfaction is higher. Furthermore, female CAs are perceived as more useful and satisfying to interact with than male CAs. We show that group performance improves through interaction with the CAs, confirming that a stereotype favoring the female with a gentle and cooperative personality combination exists in regard to perceived satisfaction, even though this does not lead to greater perceived utility. Our study extends the current debate about the possible correlation between CA characteristics and human acceptance and suggests future research to investigate the role of gender bias and related biases in human-AI teaming.",,第1页.xls
72,Team up with AI or Human? Investigating Candidates' Self-Categorization as Fluidity and Ingroup-Serving Attribution When Judged by a Human-AI Hybrid Jury,2024,"As artificial intelligence (AI) judges are increasingly pervasive in decision-making, it is important to investigate candidates' reactions to decisions made by human-AI hybrid juries. This study investigates candidates' attribution of credit for success and blame for failure to the three agents in question: a human judge, an algorithmic judge, and the candidate oneself. An experiment with 3 (jury type: human-dominated, algorithm-dominated, vs. equally dominated) x 2 (decision outcome: positive vs. negative) between-subjects factorial design was conducted, with 346 valid responses. Our findings demonstrate a partial ingroup-serving attribution dependent on the outcome favorability and a significant effect of relative power status within the human-AI hybrid jury on grouping and attribution. This study reflects the fluidity of identity and self-categorization of human users when facing AI and other humans. We propose that people take a utility-oriented glance at AI in multi-agent decision-making situations.",,第1页.xls
73,"Can We Build it? Yes, We Can! Development Procedure of High-Fidelity Simulation Environments for Human-Agent Teams",2023,"This paper presents a bottom-up approach to designing and developing a high-fidelity simulation environment that fosters human acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) as teammates by refining their mental models of appropriate teamwork expectations. Our process begins by first identifying an appropriate contextual situation that warrants humans teaming with AI as opposed to other team-based configurations. Those criteria are based on the delegation of roles appropriate to the established strengths of humans/AI, as well as the interdependence created between those roles to accentuate the expectations of teammate behavior. Next, qualitative interviews should be conducted with diverse subject matter experts to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the environmental attributes through various perspectives. Once analyzed using thematic analysis, themes present themselves as design recommendations on how to create a high-fidelity simulation environment that nurtures human-agent team collaboration.",,第1页.xls
74,Locating Responsibility in the Future of Human-AI Interactions,2024,"Whether we, as end-users of technology, are aware of it or not, our societies are becoming increasingly entangled in a complex network of interactions with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This goes beyond what is often called 'Human-AI collaboration', involving the broader socio-political systems supporting these technologies [1]. Faced with these complex interactions, society grapples with the timeless question: where does responsibility lie for the consequences or results produced by AI systems or applications, whether they are successful or not? Is it with the human operator, AI developer, user, or the AI agent itself? In the case of failure, AI cannot be held accountable, as such software systems are not yet recognized as separate legal entities [2].",,第1页.xls
75,Trust in Human-AI Interaction: Review of Empirical Research on Trust in AI-Powered Smart Home Ecosystems,2024,"The growing socio-technical influence of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing in various dimensions of our daily lives. The monitoring and decision-making role of smart home AI agents could go beyond simple operations, and a lack of users' trust could lead to the underuse or misuse of their capabilities. As such, lying at the intersection of trust in human-AI interactions and smart home ecosystems, this paper attempts to explore the driving factors of building trustworthy AI-powered smart home ecosystems. To this end, through a systematic literature review, we have identified the characteristics of human-AI trust in intelligent environments, factors that can influence users' trust in AI, features that can be implemented to improve users' trust, and challenges and opportunities that need to be considered. The findings can help develop a pathway for building long-term users' trust in AI-powered smart homes for integrated human-AI interactions.",,第1页.xls
76,How humans obtain information from AI: Categorizing user messages in human-AI collaborative conversations,2022,"Although there is an increasingly number of research about the design and use of conversational agents, it is still difficult for conversational agents to completely replace human service. Therefore, more and more companies have adopted human-AI collaborative systems to deliver customer service. It is important to understand how people obtain information from human-AI collaborative conversations. While the existing work relies on self-reported methods to elicit qualitative feedback from users, we have concluded a categorization system for user messages in human-AI collaborative conversations after a thorough examination of a real-world customer service log, which could objectively reflect the user's information needs. We categorize user messages into five categories and 15 specific types related to three high-level intentions. Two annotators independently classified the same set of 1,478 user messages from 300 conversations and reached a moderate consistency. We summarize and report the characteristics of different message types and compare their usage in sessions with only human, AI, or both representatives. Our results show that different message types vary significantly in usage frequency, length, and text similarities with other messages in a session. Also, the frequency of using different message types in our dataset seems consistent over sessions with different types of representatives. But we also observed some significant differences in a few specific message types across the sessions with different representatives. Our results are used to suggest some areas for improvement and future work in human-AI collaborative conversational systems.",,第1页.xls
77,Sand-in-the-loop: Investigating embodied co-creation for shared understandings of generative AI,2023,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in creative practices have grown tremendously over the past few years. However, these generative AI applications lack clarity on how they work and operate for their users. Revealing how generative AI tools work enables designers to understand these tools' limitations and capabilities. We developed a tangible interface with sand as a medium for human-AI co-creation, Sand Playground. It extends the work in human-AI drawing practices beyond two-dimensional digital surfaces. Sand playground has three co-drawing modes, artistic mimicry, zen garden and doodling. We conducted a user study with ten designers. One of our fndings is that the interface enabled users to predict the AI agent's actions. Our research introduces novel insights into the role of tangible interactions and physical interfaces in generative AI literacy and explainability in design tools.",,第1页.xls
78,AI as a Child of Mother Earth: Regrounding Human-AI Interaction in Ecological Thinking,2024,"The anthropocentric cultural idea that humans are active agents exerting control over their environments has been largely normalized and inscribed in practices, policies, and products of contemporary industrialized societies. This view underlies a human-ecology relationship based on resource and knowledge extraction. To create a more sustainable and equitable future, it is essential to consider alternative cultural ideas rooted in ecological thinking. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness between humans and more-than-human worlds. We propose a path to reshape the human-ecology relationship by advocating for alternative human-AI interactions. In this paper, we undertake a critical comparison between anthropocentrism and ecological thinking, using storytelling to illustrate various human-AI interactions that embody ecological thinking. We also delineate a set of design principles aimed at guiding AI developments toward fostering a more caring human-ecology relationship.",,第1页.xls
79,Are We Asking the Right Questions?: Designing for Community Stakeholders' Interactions with AI in Policing,2024,"Research into recidivism risk prediction in the criminal justice system has garnered significant attention from HCI, critical algorithm studies, and the emerging field of human-AI decision-making. This study focuses on algorithmic crime mapping, a prevalent yet underexplored form of algorithmic decision support (ADS) in this context. We conducted experiments and follow-up interviews with 60 participants, including community members, technical experts, and law enforcement agents (LEAs), to explore how lived experiences, technical knowledge, and domain expertise shape interactions with the ADS, impacting human-AI decision-making. Surprisingly, we found that domain experts (LEAs) often exhibited anchoring bias, readily accepting and engaging with the first crime map presented to them. Conversely, community members and technical experts were more inclined to engage with the tool, adjust controls, and generate different maps. Our findings highlight that all three stakeholders were able to provide critical feedback regarding AI design and use - community members questioned the core motivation of the tool, technical experts drew attention to the elastic nature of data science practice, and LEAs suggested redesign pathways such that the tool could complement their domain expertise.",,第1页.xls

81,Designing Transparency for Effective Human-AI Collaboration,2022,"The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing quickly, and systems can increasingly perform a multitude of tasks that previously required human intelligence. Information systems can facilitate collaboration between humans and AI systems such that their individual capabilities complement each other. However, there is a lack of consolidated design guidelines for information systems facilitating the collaboration between humans and AI systems. This work examines how agent transparency affects trust and task outcomes in the context of human-AI collaboration. Drawing on the 3-Gap framework, we study agent transparency as a means to reduce the information asymmetry between humans and the AI. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we formulate testable propositions, derive design requirements, and synthesize design principles. We instantiate two design principles as design features of an information system utilized in the hospitality industry. Further, we conduct two case studies to evaluate the effects of agent transparency: We find that trust increases when the AI system provides information on its reasoning, while trust decreases when the AI system provides information on sources of uncertainty. Additionally, we observe that agent transparency improves task outcomes as it enhances the accuracy of judgemental forecast adjustments.",,第1页.xls
82,The impact of human-AI collaboration types on consumer evaluation and usage intention: a perspective of responsibility attribution.,2023,"Despite the widespread availability of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services, consumer evaluations and adoption intentions have not met expectations. Existing research mainly focuses on AI's instrumental attributes from the consumer perspective, along with negative impacts of AI failures on evaluations and willingness to use. However, research is lacking on AI as a collaborative agent, investigating the impact of human-AI collaboration on AI acceptance under different outcome expectations. This study examines the interactive effects of human-AI collaboration types (AI-dominant vs. AI-assisted) and outcome expectations (positive vs. negative) on AI product evaluations and usage willingness, along with the underlying mechanisms, from a human-AI relationship perspective. It also investigates the moderating role of algorithm transparency in these effects. Using three online experiments with analysis of variance and bootstrap methods, the study validates these interactive mechanisms, revealing the mediating role of attribution and moderating role of algorithm transparency. Experiment 1 confirms the interactive effects of human-AI collaboration types and outcome expectations on consumer evaluations and usage willingness. Under positive outcome expectations, consumers evaluate and express willingness to use AI-dominant intelligent vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities higher than those with emergency evasion capabilities (AI-assisted). However, under negative outcome expectations, consumers rate autonomous driving capabilities lower compared to emergency evasion capabilities. Experiment 2 examines the mediating role of attribution through ChatGPT's dominant or assisting role under different outcome expectations. Experiment 3 uses a clinical decision-making system to study algorithm transparency's moderating role, showing higher transparency improves evaluations and willingness to use AI products and services under negative outcome expectations. Theoretically, this study advances consumer behavior research by exploring the human-AI relationship within artificial intelligence, enhancing understanding of consumer acceptance variations. Practically, it offers insights for better integrating AI products and services into the market.",,第1页.xls
83,Human-AI Learning Performance in Multi-Armed Bandits,2019,"People frequently face challenging decision-making problems in which outcomes are uncertain or unknown. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms exist that can outperform humans at learning such tasks. Thus, there is an opportunity for AI agents to assist people in learning these tasks more effectively. In this work, we use a multi-armed bandit as a controlled setting in which to explore this direction. We pair humans with a selection of agents and observe how well each human-agent team performs. We find that team performance can beat both human and agent performance in isolation. Interestingly, we also find that an agent's performance in isolation does not necessarily correlate with the human-agent team's performance. A drop in agent performance can lead to a disproportionately large drop in team performance, or in some set tings can even improve team performance. Pairing a human with an agent that performs slightly better than them can make them perform much better, while pairing them with an agent that performs the same can make them them perform much worse. Further, our results suggest that people have different exploration strategies and might perform better with agents that match their strategy. Overall, optimizing human-agent team performance requires going beyond optimizing agent performance, to understanding how the agent's suggestions will influence human decision-making.",,第1页.xls
84,Which Biases and Reasoning Pitfalls Do Explanations Trigger? Decomposing Communication Processes in Human-AI Interaction,2022,"Collaborative human-AI problem-solving and decision making rely on effective communications between both agents. Such communication processes comprise explanations and interactions between a sender and a receiver. Investigating these dynamics is crucial to avoid miscommunication problems. Hence, in this article, we propose a communication dynamics model, examining the impact of the sender's explanation intention and strategy on the receiver's perception of explanation effects. We further present potential biases and reasoning pitfalls with the aim of contributing to the design of hybrid intelligence systems. Finally, we propose six desiderata for human-centered explainable AI and discuss future research opportunities.",,第1页.xls
85,Conceptual Knowledge Modelling for Human-AI Teaming in Data-Frugal Industrial Environments,2024,"When AI interacts with humans in complex environments, such as aerospace manufacturing, safety of operation is of paramount importance. Trustworthiness of AI needs to be ensured through, among other things, explainability of its behaviour and rationale, which is typically a challenge for current deep neural network-based systems.We tackle the knowledge comprehensibility aspect of intrinsic explainability by suggesting a concept-level environment awareness model combining various complementary knowledge sources - statistical learning using dedicated property detectors through publicly available software, and crowd-sourced common-sense knowledge graphs. Our approach also addresses the issue of data-frugal learning, typical for environments with highly specific purpose-built artefacts. We adopt Gardenfors's Conceptual Spaces as a cognitively-motivated knowledge representation framework and apply our typicality quantification model in a use case on interpretable classification of manufacturing artefacts.",,第1页.xls

87,Effects of Communication Directionality and AI Agent Differences in Human-AI Interaction,2021,"In Human-AI collaborative settings that are inherently interactive, direction of communication plays a role in how users perceive their AI partners. In an AI-driven cooperative game with partially observable information, players (be it the AI or the human player) require their actions to be interpreted accurately by the other player to yield a successful outcome. In this paper, we investigate social perceptions of AI agents with various directions of communication in a cooperative game setting. We measure subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human and the nature of the communication (responsiveness and leading roles). We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=199) of this collaborative game and find significant differences in gameplay outcome and social perception across different AI agents, different directions of communication and when the agent is perceived to be an AI/Human. We find that the bias against the AI that has been demonstrated in prior studies varies with the direction of the communication and with the AI agent.",,第1页.xls
88,Estimating the Impact of Humanizing AI Assistants,2023,"More and more product designers are adopting anthropomorphic design strategies to facilitate the widespread use of AI assistants. However, existing studies show that the ideal boundary of the degree of anthropomorphism is still unclear. Therefore, we design two scenario experimental studies to explore the influence of different degrees of anthropomorphism on human-AI interaction quality. We also consider the difference in impact between two usage contexts: the hedonic and utilitarian contexts. The results show that different degrees of anthropomorphism significantly affect human-AI interaction quality in different ways; when AI assistants have a medium-level degree of anthropomorphism, the positive effect is pronounced. Furthermore, the positive relationship between anthropomorphism and human-AI interaction quality is more robust in the hedonic usage context; this positive effect disappears in the utilitarian usage context. We expect this study to provide practical guidance for AI product designers to achieve their products' long-term feasibility and sustainability.",,第1页.xls
89,Human-AI Collaboration for Remote Sighted Assistance: Perspectives from the LLM Era,2024,"Remote sighted assistance (RSA) has emerged as a conversational technology aiding people with visual impairments (VI) through real-time video chat communication with sighted agents. We conducted a literature review and interviewed 12 RSA users to understand the technical and navigational challenges faced by both agents and users. The technical challenges were categorized into four groups: agents' difficulties in orienting and localizing users, acquiring and interpreting users' surroundings and obstacles, delivering information specific to user situations, and coping with poor network connections. We also presented 15 real-world navigational challenges, including 8 outdoor and 7 indoor scenarios. Given the spatial and visual nature of these challenges, we identified relevant computer vision problems that could potentially provide solutions. We then formulated 10 emerging problems that neither human agents nor computer vision can fully address alone. For each emerging problem, we discussed solutions grounded in human-AI collaboration. Additionally, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), we outlined how RSA can integrate with LLMs within a human-AI collaborative framework, envisioning the future of visual prosthetics.",,第1页.xls
90,AI Agents Learning Human Decision Policies for Collaborative Situation Assessment in NORAD C2 Operations,2024,"The modernization of Command and Control (C2) for North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD) entails supporting operators with trustworthy AI-based solutions that complement, rather than replace, human abilities. New forms of threats requires more than ever the ability to quickly derive actionable situational awareness from a set of heterogeneous sensors. In this paper, we investigate the use of Human-Automation Teaming (HAT) for achieving accurate, timely continental surveillance in the context of NORAD critical infrastructure protection. We developed a collaborative AI agent solution with awareness, anticipation and decision capabilities, augmented here with the ability to learn human decision policies for improved collaborative situation assessment. The study employs a simulated threat evaluation task to validate the effectiveness of the augmented AI-agent using a multi-model approach combining seven supervised machine learning algorithms. Results show that the policy capturing method classified threat levels with a predictive accuracy of 95% while considering three different types of targets (UAV, drone swarm, small aircraft). We conclude that integrating the policy capturing capability into a collaborative AI-agent constitutes a key step toward enabling a novel human-AI co-learning process for adjustable human-autonomy teaming.",,第1页.xls
91,Causal Responsibility Attribution for Human-AI Collaboration,2024,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly influence decision-making across various fields, the need to attribute responsibility for undesirable outcomes has become essential, though complicated by the complex interplay between humans and AI. Existing attribution methods based on actual causality and Shapley values tend to disproportionately blame agents who contribute more to an outcome and rely on real-world measures of blameworthiness that may misalign with responsible AI standards. This paper presents a causal framework using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to systematically attribute responsibility in human-AI systems, measuring overall blameworthiness while employing counterfactual reasoning to account for agents' expected epistemic levels. Two case studies illustrate the framework's adaptability in diverse human-AI collaboration scenarios.",,第1页.xls
92,AI-enhanced collective intelligence.,2024,"Current societal challenges exceed the capacity of humans operating either alone or collectively. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives will vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, together, can surpass the collective intelligence of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from complex network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising cognition, physical, and information layers. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. We explore how agents' diversity and interactions influence the system's collective intelligence and analyze real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by considering potential challenges and future developments in this field.",,第1页.xls
93,COHUMAIN: Building the Socio-Cognitive Architecture of Collective Human-Machine Intelligence.,2023,"In recent years, we have experienced rapid development of advanced technology, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI), intended to interact with and augment the abilities of humans in practically every area of life. With the rapid growth of new capabilities, such as those enabled by generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT), AI is increasingly at the center of human communication and collaboration, resulting in a growing recognition of the need to understand how humans and AI can integrate their inputs in collaborative teams. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding how human-AI collective intelligence will emerge and what the barriers might be. Truly integrated collaboration between humans and intelligent agents may result in a different way of working that looks nothing like what we know now, and it is important to keep the essential goal of human societal well-being and prosperity a priority. In this special issue, we begin to scope out the underpinnings of a socio-cognitive architecture for Collective HUman-MAchine INtelligence (COHUMAIN), which is the study of the capability of an integrated human and machine (i.e., intelligent technology) system to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. This topic consists of nine papers including a description of the conceptual foundation for a socio-cognitive architecture for COHUMAIN, empirical tests of some aspects of this architecture, research on proposed representations of intelligent agents that can jointly interact with humans, empirical tests of human-human and human-machine interactions, and philosophical and ethical issues to consider as we develop these systems.",,第1页.xls
94,Bringing Together Ergonomic Concepts and Cognitive Mechanisms for Human-AI Agents Cooperation,2023,"The deployment of artificial intelligence from experimental settings to concrete applications implies to consider the social aspects of the environment and consequently to conceive the interaction between humans and computers endowed with the aim of being partners in action. This article proposes a review of the research initiatives regarding human-artificial agents interaction, including eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and HRI/HCI. We argue that even if vocabulary and approaches are different, the concepts converge on the necessity for the artificial agents to provide an accurate mental model of their behavior to the humans they are interacting with. This has different implications depending on whether we consider a tool/user interaction or a cooperation interaction-which is far less documented despite being at the heart of the future concepts of autonomous vehicles. From this observation, the article uses the cognitive science corpus on joint-action to raise finer cognitive mechanisms proved to be essential for human joint-action which could be considered as cognitive requirements for future artificial agents, including shared task representation and mentalization. Finally, interactions content hypotheses are arisen to satisfy the identified mechanisms, including the ability for the artificial agent to elicit its intentions and to trigger mentalization toward them from the human cooperators.",,第1页.xls
95,(Non -)Interacting with Conversational Agents: Perceptions and Motivations of Using Chatbots and Voice Assistants,2020,"Conversational agents (CAs) such as Ski, Alexa, and Google Assistant are increasingly penetrating everyday life. From a Human -Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective, designing CAs that appropriately support the way they are used within daily life is still challenging. While initial design guidelines for human -AI interaction exist, we still know little about how users actually perceive CAs within their daily lives and what aspects motivate their usage of such tools. Within our research, we therefore conducted an interview study with 29 participants to uncover daily positive and negative experiences with CAs. By revealing how users currently perceive CAs, we identify quality criteria that could inform their future design. By evaluating these criteria with respect to existing research discourses about user experience (UX) guidelines for CAs, we contribute to the field by extending these guidelines from an end-user's perspective.",,第1页.xls

In the first study, I explore what user burdens occur when deleting unused apps. To do so, I have conducted in-depth interviews, designed questionnaires, and performed scenario-based experiments. In my second study, I designed and developed a conversational agent that documents and reports cases of sexual assault survivors to the police on behalf of the survivors. To discover survivors' burdens and find solutions to mitigate them, I conducted in-depth interviews and participatory design sessions with sexual assault survivors, as well as diverse stakeholders (e.g., police officers, counselors). In my third study, I investigated why employees resist algorithmic evaluations in workplaces and how to mitigate these burdens. The goal of participating in this doctoral consortium is to share the three lines of research for my thesis with researchers and professors and gain diverse ideas and feedback from the HCI community to better synthesize my works.",,第1页.xls

A drop in agent performance can lead to a disproportionately large drop in team performance, or in some settings can even improve team performance. Pairing a human with an agent that performs slightly better than them can make them perform much better, while pairing them with an agent that performs the same can make them them perform much worse. Further, our results suggest that people have different exploration strategies and might perform better with agents that match their strategy. Overall, optimizing human-agent team performance requires going beyond optimizing agent performance, to understanding how the agent's suggestions will influence human decision-making.",,第1页.xls
98,Supporting Social Interactions In Human-Ai Teams: Profiling Human Teammates From Sparse Data,2021,"Artificial intelligence has been developed to perform all manner of tasks but has not gained capabilities to support social cognition. We suggest that teams comprised of both humans and artificially intelligent agents cannot achieve optimal team performance unless all teammates have the capacity to employ social-cognitive mechanisms. These form the foundation for generating inferences about their counterparts and enable execution of informed, appropriate behaviors. Social intelligence and its utilization are known to be vital components of human-human teaming processes due to their importance in guiding the recognition, interpretation, and use of the signals that humans naturally use to shape their exchanges. Although modern sensors and algorithms could allow AI to observe most social cues, signals, and other indicators, the approximation of human-to-human social interaction -based upon aggregation and modeling of such cues is currently beyond the capacity of potential AI teammates. Partially, this is because humans are notoriously variable. We describe an approach for measuring social-cognitive features to produce the raw information needed to create human agent profiles that can be operated upon by artificial intelligences.",,第1页.xls
99,"Deconstructing Human-AI Collaboration: Agency, Interaction, and Adaptation",2024,"As full AI-based automation remains out of reach in most real-world applications, the focus has instead shifted to leveraging the strengths of both human and AI agents, creating effective collaborative systems. The rapid advances in this area have yielded increasingly more complex systems and frameworks, while the nuance of their characterization has gotten more vague. Similarly, the existing conceptual models no longer capture the elaborate processes of these systems nor describe the entire scope of their collaboration paradigms. In this paper, we propose a new unified set of dimensions through which to analyze and describe human-AI systems. Our conceptual model is centered around three high-level aspects - agency, interaction, and adaptation - and is developed through a multi-step process. Firstly, an initial design space is proposed by surveying the literature and consolidating existing definitions and conceptual frameworks. Secondly, this model is iteratively refined and validated by conducting semi-structured interviews with nine researchers in this field. Lastly, to illustrate the applicability of our design space, we utilize it to provide a structured description of selected human-AI systems.",,第1页.xls
100,ADVISE: Accelerating the Creation of Evidence Syntheses for Global Development Using Natural Language Processing-Supported Human-Artificial Intelligence Collaboration,2024,"When designing evidence-based policies and programs, decision-makers must distill key information from a vast and rapidly growing literature base. Identifying relevant literature from raw search results is time and resource intensive, and is often done by manual screening. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI) agent based on a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and incorporate it into a human team designing an evidence synthesis product for global development. We explore the effectiveness of the human-AI hybrid team in accelerating the evidence synthesis process. To further improve team efficiency, we enhance the human-AI hybrid team through active learning (AL). Specifically, we explore different sampling strategies, including random sampling, least confidence (LC) sampling, and highest priority (HP) sampling, to study their influence on the collaborative screening process. Results show that incorporating the BERT-based AI agent into the human team can reduce the human screening effort, i.e., the number of documents that humans need to screen, by 68.5% compared to the case of no AI assistance and by 16.8% compared to the industry-standard case of using a frequency-based language model and support vector machine-based classifier for identifying 80% of all relevant documents. When we apply the HP sampling strategy, the human screening effort can be reduced even more: by 78.3% for identifying 80% of all relevant documents compared to no AI assistance. We apply the AL-enhanced human-AI hybrid teaming workflow in the design process of three evidence gap maps for U.S. Agency for International Development and find it to be highly effective. These findings demonstrate how AI can accelerate the development of evidence synthesis products and promote timely evidence-based decision-making in global development.",,第1页.xls
101,Understanding Nonlinear Collaboration between Human and AI Agents: A Co-design Framework for Creative Design,2024,"Creative design is a nonlinear process where designers generate diverse ideas in the pursuit of an open-ended goal and converge towards consensus through iterative remixing. In contrast, AI-powered design tools often employ a linear sequence of incremental and precise instructions to approximate design objectives. Such operations violate customary creative design practices and thus hinder AI agents' ability to complete creative design tasks. To explore better human-AI co-design tools, we first summarize human designers' practices through a formative study with 12 design experts. Taking graphic design as a representative scenario, we formulate a nonlinear human-AI co-design framework and develop a proof-of-concept prototype, OptiMuse. We evaluate OptiMuse and validate the nonlinear framework through a comparative study. We notice a subconscious change in people's attitudes towards AI agents, shifting from perceiving them as mere executors to regarding them as opinionated colleagues. This shift effectively fostered the exploration and reflection processes of individual designers.",,第1页.xls
102,Effects of Communication Directionality and AI Agent Differences in Human-AI Interaction,2021,"In Human-AI collaborative settings that are inherently interactive, direction of communication plays a role in how users perceive their AI partners. In an AI-driven cooperative game with partially observable information, players (be it the AI or the human player) require their actions to be interpreted accurately by the other player to yield a successful outcome. In this paper, we investigate social perceptions of AI agents with various directions of communication in a cooperative game setting. We measure subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human and the nature of the communication (responsiveness and leading roles). We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=199) of this collaborative game and find significant differences in gameplay outcome and social perception across different AI agents, different directions of communication and when the agent is perceived to be an AI/Human. We find that the bias against the AI that has been demonstrated in prior studies varies with the direction of the communication and with the AI agent.",,第1页.xls
103,Optimizing risk-averse human-ai hybrid teams,2024,"We anticipate increased instances of humans and AI systems working together in what we refer to as a hybrid team. The increase in collaboration is expected as AI systems gain proficiency and their adoption becomes more widespread. However, their behavior is not error-free, making hybrid teams a very suitable solution. As such, we consider methods for improving performance for these teams of humans and AI systems. For hybrid teams, we will refer to both the humans and AI systems as agents. To improve team performance over that seen for agents operating individually, we propose a manager which learns, through a standard Reinforcement Learning scheme, how to best delegate, over time, the responsibility of taking a decision to any of the agents. We further guide the manager's learning so they also minimize how many changes in delegation are made resulting from undesirable team behavior. We demonstrate the optimality of our manager's performance in several grid environments which include failure states which terminate an episode and should be avoided. We perform our experiments with teams of agents with varying degrees of acceptable risk, in the form of proximity to a failure state, and measure the manager's ability to make effective delegation decisions with respect to its own risk-based constraints, then compare these to the optimal decisions. Our results show our manager can successfully learn desirable delegations which result in team paths near/exactly optimal with respect to path length and number of delegations.",,第1页.xls
104,Human-AI Co-Dancing: Evolving Cultural Heritage through Collaborative Choreography with Generative Virtual Characters,2024,"This research introduces an approach for translating traditional dance knowledge into interactive computational models extending beyond static dance performance recordings. Specifically, this paper presents the concept of Human-AI co-dancing, which involves integrating human dancers with virtual dance partners powered by models derived from dance principles. To demonstrate this concept, the research focuses on the choreographic principles deconstructed from the knowledge of traditional Thai dance. The principles are analyzed and translated into computational procedures that dynamically manipulate the movements of a virtual character by altering animation keyframes and the motions of individual joints in real-time. We developed an interactive system that enables dancers to improvise alongside the virtual agent. The system incorporates voice control functionality, allowing the dancer, choreographer, and even the audience to participate in altering the choreography of the virtual agents by adjusting parameters that represent traditional Thai dance elements. Human-AI rehearsals yielded intriguing artistic results, with hybrid movement aesthetics emerging from the synergy and friction between humans and machines. The resulting dance production, Cyber Subin, demonstrates the potential of combining intangible cultural heritage, intelligent technology, and posthuman choreography to expand artistic expression and preserve traditional wisdom in a contemporary context.",,第1页.xls
105,Task Delegation from AI to Humans: The Impact of AI Transparency on Human Performance,2024,"This study examines the effects of AI transparency in AI-human task delegation. According to the principal-agent theory (PAT), increasing transparency can help address the problem of hidden action. Through a between-subjects experiment with three conditions (AI advantage information, AI function information, vs. no information), we explore the impact of AI transparency on human task performance and consider the mediating effect of human epistemic uncertainty and AI trust. Results show that AI function information enhances accuracy, while AI advantage information encourages more task completion. Epistemic uncertainty fully mediates the relationship between transparency and task performance (both accuracy and image number), while AI trust only mediates the effect on image number. The results have implications for the future work of the design of AI transparency in human-AI collaboration.",,第1页.xls
106,How Should an AI Trust its Human Teammates? Exploring Possible Cues of Artificial Trust,2024,"In teams composed of humans, we use trust in others to make decisions, such as what to do next, who to help and who to ask for help. When a team member is artificial, they should also be able to assess whether a human teammate is trustworthy for a certain task. We see trustworthiness as the combination of (1) whether someone will do a task and (2) whether they can do it. With building beliefs in trustworthiness as an ultimate goal, we explore which internal factors (krypta) of the human may play a role (e.g., ability, benevolence, and integrity) in determining trustworthiness, according to existing literature. Furthermore, we investigate which observable metrics (manifesta) an agent may take into account as cues for the human teammate's krypta in an online 2D grid-world experiment ( n = 54). Results suggest that cues of ability, benevolence and integrity influence trustworthiness. However, we observed that trustworthiness is mainly influenced by human's playing strategy and cost-benefit analysis, which deserves further investigation. This is a first step towards building informed beliefs of human trustworthiness in human-AI teamwork.",,第1页.xls
107,Ascribing consciousness to artificial intelligence: human-AI interaction and its carry-over effects on human-human interaction.,2024,"The question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) can be considered conscious and therefore should be evaluated through a moral lens has surfaced in recent years. In this paper, we argue that whether AI is conscious is less of a concern than the fact that AI can be considered conscious by users during human-AI interaction, because this ascription of consciousness can lead to carry-over effects on human-human interaction. When AI is viewed as conscious like a human, then how people treat AI appears to carry over into how they treat other people due to activating schemas that are congruent to those activated during interactions with humans. In light of this potential, we might consider regulating how we treat AI, or how we build AI to evoke certain kinds of treatment from users, but not because AI is inherently sentient. This argument focuses on humanlike, social actor AI such as chatbots, digital voice assistants, and social robots. In the first part of the paper, we provide evidence for carry-over effects between perceptions of AI consciousness and behavior toward humans through literature on human-computer interaction, human-AI interaction, and the psychology of artificial agents. In the second part of the paper, we detail how the mechanism of schema activation can allow us to test consciousness perception as a driver of carry-over effects between human-AI interaction and human-human interaction. In essence, perceiving AI as conscious like a human, thereby activating congruent mind schemas during interaction, is a driver for behaviors and perceptions of AI that can carry over into how we treat humans. Therefore, the fact that people can ascribe humanlike consciousness to AI is worth considering, and moral protection for AI is also worth considering, regardless of AI's inherent conscious or moral status.",,第1页.xls

109,Outlining the design space of eXplainable swarm (xSwarm): experts perspective [arXiv],2023,"In swarm robotics, agents interact through local roles to solve complex tasks beyond an individual's ability. Even though swarms are capable of carrying out some operations without the need for human intervention, many safety-critical applications still call for human operators to control and monitor the swarm. There are novel challenges to effective Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI) that are only beginning to be addressed. Explainability is one factor that can facilitate effective and trustworthy HSI and improve the overall performance of Human-Swarm team. Explainability was studied across various Human-AI domains, such as Human-Robot Interaction and Human-Centered ML. However, it is still ambiguous whether explanations studied in Human-AI literature would be beneficial in Human-Swarm research and development. Furthermore, the literature lacks foundational research on the prerequisites for explainability requirements in swarm robotics, i.e., what kind of questions an explainable swarm is expected to answer, and what types of explanations a swarm is expected to generate. By surveying 26 swarm experts, we seek to answer these questions and identify challenges experts faced to generate explanations in Human-Swarm environments. Our work contributes insights into defining a new area of research of eXplainable Swarm (xSwarm) which looks at how explainability can be implemented and developed in swarm systems. This paper opens the discussion on xSwarm and paves the way for more research in the field.",,第1页.xls

This work particularly focuses on the potential of AIGC to revolutionize image creation, such as photography and self-expression. We introduce ContextCam, a novel human-AI image co-creation system that integrates context awareness with mainstream AIGC technologies like Stable Diffusion. ContextCam provides user's image creation process with inspiration by extracting relevant contextual data, and leverages Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agents to co-create images with the user.

Participants provided positive feedback on their engagement and enjoyment when using ContextCam, and acknowledged its ability to inspire creativity.",,第1页.xls
112,Human factors considerations for the context-aware design of adaptive autonomous teammates,2024,"Despite the gains in performance that AI can bring to human-AI teams, they also present them with new challenges, such as the decline in human ability to respond to AI failures as the AI becomes more autonomous. This challenge is particularly dangerous in human-AI teams, where the AI holds a unique role in the team's success. Thus, it is imperative that researchers find solutions for designing AI team-mates that consider their human team-mates' needs in their adaptation logic. This study explores adaptive autonomy as a solution to overcoming these challenges. We conducted twelve contextual inquiries with professionals in two teaming contexts in order to understand how human teammate perceptions can be used to determine optimal autonomy levels for AI team-mates. The results of this study will enable the human factors community to develop AI team-mates that can enhance their team's performance while avoiding the potentially devastating impacts of their failures.As AI becomes more autonomous, the human ability to detect and respond to their failures decreases as they become less a part of the AI's decision-making loop. This contextual inquiry study shows how human factors are affected by and should influence the design of adaptive AI team-mates in different teaming contexts.",,第1页.xls

The present research investigates how contributors' metacognition or self-beliefs, combine with others' views of themselves to inform collective team states related to learning about other agents (i.e., transactive memory systems) and forming social attachments with other agents (i.e., collective team identification), both important teamwork states that have implications for team collective intelligence. We test the predictions in a longitudinal study with 78 teams. Additionally, we provide interview data from industry experts in human-artificial intelligence teams. Our findings contribute to an emerging socio-cognitive architecture for COllective HUman-MAchine INtelligence (i.e., COHUMAIN) by articulating its underpinnings in individual and collective cognition and metacognition. Our resulting model has implications for the critical inputs necessary to design and enable a higher level of integration of human and machine teammates.",,第1页.xls
114,Demonstrating Optimized Delegation between AI and Human Agents,2022,"With humans interacting with AI-based systems at an increasing rate, it is necessary to ensure the artificial systems are acting in a manner which reflects understanding of the human. In the case of humans and artificial AI agents operating in the same environment, we note the significance of comprehension and response to the actions or capabilities of a human from an agent's perspective, as well as the possibility to delegate decisions either to humans or to agents, depending on who is deemed more suitable for a given context. Such capabilities will ensure an improved responsiveness and utility of the entire human-AI system. To that end, we investigate the use of cognitively inspired models of behavior to predict the behavior of both human and AI agents. The predicted behavior, and associated performance with respect to a certain goal, is used to delegate control between humans and AI agents through the use of an intermediary entity. As we demonstrate, this allows overcoming potential shortcomings of either humans or agents in the pursuit of a goal.",,第1页.xls
115,Responsible (use of) AI.,2023,"Although there is a rich history of philosophical definitions of ethics when applied to human behavior, applying the same concepts and principles to AI may be fraught with problems. Anthropomorphizing AI to have characteristics such as ethics may promote a dangerous, unrealistic expectation that AI can be trained to have inherent, guaranteed ethical behavior. The authors instead advocate for increased research into the ethical use of AI from initial ideation and design through operational use and sustainment. The authors advocate for five key research areas: (1) education in ethics and core AI concepts for AI developers, leaders, and users, (2) development and use of model cards or datasheets for datasets to provide transparency into the strengths, limits, and potential biases of a trained model, (3) employing human-centered design that seeks to understand human value structures within a task context and enable effective human-machine interaction through intuitive and transparent interfaces, (4) targeted use of run time assurance that monitors and modifies the inputs or outputs of a trained model when necessary to enforce ethical principles such as safety or limiting bias, and (5) developing best practices for the use of a joint human-AI co-creation and training experience to enable a shared mental model and higher performance through potential emergent behavior.",,第1页.xls
116,Studying human-AI collaboration protocols: the case of the Kasparov's law in radiological double reading,2021,"Purpose The integration of Artificial Intelligence into medical practices has recently been advocated for the promise to bring increased efficiency and effectiveness to these practices. Nonetheless, little research has so far been aimed at understanding the best human-AI interaction protocols in collaborative tasks, even in currently more viable settings, like independent double-reading screening tasks. Methods To this aim, we report about a retrospective case-control study, involving 12 board-certified radiologists, in the detection of knee lesions by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, in which we simulated the serial combination of two Deep Learning models with humans in eight double-reading protocols. Inspired by the so-called Kasparov's Laws, we investigate whether the combination of humans and AI models could achieve better performance than AI models alone, and whether weak reader, when supported by fit-for-use interaction protocols, could out-perform stronger readers. Results We discuss two main findings: groups of humans who perform significantly worse than a state-of-the-art AI can significantly outperform it if their judgements are aggregated by majority voting (in concordance with the first part of the Kasparov's law); small ensembles of significantly weaker readers can significantly outperform teams of stronger readers, supported by the same computational tool, when the judgments of the former ones are combined within fit-for-use protocols (in concordance with the second part of the Kasparov's law). Conclusion Our study shows that good interaction protocols can guarantee improved decision performance that easily surpasses the performance of individual agents, even of realistic super-human AI systems. This finding highlights the importance of focusing on how to guarantee better co-operation within human-AI teams, so to enable safer and more human sustainable care practices.",,第1页.xls
117,Owning Mistakes Sincerely: Strategies for Mitigating AI Errors,2022,"Interactive AI systems such as voice assistants are bound to make errors because of imperfect sensing and reasoning. Prior human-AI interaction research has illustrated the importance of various strategies for error mitigation in repairing the perception of an AI following a breakdown in service. These strategies include explanations, monetary rewards, and apologies. This paper extends prior work on error mitigation by exploring how different methods of apology conveyance may affect people's perceptions of AI agents; we report an online study (N=37) that examines how varying the sincerity of an apology and the assignment of blame (on either the agent itself or others) affects participants' perceptions and experience with erroneous AI agents. We found that agents that openly accepted the blame and apologized sincerely for mistakes were thought to be more intelligent, likeable, and effective in recovering from errors than agents that shifted the blame to others.",,第1页.xls

This study focuses on algorithmic crime mapping, a prevalent yet underexplored form of algorithmic decision support (ADS) in this context. We conducted experiments and follow-up interviews with 60 participants, including community members, technical experts, and law enforcement agents (LEAs), to explore how lived experiences, technical knowledge, and domain expertise shape interactions with the ADS, impacting human-AI decision-making. Surprisingly, we found that domain experts (LEAs) often exhibited anchoring bias, readily accepting and engaging with the first crime map presented to them. Conversely, community members and technical experts were more inclined to engage with the tool, adjust controls, and generate different maps. Our findings highlight that all three stakeholders were able to provide critical feedback regarding AI design and use - community members questioned the core motivation of the tool, technical experts drew attention to the elastic nature of data science practice, and LEAs suggested redesign pathways such that the tool could complement their domain expertise.",,第1页.xls
119,Human-AI Shared Control via Policy Dissection,2022,"Human-AI shared control allows human to interact and collaborate with autonomous agents to accomplish control tasks in complex environments. Previous Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods attempted goal-conditioned designs to achieve human-controllable policies at the cost of redesigning the reward function and training paradigm. Inspired by the neuroscience approach to investigate the motor cortex in primates, we develop a simple yet effective frequency-based approach called Policy Dissection to align the intermediate representation of the learned neural controller with the kinematic attributes of the agent behavior. Without modifying the neural controller or retraining the model, the proposed approach can convert a given RL-trained policy into a human-controllable policy. We evaluate the proposed approach on many RL tasks such as autonomous driving and locomotion. The experiments show that human-AI shared control system achieved by Policy Dissection in driving task can substantially improve the performance and safety in unseen traffic scenes. With human in the inference loop, the locomotion robots also exhibit versatile controllable motion skills even though they are only trained to move forward. Our results suggest the promising direction of implementing human-AI shared autonomy through interpreting the learned representation of the autonomous agents.

120,Exploratory Models of Human-AI Teams: Leveraging Human Digital Twins to Investigate Trust Development,2024,"As human-agent teaming (HAT) research continues to grow, computational methods for modeling HAT behaviors and measuring HAT effectiveness also continue to develop. One rising method involves the use of human digital twins (HDT) to approximate human behaviors and socio-emotional-cognitive reactions to AI-driven agent team members. In this paper, we address three research questions relating to the use of digital twins for modeling trust in HATs. First, to address the question of how we can appropriately model and operationalize HAT trust through HDT HAT experiments, we conducted causal analytics of team communication data to understand the impact of empathy, socio-cognitive, and emotional constructs on trust formation. Additionally, we reflect on the current state of the HAT trust science to discuss characteristics of HAT trust that must be replicable by a HDT such as individual differences in trust tendencies, emergent trust patterns, and appropriate measurement of these characteristics over time. Second, to address the question of how valid measures of HDT trust are for approximating human trust in HATs, we discuss the properties of HDT trust: self-report measures, interaction-based measures, and compliance type behavioral measures. Additionally, we share results of preliminary simulations comparing different LLM models for generating HDT communications and analyze their ability to replicate human-like trust dynamics. Third, to address how HAT experimental manipulations will extend to human digital twin studies, we share experimental design focusing on propensity to trust for HDTs vs. transparency and competency-based trust for AI agents.",,第1页.xls
121,IReCa: Intrinsic Reward-enhanced Context-aware Reinforcement Learning for Human-AI Coordination,2024,"In human-AI coordination scenarios, human agents usually exhibit asymmetric behaviors that are significantly sparse and unpredictable compared to those of AI agents. These characteristics introduce two primary challenges to human-AI coordination: the effectiveness of obtaining sparse rewards and the efficiency of training the AI agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Reward-enhanced Context-aware (IReCa) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, which leverages intrinsic rewards to facilitate the acquisition of sparse rewards and utilizes environmental context to enhance training efficiency. Our IReCa RL algorithm introduces three unique features: (i) it encourages the exploration of sparse rewards by incorporating intrinsic rewards that supplement traditional extrinsic rewards from the environment; (ii) it improves the acquisition of sparse rewards by prioritizing the corresponding sparse state-action pairs; and (iii) it enhances the training efficiency by optimizing the exploration and exploitation through innovative context-aware weights of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. Extensive simulations executed in the Overcooked layouts demonstrate that our IReCa RL algorithm can increase the accumulated rewards by approximately 20% and reduce the epochs required for convergence by approximately 67% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",,第1页.xls

124,Collective Intelligence in Human-AI Teams: A Bayesian Theory of Mind Approach,2023,"We develop a network of Bayesian agents that collectively model the mental states of teammates from the observed communication. Using a generative computational approach to cognition, we make two contributions. First, we show that our agent could generate interventions that improve the collective intelligence of a human-AI team beyond what humans alone would achieve. Second, we develop a real-time measure of human's theory of mind ability and test theories about human cognition. We use data collected from an online experiment in which 145 individuals in 29 human-only teams of five communicate through a chat-based system to solve a cognitive task. We find that humans (a) struggle to fully integrate information from teammates into their decisions, especially when communication load is high, and (b) have cognitive biases which lead them to underweight certain useful, but ambiguous, information. Our theory of mind ability measure predicts both individual- and team-level performance. Observing teams' first 25% of messages explains about 8% of the variation in final team performance, a 170% improvement compared to the current state of the art.",,第1页.xls

In my second study, I designed and developed a conversational agent that documents and reports cases of sexual assault survivors to the police on behalf of the survivors. To discover survivors' burdens and find solutions to mitigate them, I conducted in-depth interviews and participatory design sessions with sexual assault survivors, as well as diverse stakeholders (e.g., police officers, counselors). In my third study, I investigated why employees resist algorithmic evaluations in workplaces and how to mitigate these burdens.

Users had to execute sorting and dispatch tasks in collaboration with a virtual cobot. The degree of social gestalt of the cobot was varied by the ability to make small talk (i.e., talkative vs. non-talkative cobot), and the task load was increased by adding a secondary task (i.e., high vs. low task load condition). Overall, the talkative cobot led to a more positive perception of the cobot and increased social qualities like sense of meaning and team membership compared to the non-talkative cobot. The following gender effect was particularly interesting. The talkative cobot had a buffering effect for women and a distraction conflict effect for men in high task load conditions. When interacting with the talkative robot, women find the high task condition less stressful. In contrast thereto, the talkative cobot was distracting for men in the high task load condition.

128,Empowering Adaptive Human Autonomy Collaboration with Artificial Intelligence,2021,"We can now see examples emerge of intelligent distributed hybrid systems with autonomous functions pursuing a specific goal while adapting dynamically to changing environments. Such solutions are made possible by convergence of new technologies, but achieving comprehensive monitoring of the multiple interactions in their organization and functions along their life cycles, in missions and/or safety critical contexts, still challenges system (of systems) engineering practices. This paper considers the main gaps towards trusted systems of systems, including human-AI collaboration, human-machine teaming and solution effectiveness monitoring in a life cycle perspective. These gaps call for an inter-disciplinary sociotechnical approach in engineering towards Adjustable Human Autonomy Collaboration (DUAL), whose justification is outlined in this position paper.",,第1页.xls
129,Determinants Affecting Consumer Trust in Communication With AI Chatbots: The Moderating Effect of Privacy Concerns,2023,"This paper summarized the factors that influence consumers' trust in AI chatbots and divided it into chatbot-related factors (expertise, anthropomorphism, responsiveness, and ease of use), companyrelated factors (perceived risk, brand trust, human support), and consumer-related factors (privacy concerns). This research attempts to explore the mechanism of human-AI chatbots trust formation and answer the question of how to promote consumers' trust in AI chatbots. The results found that the chatbot-related factors (expertise, responsiveness, and anthropomorphism) positively affect consumers' trust in chatbots. The company-related factor (brand trust) positively affects consumers' trust in chatbots, and perceived risk negatively affect consumers' trust in chatbots. Privacy concerns have a moderating effect on company-related factors. This study helps deepen the understanding of human-AI chatbots communication trust, constructs a basic model of human-AI chatbots trust, and provides insights for e-commerce enterprises to improve chatbots and enhance consumer trust.",,第1页.xls
130,Language Models in Dialogue: Conversational Maxims for Human-AI Interactions,2024,"Modern language models, while sophisticated, exhibit some inherent shortcomings, particularly in conversational settings. We claim that many of the observed shortcomings can be attributed to violation of one or more conversational principles. By drawing upon extensive research from both the social science and AI communities, we propose a set of maxims -- quantity, quality, relevance, manner, benevolence, and transparency -- for describing effective human-AI conversation. We first justify the applicability of the first four maxims (from Grice) in the context of human-AI interactions. We then argue that two new maxims, benevolence (concerning the generation of, and engagement with, harmful content) and transparency (concerning recognition of one's knowledge boundaries, operational constraints, and intents), are necessary for addressing behavior unique to modern human-AI interactions. The proposed maxims offer prescriptive guidance on how to assess conversational quality between humans and LLM-driven conversational agents, informing both their evaluation and improved design.",,第1页.xls
131,A Cognitive Framework for Delegation Between Error-Prone AI and Human Agents,2022,"With humans interacting with AI-based systems at an increasing rate, it is necessary to ensure the artificial systems are acting in a manner which reflects understanding of the human. In the case of humans and artificial AI agents operating in the same environment, we note the significance of comprehension and response to the actions or capabilities of a human from an agent's perspective, as well as the possibility to delegate decisions either to humans or to agents, depending on who is deemed more suitable at a certain point in time. Such capabilities will ensure an improved responsiveness and utility of the entire human-AI system. To that end, we investigate the use of cognitively inspired models of behavior to predict the behavior of both human and AI agents. The predicted behavior, and associated performance with respect to a certain goal, is used to delegate control between humans and AI agents through the use of an intermediary entity. As we demonstrate, this allows overcoming potential shortcomings of either humans or agents in the pursuit of a goal.",,第1页.xls

133,CoQuest: Exploring Research Question Co-Creation with an LLM-based Agent,2024,"Developing novel research questions (RQs) often requires extensive literature reviews, especially in interdisciplinary fields. To support RQ development through human-AI co-creation, we leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to build an LLM-based agent system named CoQuest. We conducted an experiment with 20 HCI researchers to examine the impact of two interaction designs: breadthfirst and depth-first RQ generation. The findings revealed that participants perceived the breadth-first approach as more creative and trustworthy upon task completion. Conversely, during the task, participants considered the depth-first generated RQs as more creative. Additionally, we discovered that AI processing delays allowed users to reflect on multiple RQs simultaneously, leading to a higher quantity of generated RQs and an enhanced sense of control. Our work makes both theoretical and practical contributions by proposing and evaluating a mental model for human-AI co-creation of RQs. We also address potential ethical issues, such as biases and over-reliance on AI, advocating for using the system to improve human research creativity rather than automating scientific inquiry.

134,Watch-And-Help: A Challenge for Social Perception and Human-AI Collaboration [arXiv],2020,"In this paper, we introduce Watch-And-Help (WAH), a challenge for testing social intelligence in agents. In WAH, an AI agent needs to help a human-like agent perform a complex household task efficiently. To succeed, the AI agent needs to i) understand the underlying goal of the task by watching a single demonstration of the human-like agent performing the same task (social perception), and ii) coordinate with the human-like agent to solve the task in an unseen environment as fast as possible (human-AI collaboration). For this challenge, we build VirtualHome-Social, a multi-agent household environment, and provide a benchmark including both planning and learning based baselines. We evaluate the performance of AI agents with the human-like agent as well as with real humans using objective metrics and subjective user ratings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed challenge and virtual environment enable a systematic evaluation on the important aspects of machine social intelligence at scale.",,第1页.xls
135,What is new with Artificial Intelligence? Human-agent interactions through the lens of social agency.,2022,"In this article, we suggest that the study of social interactions and the development of a sense of agency in joint action can help determine the content of relevant explanations to be implemented in artificial systems to make them explainable. The introduction of automated systems, and more broadly of Artificial Intelligence (AI), into many domains has profoundly changed the nature of human activity, as well as the subjective experience that agents have of their own actions and their consequences - an experience that is commonly referred to as sense of agency. We propose to examine the empirical evidence supporting this impact of automation on individuals' sense of agency, and hence on measures as diverse as operator performance, system explicability and acceptability. Because of some of its key characteristics, AI occupies a special status in the artificial systems landscape. We suggest that this status prompts us to reconsider human-AI interactions in the light of human-human relations. We approach the study of joint actions in human social interactions to deduce what key features are necessary for the development of a reliable sense of agency in a social context and suggest that such framework can help define what constitutes a good explanation. Finally, we propose possible directions to improve human-AI interactions and, in particular, to restore the sense of agency of human operators, improve their confidence in the decisions made by artificial agents, and increase the acceptability of such agents.",,第1页.xls
136,Designing for Continuous Interaction with Artificial Intelligence Systems,2022,"The increasing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence enable the support of users in a continuously growing number of applications. Current systems typically dictate that interaction between user input and AI output unfolds in discrete steps, as is the case with, for example, conversational agents. Novel scenarios require AI systems to adapt and respond to continuous user input, e.g., image-guided surgery and AI-supported text entry. In and across these applications, AI systems need to support more varied and dynamic interactions in which users and AI interact continuously and in parallel. Current methods and guidelines are often inadequate and sometimes even detrimental to user needs when considering continuous usage scenarios. Realizing a continuous interaction between users and AI requires a substantial change in perspective when designing Human-AI systems. In this SIG, we support the exchange of cutting-edge research contributing to a better understanding and improved methods and tools to design continuous Human-AI interaction.",,第1页.xls

This view underlies a human-ecology relationship based on resource and knowledge extraction. To create a more sustainable and equitable future, it is essential to consider alternative cultural ideas rooted in ecological thinking. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness between humans and more-than-human worlds. We propose a path to reshape the human-ecology relationship by advocating for alternative human-AI interactions. In this paper, we undertake a critical comparison between anthropocentrism and ecological thinking, using storytelling to illustrate various human-AI interactions that embody ecological thinking. We also delineate a set of design principles aimed at guiding AI developments toward fostering a more caring human-ecology relationship.",,第1页.xls
139,On the Emergence of Symmetrical Reality,2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized human cognitive abilities and facilitated the development of new AI entities capable of interacting with humans in both physical and virtual environments. Despite the existence of virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality for many years, integrating these technical fields remains a formidable challenge due to their disparate application directions. The advent of AI agents, capable of autonomous perception and action, further compounds this issue by exposing the limitations of traditional human-centered research approaches. It is imperative to establish a comprehensive framework that accommodates the dual perceptual centers of humans and AI agents in both physical and virtual worlds. In this paper, we introduce the symmetrical reality framework, which offers a unified representation encompassing various forms of physical-virtual amalgamations. This framework enables researchers to better comprehend how AI agents can collaborate with humans and how distinct technical pathways of physical-virtual integration can be consolidated from a broader perspective. We then delve into the coexistence of humans and AI, demonstrating a prototype system that exemplifies the operation of symmetrical reality systems for specific tasks, such as pouring water. Finally, we propose an instance of an AI-driven active assistance service that illustrates the potential applications of symmetrical reality. This paper aims to offer beneficial perspectives and guidance for researchers and practitioners in different fields, thus contributing to the ongoing research about human-AI coexistence in both physical and virtual environments.",,第1页.xls

141,Approaching (super)human intent recognition in stag hunt with the Naive Utility Calculus generative model,2023,"The human ability to utilize social and behavioral cues to infer each other's intents, infer motivations, and predict future actions is a central process to human social life. This ability represents a facet of human cognition that artificial intelligence has yet to fully mimic and master. Artificial agents with greater social intelligence have wide-ranging applications from enabling the collaboration of human-AI teams to more accurately modelling human behavior in complex systems. Here, we show that the Naive Utility Calculus generative model is capable of competing with leading models in intent recognition and action prediction when observing stag-hunt, a simple multiplayer game where agents must infer each other's intentions to maximize rewards. Moreover, we show the model is the first with the capacity to out-compete human observers in intent recognition after the first round of observation. We conclude with a discussion on implications for the Naive Utility Calculus and of similar generative models in general.",,第1页.xls

We introduce ContextCam, a novel human-AI image co-creation system that integrates context awareness with mainstream AIGC technologies like Stable Diffusion. ContextCam provides user's image creation process with inspiration by extracting relevant contextual data, and leverages Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agents to co-create images with the user. A study with 16 participants and 136 scenarios revealed that ContextCam was well-received, showcasing personalized and diverse outputs as well as interesting user behavior patterns. Participants provided positive feedback on their engagement and enjoyment when using ContextCam, and acknowledged its ability to inspire creativity.",,第1页.xls
143,Towards mutual theory of mind in Human-AI interaction: how language reflects what students perceive about a virtual teaching assistant,2021,"Building conversational agents that can conduct natural and prolonged conversations has been a major technical and design challenge, especially for community-facing conversational agents. We posit Mutual Theory of Mind as a theoretical framework to design for natural long-term human-AI interactions. From this perspective, we explore a communitys perception of a question-answering conversational agent through self-reported surveys and computational linguistic approach in the context of online education. We first examine long-term temporal changes in students perception of Jill Watson (JW), a virtual teaching assistant deployed in an online class discussion forum. We then explore the feasibility of inferring students perceptions of JW through linguistic features extracted from student-JW dialogues. We find that students perception of JWs anthropomorphism and intelligence changed significantly over time. Regression analyses reveal that linguistic verbosity, readability, sentiment, diversity, and adaptability reflect student perception of JW. We discuss implications for building adaptive community-facing conversational agents as long-term companions and designing towards Mutual Theory of Mind in human-AI interaction.",,第1页.xls
144,Preference learning from emotional expressions contributes integrative solutions between human-AI negotiation,2023,"Learning about the counterpart, especially their preference and limits, through pre-play communication is crucial for reaching a win-win solution in negotiations. Although emotional expressions are considered to be honest and credible signals in human-human negotiations, it is still unclear how emotional expressions encoding preference and limits affect the outcome of human-AI negotiations. In the present study, we designed that preferences learning phase of counterpart AI agent from emotional expressions in pre-play communication and four-issue ultimatum game with an AI agent. Participants are going to experience either one phase or two phases of pre-play communication before deciding on their final offer. We hypothesized that participants who experienced two phases, i.e., the preference learning phase in addition to a phase in which simultaneous inference of preferences and limits was possible, were able to reach more integrative solutions than those who did not.",,第1页.xls
145,"Answering Uncertain, Under-Specified API Queries Assisted by Knowledge-Aware Human-AI Dialogue",2024,"Developers' API needs should be more pragmatic, such as seeking suggestive, explainable, and extensible APIs rather than the so-called best result. Existing API search research cannot meet these pragmatic needs because they are solely concerned with query-API relevance. This necessitates a focus on enhancing the entire query process, from query definition to query refinement through intent clarification to query results promoting divergent thinking about results. This paper designs a novel Knowledge-Aware Human-AI Dialog agent (KAHAID) which guides the developer to clarify the uncertain, under-specified query through multi-round question answering and recommends APIs for the clarified query with relevance explanation and extended suggestions (e.g., alternative, collaborating or opposite-function APIs). We systematically evaluate KAHAID. In terms of human-AI dialogue process, it achieves a high diversity of question options (the average diversity between any two options is 74.9%) and the ability to guide developers to find APIs using fewer dialogue rounds (no more than 3 rounds on average). For API recommendation, KAHAID achieves an MRR and MAP of 0.769 and 0.794, outperforming state-of-the-art API search approaches BIKER and CLEAR by at least 47% in MRR and 226.7% in MAP. For knowledge extension, KAHAID obtains an MRR and MAP of 0.815 and 0.864, surpassing state-of-the-art query clarification approaches by at least 42% in MRR and 45.2% in MAP. As the first of its kind, KAHAID opens the door to integrating the immediate response capability of API research and the interaction, clarification, explanation, and extensibility capability of social-technical information seeking.",,第1页.xls

147,Addressing attentional issues in augmented reality with adaptive agents: Possibilities and challenges,2024,"Recent work on augmented reality (AR) has explored the use of adaptive agents to overcome attentional issues that negatively impact task performance. However, despite positive technical evaluations, adaptive agents have shown no significant improvements to user task performance in AR. Furthermore, previous works have primarily evaluated such agents using abstract tasks. In this paper, we develop an agent that observes user behaviour and performs appropriate actions to mitigate attentional issues in a realistic sense-making task in AR. We employ mixed methods to evaluate our agent in a between-subject experiment (N=60) to understand the agent's effect on user task performance and behaviour. While we find no significant improvements in task performance, our analysis revealed that users' preferences and trust in the agent affected their receptiveness of the agent's recommendations. We discuss the pitfalls of autonomous agents and highlight the need to shift from designing better Human-AI interactions to better Human-AI collaborations.",,第1页.xls
148,People judge others more harshly after talking to bots.,2024,"People now commonly interact with Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. How do these interactions shape how humans perceive each other? In two preregistered studies (total N = 1,261), we show that people evaluate other humans more harshly after interacting with an AI (compared with an unrelated purported human). In Study 1, participants who worked on a creative task with AIs (versus purported humans) subsequently rated another purported human's work more negatively. Study 2 replicated this effect and demonstrated that the results hold even when participants believed their evaluation would not be shared with the purported human. Exploratory analyses of participants' conversations show that prior to their human evaluations they were more demanding, more instrumental and displayed less positive affect towards AIs (versus purported humans). These findings point to a potentially worrisome side effect of the exponential rise in human-AI interactions.",,第1页.xls

151,Human-AI cooperation: Modes and their effects on attitudes,2022,"Since advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have allowed AI to live and work with humans as independent agents, it has become increasingly common for people to cooperate with autonomous AI agents, which is known as human-AI cooperation (HAIC). The purpose of this research is to explore the various modes of HAIC and their effects on people's attitudes. The current paper presents a between-group study conducted by dividing samples into two groups, i.e., a human-human cooperation group and a HAIC group. A total of 1367 samples are investigated. By employing confirmatory factor analysis, we identify-four modes of HAIC: interdependent exploitation, independent exploitation, interdependent exploration, and independent exploration. By conducting a multigroup comparative analysis, we find that people prefer interdependent exploration modes and dislike independent exploitation and independent exploration modes when cooperating with AI. Our study provides insights into the modes of HAIC and the effects of these modes on people's attitudes. All rights reserved Elsevier.",,第1页.xls
152,Hybrid collective intelligence in a human-AI society,2021,"Within current debates about the future impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on human society, roughly three different perspectives can be recognised: (1) thetechnology-centric perspective, claiming that AI will soon outperform humankind in all areas, and that the primary threat for humankind is superintelligence; (2) thehuman-centric perspective, claiming that humans will always remain superior to AI when it comes to social and societal aspects, and that the main threat of AI is that humankind's social nature is overlooked in technological designs; and (3)the collective intelligence-centric perspective, claiming that true intelligence lies in the collective of intelligent agents, both human and artificial, and that the main threat for humankind is that technological designs create problems at the collective, systemic level that are hard to oversee and control. The current paper offers the following contributions: (a) a clear description for each of the three perspectives, along with their history and background; (b) an analysis and interpretation of current applications of AI in human society according to each of the three perspectives, thereby disentangling miscommunication in the debate concerning threats of AI; and (c) a new integrated and comprehensive research design framework that addresses all aspects of the above three perspectives, and includes principles that support developers to reflect and anticipate upon potential effects of AI in society.",,第1页.xls
153,Understanding Nonlinear Collaboration between Human and AI Agents: A Co-design Framework for Creative Design [arXiv],2024,"Creative design is a nonlinear process where designers generate diverse ideas in the pursuit of an open-ended goal and converge towards consensus through iterative remixing. In contrast, AI-powered design tools often employ a linear sequence of incremental and precise instructions to approximate design objectives. Such operations violate customary creative design practices and thus hinder AI agents' ability to complete creative design tasks. To explore better human-AI co-design tools, we first summarize human designers' practices through a formative study with 12 design experts. Taking graphic design as a representative scenario, we formulate a nonlinear human-AI co-design framework and develop a proof-of-concept prototype, OptiMuse. We evaluate OptiMuse and validate the nonlinear framework through a comparative study. We notice a subconscious change in people's attitudes towards AI agents, shifting from perceiving them as mere executors to regarding them as opinionated colleagues. This shift effectively fostered the exploration and reflection processes of individual designers.",,第1页.xls
154,How AI Processing Delays Foster Creativity: Exploring Research Question Co-Creation with an LLM-based Agent [arXiv],2023,"Developing novel research questions (RQs) often requires extensive literature reviews, especially for interdisciplinary fields. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), we built an LLM-based agent system, called CoQuest, supporting RQ development through human-AI co-creation. We conducted an experimental design with 20 participants to examine the effect of two interaction designs: breadth-first and depth-first RQ generation. The results showed that participants found the breadth-first approach more creative and trustworthy upon task completion. However, during the task, they rated the RQs generated through the depth-first approach as more creative. We also discovered that AI processing delays allowed users to contemplate multiple RQs simultaneously, resulting in more generated RQs and an increased sense of perceived control. Our work makes both theoretical and practical contributions by proposing and assessing a mental model for human-AI co-creation RQs.",,第1页.xls

We focus on chat-based interactions powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), because of their increasing availability and extensive use for knowledge-based and creative work. We present four areas in which the different temporal characteristics of humans and of LLMs influence the interaction between them: interaction pace, temporal context, continuity over time, and rhythm and attunement. In each area we discuss these differences and their pitfalls and potentials, point to current choices made by the designers of LLM interfaces, make initial speculations about possible design opportunities, and suggest open research questions in the context of work. Finally, we propose a number of LLM agent personas that integrate different temporal characteristics into a coherent interaction model in a work-based collaboration.",,第1页.xls
156,Implicit Communication of Actionable Information in Human-AI teams,2019,"Humans expect their collaborators to look beyond the explicit interpretation of their words. Implicature is a common form of implicit communication that arises in natural language discourse when an utterance leverages context to imply information beyond what the words literally convey. Whereas computational methods have been proposed for interpreting and using different forms of implicature, its role in human and artificial agent collaboration has not yet been explored in a concrete domain. The results of this paper provide insights to how artificial agents should be structured to facilitate natural and efficient communication of actionable information with humans. We investigated implicature by implementing two strategies for playing Hanabi, a cooperative card game that relies heavily on communication of actionable implicit information to achieve a shared goal. In a user study with 904 completed games and 246 completed surveys, human players randomly paired with an implicature AI are 71% more likely to think their partner is human than players paired with a non-implicature AI. These teams demonstrated game performance similar to other state of the art approaches.",,第1页.xls
157,The Impact of Gender and Personality in Human-AI Teaming: The Case of Collaborative Question Answering,2023,"This paper discusses the results of an exploratory study aimed at investigating the impact of conversational agents (CAs) and specifically their agential characteristics on collaborative decision-making processes. The study involved 29 participants divided into 8 small teams engaged in a question-and-answer trivia-style game with the support of a text-based CA, characterized by two independent binary variables: personality (gentle and cooperative vs blunt and uncooperative) and gender (female vs male). A semi-structured group interview was conducted at the end of the experimental sessions to investigate the perceived utility and level of satisfaction with the CAs. Our results show that when users interact with a gentle and cooperative CA, their user satisfaction is higher. Furthermore, female CAs are perceived as more useful and satisfying to interact with than male CAs. We show that group performance improves through interaction with the CAs, confirming that a stereotype favoring the female with a gentle and cooperative personality combination exists in regard to perceived satisfaction, even though this does not lead to greater perceived utility. Our study extends the current debate about the possible correlation between CA characteristics and human acceptance and suggests future research to investigate the role of gender bias and related biases in human-AI teaming.",,第1页.xls
158,Efficient Evaluation of AI Workers for the Human+AI Crowd Task Assignment,2022,"Nowadays, it is a common practice for crowd workers to develop ML models that classify data items. We envision the Human+AI crowd where crowd programmers develop AI workers, which are black-box software agents that work among other human workers. The problem here is evaluating such AI workers is different from evaluating human workers in that they may not be spam workers, although they have low accuracy at the beginning of their learning process or for a particular label. Therefore, existing work evaluates the output from AI workers every time they output the task results. Obviously, such a naive evaluation does not scale because there are a tremendous number of task results to be evaluated. This paper addresses the problem of how to efficiently evaluate AI worker outputs by skipping the AI evaluation when the AI is unlikely to satisfy the expected accuracy. We conducted an experiment to compare two strategies and found that both reduce the number of evaluations by orders of magnitude while keeping the number of task assignments to AI workers.",,第1页.xls
159,Decision Deferral in a Human-AI Joint Face-Matching Task: Effects on Human Performance and Trust,2021,"This study investigates how human performance and trust are affected by the decision deferral rates of an AI-enabled decision support system in a high criticality domain such as security screening, where ethical and legal considerations prevent full automation. In such domains, deferring cases to a human agent becomes an essential process component. However, the systemic consequences of the rate of deferrals on human performance are unknown. In this study, a face-matching task with an automated face verification system was designed to investigate the effects of varying deferral rates. Results show that higher deferral rates are associated with higher sensitivity and higher workload, but lower throughput and lower trust in the AI. We conclude that deferral rates can affect performance and trust perceptions. The tradeoffs between deferral rate, sensitivity, throughput, and trust need to be considered in designing effective human-AI work systems.",,第1页.xls
160,Psychological and Brain Responses to Artificial Intelligence's Violation of Community Ethics.,2024,"Human moral reactions to artificial intelligence (AI) agents' behavior constitute an important aspect of modern-day human-AI relationships. Although previous studies have mainly focused on autonomy ethics, this study investigates how individuals judge AI agents' violations of community ethics (including betrayals and subversions) compared with human violations. Participants' behavioral responses, event-related potentials (ERPs), and individual differences were assessed. Behavioral findings reveal that participants rated AI agents' community-violating actions less morally negative than human transgressions, possibly because AI agents are commonly perceived as having less agency than human adults. The ERP N1 component showed the same pattern with moral rating scores, indicating the modulation effect of human-AI differences on initial moral intuitions. Moreover, the level of social withdrawal correlated with a smaller N1 in the human condition but not in the AI condition. The N2 and P2 components were sensitive to the difference between the loyalty/betrayal and authority/subversion domains but not human/AI differences. Individual levels of moral sense and autistic traits also influenced behavioral data, especially on the loyalty/betrayal domain. In our opinion, these findings offer insights for predicting moral responses to AI agents and guiding ethical AI development aligned with human moral values.",,第1页.xls
161,Explainable Human-AI Interaction: A Planning Perspective,2024,"From its inception, AI has had a rather ambivalent relationship with humans -- swinging between their augmentation and replacement. Now, as AI technologies enter our everyday lives at an ever increasing pace, there is a greater need for AI systems to work synergistically with humans. One critical requirement for such synergistic human-AI interaction is that the AI systems be explainable to the humans in the loop. To do this effectively, AI agents need to go beyond planning with their own models of the world, and take into account the mental model of the human in the loop. Drawing from several years of research in our lab, we will discuss how the AI agent can use these mental models to either conform to human expectations, or change those expectations through explanatory communication. While the main focus of the book is on cooperative scenarios, we will point out how the same mental models can be used for obfuscation and deception. Although the book is primarily driven by our own research in these areas, in every chapter, we will provide ample connections to relevant research from other groups.",,第1页.xls
162,When is a Tool a Tool? User Perceptions of System Agency in Human-AI Co-Creative Drawing,2023,"This paper presents an analysis of the user experience of Reframer, a novel human-AI drawing interface designed with the iterative and reflective nature of creativity in mind. Collaboration with Reframer occurs in real time, with the user and the system drawing together concurrently. This approach is inspired by theories of creativity as being more problem-framing than problem-solving, and contrasts with the automated one-shot end-to-end workflows of most generative AI models. A 12-participant qualitative exploratory study of the capabilities of our prototype is detailed, as well as a thematic analysis of user attitudes towards drawing with it. The paper then describes two modified prototypes and a second 32-participant comparative study revealing how interface variations evoke differences in user attitudes and experiences. It concludes by proposing a model that characterises the conditions under which users experience co-creative AI as a collaborator, rather than a non-agentive tool.",,第1页.xls

We propose a framework for human-AI collaboration that gives humans ultimate control of the results of a problem solving task while playing to the strengths of the AI by persisting an agent's search trees and allowing humans to explore and search this search tree. This allows the use of AI in exploratory problem solving contexts. We demonstrate this framework applied to algebraic problem solving, and show that it enables a unique mode of interaction with symbolic computer algebra through the automatic completion and correction of traditional derivations, both in digital ink and textual keyboard input.",,第1页.xls
164,UX Research on Conversational Human-AI Interaction: A Literature Review of the ACM Digital Library,2022,"Early conversational agents (CAs) focused on dyadic human-AI interaction between humans and the CAs, followed by the increasing popularity of polyadic human-AI interaction, in which CAs are designed to mediate human-human interactions. CAs for polyadic interactions are unique because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA, human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on polyadic CAs is scattered across diferent felds, making it challenging to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM publications and identifed a set of works that conducted UX (user experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the efects of polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e., communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance. Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the efects. Our fndings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy, disclosure, and identifcation, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs. Future research should also advance usability testing methods and trust-building guidelines for conversational AI.",,第1页.xls
165,The Voice: Lessons on Trustworthy Conversational Agents from 'Dune',2024,"The potential for untrustworthy conversational agents presents a significant threat for covert social manipulation. Taking inspiration from Frank Herbert's Dune [12], where the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood uses the Voice for influence, manipulation, and control of people, we explore how generative AI provides a way to implement individualized influence at industrial scales. Already, these models can manipulate communication across text, image, speech, and most recently video. They are rapidly becoming affordable enough for any organization of even moderate means to train and deploy. If employed by malicious actors, they risk becoming powerful tools for shaping public opinion, sowing discord, and undermining organizations from companies to governments. As researchers and developers, it is crucial to recognize the potential for such weaponization and to explore strategies for prevention, detection, and defense against these emerging forms of sociotechnical manipulation.",,第1页.xls
166,Interactive AI with a Theory of Mind [arXiv],2019,"Understanding each other is the key to success in collaboration. For humans, attributing mental states to others, the theory of mind, provides the crucial advantage. We argue for formulating human-AI interaction as a multi-agent problem, endowing AI with a computational theory of mind to understand and anticipate the user. To differentiate the approach from previous work, we introduce a categorisation of user modelling approaches based on the level of agency learnt in the interaction. We describe our recent work in using nested multi-agent modelling to formulate user models for multi-armed bandit based interactive AI systems, including a proof-of-concept user study.",,第1页.xls
167,Coevo: a collaborative design platform with artificial agents [arXiv],2019,"We present Coevo, an online platform that allows both humans and artificial agents to design shapes that solve different tasks. Our goal is to explore common shared design tools that can be used by humans and artificial agents in a context of creation. This approach can provide a better knowledge transfer and interaction with artificial agents since a common language of design is defined. In this paper, we outline the main components of this platform and discuss the definition of a human-centered language to enhance human-AI collaboration in co-creation scenarios.",,第1页.xls
168,Hiring an AI: Incorporating Personnel Selection Methods in User-Centered Design to Design AI Agents for Safety-Critical Domains,2024,"Enhancing human teams with AI is currently aspired across application domains. However, the prospective team role of high-performing AI-agents is rarely considered. In this paper, we propose a new method complementing existing user-centered design processes to define an AI-agent personality that suits the team. Inspired by personnel selection methods, the hiring an AI workshop prompts teams from safety-critical domains to 1) remember past incidents, 2) envision the personality and competence of their desired teammate, and 3) validate how the teammate would act in described incidents. Clustering and modeling the data made it accessible to interdisciplinary teams. Incorporating the models into the ideation process and revisiting the data for a personality drill-down exceeded insights from contextual inquiries and had a measurable impact (i.e., downstream utility) on the visions. Participants' humanizing descriptions of a knowing and competent, yet modest teammate raise challenges for technical implementation and questions on future team-collaboration in safety-critical domains.",,第1页.xls
169,Towards Designing Enthusiastic AI Agents,2021,"Immersive virtual worlds are increasingly being used for education, training, and entertainment, and virtual humans that can interact with human users in these worlds play many important roles. Understating the emotional constructs of the user and generating multimodal forms of communications that are aligned with the user's needs and input is key to designing AI agents. Most virtual agents and communicative systems lack the ability to understand enthusiasm or generate multimodal enthusiastic communicative presentations. In this work, we argue for the importance of including enthusiasm in the design of human-AI collaboration and communication and review the existing datasets and models that can be used to bridge the gap in this area.",,第1页.xls
170,Attaining Human`s Desirable Outcomes in Human-AI Interaction via Structural Causal Games,2024,"In human-AI interaction, a prominent goal is to attain human`s desirable outcome with the assistance of AI agents, which can be ideally delineated as a problem of seeking the optimal Nash Equilibrium that matches the human`s desirable outcome. However, reaching the outcome is usually challenging due to the existence of multiple Nash Equilibria that are related to the assisting task but do not correspond to the human`s desirable outcome. To tackle this issue, we employ a theoretical framework called structural causal game (SCG) to formalize the human-AI interactive process. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy referred to as pre-policy intervention on the SCG to steer AI agents towards attaining the human`s desirable outcome. In more detail, a pre-policy is learned as a generalized intervention to guide the agents` policy selection, under a transparent and interpretable procedure determined by the SCG. To make the framework practical, we propose a reinforcement learning-like algorithm to search out this pre-policy. The proposed algorithm is tested in both gridworld environments and realistic dialogue scenarios with large language models, demonstrating its adaptability in a broader class of problems and potential effectiveness in real-world situations.",,第1页.xls
171,Promoting human-AI interaction makes a better adoption of deep reinforcement learning: a real-world application in game industry,2023,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely employed in game industry, mainly for building automatic game agents. While its performance and efficiency has significantly outperformed traditional approaches, the lack of model transparency constrains the interaction between the model and the human operators, thus degrading the practicality of DRL methods. In this paper, we propose to mitigate this human-AI interaction issue in a game industry scenario. Previously, existing methods need repetitive execution of DRL or are designed towards specific tasks, which are not applicable for our deployment scenario. Considering that different games could have different DRL AI agents, we hereby develop a post-hoc explanation framework which regards original DRL as a black-box model and can be applicable to any DRL based agents. Within the framework, a specially selected student model, which has been already well explored for model explanation, is employed to learn the decision policies of the trained DRL model. Then, by giving explanation information for the student model, indirect but practical explanation results can be obtained for original DRL model. Based on this information, the interaction between human and AI agents can be enhanced, benefiting deployment of DRL. Finally, based on the dataset from a real-world production game, we conduct experiments and user studies to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure from both objective and subjective perspectives.",,第1页.xls
172,Multi-agent Naive Utility Calculus: Intent Recognition in the Stag-Hunt Game,2021,"The human ability to utilize social and behavioral cues to infer each others intents, infer motivations, and predict future actions is a central process to human social life. This ability represents a facet of human cognition that artificial intelligence has yet to fully mimic and master. Artificial agents with greater social intelligence have wide-ranging applications from enabling the collaboration of human-AI teams to more accurately modelling human behavior in complex systems. Here, we show that the Naive Utility Calculus generative model is capable of competing with leading models in intent recognition and action prediction when observingstag-hunt, a simple multiplayer game where agents must infer each others intentions to maximize rewards. Moreover, we show the model is the first with the capacity to out-compete human observers in intent recognition after the first round of observation.",,第1页.xls
173,DECI: A Tutorial on Designing Effective Conversational Interfaces,2023,"Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) have been argued to have advantages over traditional GUIs due to having a more human-like interaction. The growing popularity of conversational agents has enabled humans to interact with machines more naturally. There is an increasing familiarity among people with conversational interactions mediated by technology due to the widespread use of mobile devices and messaging services and a hungry market for conversational agents. Based on the recent advances in conversational AI, as a result of the proliferation of large language models, the signs are that the future of human-computer interaction will have a significant conversational component. Today, over two-thirds of the population on our planet has access to the Internet, with ever-lowering barriers to accessibility. This tutorial will showcase the benefits of employing novel conversational interfaces for crowd computing, human-AI decision making, health and well-being, and information retrieval. Given the widespread adoption of AI systems across several domains, we will discuss the potential of conversational interfaces in facilitating and mediating people's interactions with AI systems. The tutorial will include interactive elements and discussions and provide participants with insights to inform the design of effective conversational interfaces.",,第1页.xls
174,FLASH CRASHES IN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS USING MINORITY GAMES AND REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TO TEST AI SAFETY,2019,"As AI advances and becomes more complicated, it becomes necessary to study the safety implications of its behavior. This paper expands upon prior AI-safety research to create a model to study the harmful outcomes of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we outline previous work that has highlighted multiple aspects of AI-safety research and focus on AI-safety systems in multi-agent systems. After overviewing previous literature, we present a model focused on flash crashes, a concept often found in economics. The model was constructed using an interdisciplinary approach that includes game theory, machine learning, cognitive science and systems theory to study flash crashes in complex human-AI systems. We use the model to study a complex interaction between AI-agents, and our results indicate the multi-agent system in question is prone to cause flash crashes.",,第1页.xls
175,Effects of Explanation Strategy and Autonomy of Explainable AI on Human-AI Collaborative Decision-making,2024,"This study examined the effects of explanation strategy (global explanation vs. deductive explanation vs. contrastive explanation) and autonomy level (high vs. low) of explainable agents on human-AI collaborative decision-making. A 3 x 2 mixed-design experiment was conducted. The decision-making task was a modified Mahjong game. Forty-eight participants were divided into three groups, each collaborating with an agent with a different explanation strategy. Each agent had two autonomy levels. The results indicated that global explanation incurred the lowest mental workload and highest understandability. Contrastive explanation required the highest mental workload but incurred the highest perceived competence, affect-based trust, and social presence. Deductive explanation was found to be the worst in terms of social presence. The high-autonomy agents incurred lower mental workload and interaction fluency but higher faith and social presence than the low-autonomy agents. The findings of this study can help practitioners in designing user-centered explainable decision-support agents and choosing appropriate explanation strategies for different situations.",,第1页.xls
176,Experimental evidence of effective human-Al collaboration in medical decision-making,2022,"Artificial Intelligence (Al) systems are precious support for decision-making, with many applications also in the medical domain. The interaction between mos and Al enjoys a renewed interest following the increased possibilities of deep learning devices. However, we still have limited evidence-based knowledge of the context, design, and psychological mechanisms that craft an optimal human-Al collaboration. In this multicentric study, 21 endoscopists reviewed 504 videos of lesions prospectively acquired from real colonoscopies. They were asked to provide an optical diagnosis with and without the assistance of an Al support system. Endoscopists were influenced by Al (or = 3.05), but not erratically: they followed the Al advice more when it was correct (or = 3.48) than incorrect (or = 1.85). Endoscopists achieved this outcome through a weighted integration of their and the Al opinions, considering the case-by-case estimations of the two reliabilities. This Bayesian-like rational behavior allowed the human-Al hybrid team to outperform both agents taken alone. We discuss the features of the human-Al interaction that determined this favorable outcome.",,第1页.xls
177,What matters in AI-supported learning: A study of human-AI interactions in language learning using cluster analysis and epistemic network analysis,2023,"This study investigates how students interact with artificial intelligence (AI) for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning and what matters in AI-supported EFL learning. It was con-ducted in naturalistic learning settings, involving sixteen primary school students and lasting approximately three months. The students' usage data of an AI agent and their reflection essays about the interactions with the AI agent were analyzed using cluster analysis and epistemic network analysis based on the frameworks of community of inquiry and students' approaches to learning. The results suggest four clusters of students, each with its distinct way of interacting with AI for language learning. More importantly, the comparisons of the four clusters of students reveal that even in AI-supported learning, not everyone can benefit from the potential promised by AI. The deep approach to AI-supported learning may amplify the benefits of AI's personalized guidance and strengthen the sense of the human-AI learning community. Passively or mechani-cally following AI's instruction, albeit with high levels of participation, may decrease the sense of the human-AI learning community and eventually lead to low performance. This study contrib-utes to and has implications for the educational implementation of AI, as well as the facilitation and graphical representation of learner-AI interactions in educational settings.",,第1页.xls

179,The human-centric Industry 5.0 collaboration architecture.,2023,"While the primary focus of Industry 4.0 revolves around extensive digitalization, Industry 5.0, on the other hand, seeks to integrate innovative technologies with human actors, signifying an approach that is more value-driven than technology-centric. The key objectives of the Industry 5.0 paradigm, which were not central to Industry 4.0, underscore that production should not only be digitalized but also resilient, sustainable, and human-centric. This paper is focusing on the human-centric pillar of Industry 5.0. The proposed methodology addresses the need for a human-AI collaborative process design and innovation approach to support the development and deployment of advanced AI-driven co-creation and collaboration tools. The method aims to solve the problem of integrating various innovative agents (human, AI, IoT, robot) in a plant-level collaboration process through a generic semantic definition, utilizing a time event-driven process. It also encourages the development of AI techniques for human-in-the-loop optimization, incorporating cross-checking with alternative feedback loop models. Benefits of this methodology include the Industry 5.0 collaboration architecture (I5arc), which provides new adaptable, generic frameworks, concepts, and methodologies for modern knowledge creation and sharing to enhance plant collaboration processes. The I5arc aims to investigate and establish a truly integrated human-AI collaboration model, equipped with methods and tools for human-AI driven co-creation.Provide a framework for the co-execution of processes and activities, with humans remaining empowered and in control.The framework primarily targets human-AI collaboration processes and activities in industrial plants, with potential applicability to other societal contexts.",,第1页.xls
180,Responsible Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence for the Cognitive Enhancement of Knowledge Workers,2022,"Over the past decade, the demand for high-performing knowledge workers (KWs) has grown at an unprecedented rate and shows no signs of slowing. Researchers, designers, engineers, and executives are examples of KWs that perform non-routine, creative work. The work outcomes of KWs as individuals, teams, and organizations play a vital role in the global economy and quality of life. One of the most significant challenges KWs face is balancing stressors on their cognitive and emotional well-being while seeking high productivity. Human cognitive enhancement proposes improving human abilities to acquire and generate knowledge and understand the world. Our cognitive enhancement application for KWs, called the Flow Choice Architecture (FCA), senses their cognitive and affective states, adds context, and recommends appropriate nudges to maximize their healthy flow time. This study provides insights into how FCA implements Human-Centered Design and Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) principles as an interactive AI-powered application that promotes healthy flow performance during knowledge work. FCA applied the RAI tools from Microsoft's Human-AI eXperience Toolkit to evaluate FCA-specific scenarios. By defining FCA as a hybrid recommendation system and conversational AI agent, we found the following categories of human-AI failure scenarios in FCA: input errors, trigger errors, delimiter errors, and response generation errors. We recommend simulating these errors and undesirable behaviors to improve the design of explainable nudges, meaningful metrics, and well-tuned triggers. The outcome of this RAI evaluation was a robust FCA system design that meets the needs of KWs and enhances their capability to thrive and flourish at work.",,第1页.xls

We investigate the mutual learning journey of non-AI experts and AI through CoAGent, a service co-creation tool with LLM-based agents. Engaging in a three-stage participatory design processes, we work with with 23 domain experts from public libraries across the U.S., uncovering their fundamental challenges of integrating AI into human workflows. Our findings provide 23 actionable heuristics for service co-creation with AI, highlighting the nuanced shared responsibilities between humans and AI. We further exemplar 9 foundational agency aspects for AI, emphasizing essentials like ownership, fair treatment, and freedom of expression.

182,Comparing and Evaluating Human and Computationally Derived Representations of Non-Semantic Design Information,2024,"Design artifacts provide a mechanism for illustrating design information and concepts, but their effectiveness relies on alignment across design agents in what these artifacts represent. This work investigates the agreement between multi-modal representations of design artifacts by humans and artificial intelligence (AI). Design artifacts are considered to constitute stimuli designers interact with to become inspired (i.e., inspirational stimuli), for which retrieval often relies on computational methods using AI. To facilitate this process for multi-modal stimuli, a better understanding of human perspectives of non-semantic representations of design information, e.g., by form or function-based features, is motivated. This work compares and evaluates human and AI-based representations of 3D-model parts by visual and functional features. Humans and AI were found to share consistent representations of visual and functional similarities, which aligned well with coarse, but not more granular, levels of similarity. Human-AI alignment was higher for identifying low compared to high similarity parts, suggesting mutual representation of features underlying more obvious than nuanced differences. Human evaluation of part relationships in terms of belonging to the same or different categories revealed that human and AI-derived relationships similarly reflect concepts of near and far. However, levels of similarity corresponding to near and far differed depending on the criteria evaluated, where far was associated with nearer visually than functionally related stimuli. These findings contribute to a fundamental understanding of human evaluation of information conveyed by AI-represented design artifacts needed for successful human-AI collaboration in design.",,第1页.xls
183,Designing for Human-Agent Alignment: Understanding what humans want from their agents,2024,"Our ability to build autonomous agents that leverage Generative AI continues to increase by the day. As builders and users of such agents it is unclear what parameters we need to align on before the agents start performing tasks on our behalf. To discover these parameters, we ran a qualitative empirical research study about designing agents that can negotiate during a fictional yet relatable task of selling a camera online. We found that for an agent to perform the task successfully, humans/users and agents need to align over 6 dimensions: 1) Knowledge Schema Alignment 2) Autonomy and Agency Alignment 3) Operational Alignment and Training 4) Reputational Heuristics Alignment 5) Ethics Alignment and 6) Human Engagement Alignment. These empirical findings expand previous work related to process and specification alignment and the need for values and safety in Human-AI interactions. Subsequently we discuss three design directions for designers who are imagining a world filled with Human-Agent collaborations.",,第1页.xls
184,You've Got a Friend in Me: A Formal Understanding of the Critical Friend Agent,2023,"State-of-the-art intelligent and interactive agents, such as Alexa or Siri, often present overly conforming behaviour during interactions with humans. This can result in a misalignment between end-user expectations and agent behaviour. To overcome this barrier in human-AI interactions, we introduce the Critical Friend (CF), a conceptual idea that guides critical behaviour in human-human interactions. We present our results as a formal understanding that can be described through description logic and utilised for reasoning capabilities, enabling implementations of the CF as an intelligent interactive agent.",,第1页.xls
185,Accountability Increases Resource Sharing: Effects of Accountability on Human and AI System Performance,2021,"Accountability pressures have been found to increase worker engagement and reduce adverse biases in people interacting with automated technology, but it is unclear if these effects can be observed in a more laterally controlled human-AI task. To address this question, 40 participants were asked to coordinate with an AI agent on a resource-management task, with half of the participants expecting to justify their decision strategy, which comprised our accountability condition. We then considered the effects of accountability on performance, as measured by participants' resource sharing behaviors, their individual, and joint task scores (throughput), and their perceived workload. Participants in the accountability group shared more resources with their AI partner, took more time to make decisions, and performed worse in the task individually, but had AI partners who performed better. We found no difference between groups on how prepared they felt they were to justify their decisions, and participants reported similar levels of workload. Results suggest accountability pressures can influence exchange strategies in human-AI tasks with lateral control.",,第1页.xls
186,The effect of gender stereotypes on artificial intelligence recommendations,2022,"This study explores the effects of gender stereotypes on evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations. We predict that gender stereotypes will affect human-AI interactions, resulting in somewhat different persuasive effects of AI recommendations for utilitarian vs. hedonic products. We found that participants in the male AI agent condition gave higher competence scores than in the female AI agent condition. Contrariwise, perceived warmth was higher in the female AI agent condition than in the male condition. More importantly, a significant interaction effect between AI gender and product type was found, suggesting that participants showed more positive attitudes toward the AI recommendations when the male AI recommended a utilitarian (vs. hedonic) product. Conversely, a hedonic product was evaluated more positively when advised by the female (vs. male) AI agent. All rights reserved Elsevier.",,第1页.xls
187,Improving Zero-Shot Coordination with Diversely Rewarded Partner Agents,2024,"Zero-shot coordination studies the training of well-generalizing human-AI coordination agents in the scenario where human data is unavailable. To obtain a coordination agent generalize to unseen humans, prevailing methods generate a population of partner agents as proxy models of human partners and then train a coordination agent with these partner agents. Constructed partner agents are expected to be as diverse as possible to cover a wide range of human behaviors, preventing a distribution shift between training and testing stages. Recent works concentrate on studying effective methods of creating a group of high-reward while diverse partner agents to model unseen human partners. However, the resulting high-reward partner agents do not accurately reflect real-world situations, considering that human decisions are not always optimal and may sometimes even hinder the progression of coordination. Therefore, these studies still struggle to capture the potential characteristics of human partners. In this work, reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) are integrated to train a reward-conditioned policy. By conditioned on different desired rewards, a reward-conditioned policy simulates both low-reward and high-reward partners. Additionally, a reward-bucketed replay buffer and curriculum learning are applied to enhance reward diversity and boost the training of coordination agents. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed reward-conditioned policy is capable of generating agents with different rewards. Moreover, the zero-shot coordination performance of agents trained with these partners surpasses previous methods in the majority of scenarios within the Overcooked human-AI coordination benchmark.",,第1页.xls
188,CPS-TaskForge: Generating Collaborative Problem Solving Environments for Diverse Communication Tasks,2024,"Teams can outperform individuals; could adding AI teammates further bolster performance of teams solving problems collaboratively? Collaborative problem solving (CPS) research commonly studies teams with two agents (human-human or human-AI), but team research literature finds that, for complex tasks, larger teams are more effective. Progress in studying collaboration with more than two agents, through textual records of team interactions, is hindered by a major data challenge: available CPS corpora are predominantly dyadic, and adapting pre-existing CPS tasks to more agents is non-trivial. We address this data challenge by developing a CPS task generator, CPS-TaskForge, that can produce environments for studying CPS under a wide array of conditions, and releasing a CPS task design checklist grounded in the theoretical PISA 2015 CPS framework to help facilitate the development of CPS corpora with more agents. CPS-TaskForge takes the form of a resource management (tower defense) game, and different CPS tasks can be studied by manipulating game design parameters. We conduct a case study with groups of 3-4 humans to validate production of diverse natural language CPS communication in a game instance produced by CPS-TaskForge. We discuss opportunities for advancing research in CPS (both with human-only and human-AI teams) using different task configurations. We will release data and code.",,第1页.xls
189,Human-in-the-loop Hybrid-augmented Intelligence Method for Power System Dispatching: Basic Concept and Research Framework,2023,"Power system is a typical complex system, which has the characteristics of openness, uncertainty, fragility and multi-factors highly coupling. With the construction of the new-type power system, the scale and complexity of the system is being elevated as never before. The traditional dispatching approaches for the safe and stable operation of the power system will face severe challenges under the new situation. The artificial intelligence is needed to improve the efficiency and performance of the analysis and decisions. In order to reduce the application risk and promote the capability evolution of artificial intelligence, this paper proposes the basic concept and research framework of the human-in-the-loop hybrid- augmented-intelligence method for power system dispatching. The principles and overall research strategy are discussed. Furthermore, the human-AI task assignment, interpretable interaction, human-intervention learning, multi-human-agent cooperation and evolution of hybrid-augmented intelligence approaches are discussed.

190,Dynamic Selection of Reliance Calibration Cues With AI Reliance Model,2023,"Understanding what an AI system can and cannot do is necessary for end-users to use the AI properly without being over- or under-reliant on it. Reliance calibration cues (RCCs) communicate an AI's capability to users, resulting in optimizing their reliance on it. Previous studies have typically focused on continuously presenting RCCs, and although providing an excessive amount of RCCs is sometimes problematic, limited consideration has been given to the question of how an AI can selectively provide RCCs. This paper proposes vPred-RC, an algorithm in which an AI decides whether to provide an RCC and which RCC to provide. It evaluates the influence of an RCC on user reliance with a cognitive model that predicts whether a human will assign a task to an AI agent with or without an RCC. We tested vPred-RC in a human-AI collaborative task called the collaborative CAPTCHA (CC) task. First, our reliance prediction model was trained on a dataset of human task assignments for the CC task and found to achieve 83.5% accuracy. We further evaluated vPred-RC's dynamic RCC selection in a user study. As a result, the RCCs selected by vPred-RC enabled participants to more accurately assign tasks to an AI when and only when the AI succeeded compared with randomly selected ones, suggesting that vPred-RC can successfully calibrate human reliance with a reduced number of RCCs. The selective presentation of RCCs has the potential to enhance the efficiency of collaboration between humans and AIs with fewer communication costs.",,第1页.xls
191,Human-AI collaboration enables more empathic conversations in text-based peer-to-peer mental health support,2023,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling systems that augment and collaborate with humans to perform simple, mechanistic tasks such as scheduling meetings and grammar-checking text. However, such human-AI collaboration poses challenges for more complex tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to the difficulties that AI systems face in navigating complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop HAILEY, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate HAILEY in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on TalkLife (N = 300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that our human-AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.6% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger, 38.9% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyse the human-AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social and high-stakes tasks such as empathic conversations.AI language modelling and generation approaches have developed fast in the last decade, opening promising new directions in human-AI collaboration. An AI-in-the loop conversational system called HAILEY is developed to empower peer supporters in providing empathic responses to mental health support seekers.",,第1页.xls

We focus on chat-based interactions powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), because of their increasing availability and extensive use for knowledge-based and creative work. We present four areas in which the different temporal characteristics of humans and of LLMs influence the interaction between them: interaction pace, temporal context, continuity over time, and rhythm and attunement. In each area we discuss these differences and their pitfalls and potentials, point to current choices made by the designers of LLM interfaces, make initial speculations about possible design opportunities, and suggest open research questions in the context of work. Finally, we propose a number of LLM agent personas that integrate different temporal characteristics into a coherent interaction model in a work-based collaboration.",,第1页.xls
194,Numerical simulations of AI-human interaction using quintic mean-field Ising model,2024,"The growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in our society presents both benefits and challenges. To delve deeper into this, we suggest a simulation model that mimics a human-AI ecosystem. This model considers various factors, such as biased actions and multiple-agent interactions ranging from two to five agents. For instance, it includes situations where four humans engage with AI or where four AI systems interact with a human. Our main goal is to investigate how the number of AI systems in the ecosystem influences its dynamics. Our findings revealed that even slight variations in the presence of AI can cause significant changes in the system's behavior. These shifts can push the system to distinct opposing outcomes or leave it in a state of uncertainty.",,第1页.xls
195,Decision Theoretic Foundations for Experiments Evaluating Human Decisions [arXiv],2024,"Decision-making with information displays is a key focus of research in areas like explainable AI, human-AI teaming, and data visualization. However, what constitutes a decision problem, and what is required for an experiment to be capable of concluding that human decisions are flawed in some way, remain open to speculation. We present a widely applicable definition of a decision problem synthesized from statistical decision theory and information economics. We argue that to attribute loss in human performance to forms of bias, an experiment must provide participants with the information that a rational agent would need to identify the normative decision. We evaluate the extent to which recent evaluations of decision-making from the literature on AI-assisted decisions achieve this criteria. We find that only 6 (17\%) of 35 studies that claim to identify biased behavior present participants with sufficient information to characterize their behavior as deviating from good decision-making. We motivate the value of studying well-defined decision problems by describing a characterization of performance losses they allow us to conceive. In contrast, the ambiguities of a poorly communicated decision problem preclude normative interpretation. We conclude with recommendations for practice.",,第1页.xls
196,Full-body gesture interaction with improvisational narrative agents,2012,"Interactive narrative research strives to allow humans and intelligent agents toco-createnarratives in real-time as equal contributors. While intelligent agents can interact with humans through expressive embodied representations, typical interactive narrative interfaces provide humans no way to reciprocate with embodied communication of their own. This disparity in interaction capabilities has been informally discussed as thehuman puppet problem. Improvisational theatre (improv) provides a real-world analogue to embodied co-creative interactive narrative experiences. This paper presents an overview of a system for combining improvisational acting with full-body motions to support human-AI co-creation of interactive narratives. The human begins an improvised narrative with an AI improviser while an intelligent avatar mediates interaction and gives the human an embodied presence in the scene.",,第1页.xls
197,An interaction framework for studying co-creative AI [arXiv],2019,"Machine learning has been applied to a number of creative, design-oriented tasks. However, it remains unclear how to best empower human users with these machine learning approaches, particularly those users without technical expertise. In this paper we propose a general framework for turn-based interaction between human users and AI agents designed to support human creativity, called co-creative systems. The framework can be used to better understand the space of possible designs of co-creative systems and reveal future research directions. We demonstrate how to apply this framework in conjunction with a pair of recent human subject studies, comparing between the four human-AI systems employed in these studies and generating hypotheses towards future studies.",,第1页.xls
198,Toward Human-AI Alignment in Large-Scale Multi-Player Games [arXiv],2024,"Achieving human-AI alignment in complex multi-agent games is crucial for creating trustworthy AI agents that enhance gameplay. We propose a method to evaluate this alignment using an interpretable task-sets framework, focusing on high-level behavioral tasks instead of low-level policies. Our approach has three components. First, we analyze extensive human gameplay data from Xbox's Bleeding Edge (100K+ games), uncovering behavioral patterns in a complex task space. This task space serves as a basis set for a behavior manifold capturing interpretable axes: fight-flight, explore-exploit, and solo-multi-agent. Second, we train an AI agent to play Bleeding Edge using a Generative Pretrained Causal Transformer and measure its behavior. Third, we project human and AI gameplay to the proposed behavior manifold to compare and contrast. This allows us to interpret differences in policy as higher-level behavioral concepts, e.g., we find that while human players exhibit variability in fight-flight and explore-exploit behavior, AI players tend towards uniformity. Furthermore, AI agents predominantly engage in solo play, while humans often engage in cooperative and competitive multi-agent patterns. These stark differences underscore the need for interpretable evaluation, design, and integration of AI in human-aligned applications. Our study advances the alignment discussion in AI and especially generative AI research, offering a measurable framework for interpretable human-agent alignment in multiplayer gaming.",,第1页.xls

200,Instrumental Robots,2020,"Advances in artificial intelligence research allow us to build fairly sophisticated agents: robots and computer programs capable of acting and deciding on their own (in some sense). These systems raise questions about who is responsible when something goes wrong-when such systems harm or kill humans. In a recent paper, Sven Nyholm has suggested that, because current AI will likely possess what we might call supervised agency, the theory of responsibility for individual agency is the wrong place to look for an answer to the question of responsibility. Instead, or so argues Nyholm, because supervised agency is a form of collaborative agency-of acting together-the right place to look is the theory of collaborative responsibility-responsibility in cases of acting together. This paper concedes that current AI will possess supervised agency, but argues that it is nevertheless wrong to think of the relevant human-AI interactions as a form of collaborative agency and, hence, that responsibility in cases of collaborative agency is not the right place to look for the responsibility-grounding relation in human-AI interactions. It also suggests that the right place to look for this responsibility-grounding relation in human-AI interactions is the use of certain sorts of agents as instruments.",,第1页.xls
201,Perceptions of Interaction Dynamics in Co-Creative AI: a comparative study of interaction modalities in drawcto,2024,"This paper explores how different interaction modalities with AI agents affect human perception of the co-creative process. We utilize the Wizard of Oz methodology within Drawcto, a co-creative drawing system, to examine co-creativity across three scenarios: human-human, human-robot, and human-software interactions. Using a mixed-methods approach, we combined insights using the Observable Creative Sensemaking (OCSM) method with data from structured interviews. The study involved 20 participants engaging in a collaborative drawing task under each interaction scenario. Key findings reveal an average OCSM curve indicative of typical human-human interactions, varied themes in human-AI collaboration, and a notable influence of AI embodiment on participant perceptions, with the robot interface resembling human-human collaboration more closely than the software interface. Overall, this research offers valuable insights into how different interaction modalities influence the perceived role of AI in the co-creative process and provides design considerations for enhancing human-AI co-creative interactions.",,第1页.xls
202,The Emerging Era Of Human-Ai Interaction: Keynote Address,2022,"At present, a major paradigm shift is taking place where computers are no longer solely executing human instructions but rather, they become agents with decision making capabilities through their AI empowered software. This leads to a whole emerging era of Human-AI Interaction which is increasingly affecting working and everyday lives of all people. The promise of AI is big in assisting humans through all sorts of interactive applications including smartphones, wearables, self-driving cars, smart homes, and offices, virtual assistants as well as contributing to the advancements of human achievements in science and arts. AI alleviates human cognitive overload both on the use of complex software and in difficult problem-solving situations, it provides orientation in the vast cyberspace navigation, it offers enlightening visions in huge accumulated human knowledge all through deep learning, machine learning, decision making methods, cognitive theories, fuzzy logic and more but with a degree of uncertainty and possible consequent errors in results. However, in this new kind of interaction, the human nature, capabilities, understanding, feelings, and needs remain unchanged and constitute the most important issue in the two-part dialogue, urging for more research on trustworthy and explainable AI.This paper aims to highlight important advantages and gains and discuss consequent challenges of the emerging human-AI interaction by presenting a critical overview of the state-of-the-art as well as the author's personal point of view as to how this dialogue can acquire more explainability and trustworthiness while preserving usability.",,第1页.xls
203,Designing for Confidence: The Impact of Visualizing Artificial Intelligence Decisions,2022,"Explainable artificial intelligence aims to bring transparency to artificial intelligence (AI) systems by translating, simplifying, and visualizing its decisions. While society remains skeptical about AI systems, studies show that transparent and explainable AI systems can help improve the Human-AI trust relationship. This manuscript presents two studies that assess three AI decision visualization attribution models that manipulate morphological clarity (MC) and two information presentation-order methods to determine each visualization's impact on the Human-AI trust relationship through increased confidence and cognitive fit (CF). The first study, N = 206 (Avg. age = 37.87 +/- 10.51, Male = 123), utilized information presentation methods and visualizations delivered through an online experiment to explore trust in AI by asking participants to complete a visual decision-making task. The second study, N = 19 (24.9 +/- 8.3 years old, Male = 10), utilized eye-tracking technology and the same stimuli presentation methods to investigate if cognitive load, inferred through pupillometry measures, mediated the confidence-trust relationship. The results indicate that low MC positively impacts Human-AI trust and that the presentation order of information within an interface in terms of adjacency further influences user trust in AI. We conclude that while adjacency and MC significantly affect cognitive load, cognitive load alone does not mediate the confidence-trust relationship. Our findings interpreted through a combination of CF, situation awareness, and ecological interface design have implications for the design of future AI systems, which may facilitate better collaboration between humans and AI-based decision agents.",,第1页.xls
204,"It Seems Smart, but It Acts Stupid: Development of Trust in AI Advice in a Repeated Legal Decision-Making Task",2023,"Humans increasingly interact with AI systems, and successful interactions rely on individuals trusting such systems (when appropriate). Considering that trust is fragile and often cannot be restored quickly, we focus on how trust develops over time in a human-AI-interaction scenario. In a 2x2 between-subject experiment, we test how model accuracy (high vs. low) and type of explanation (human-like vs. not) affect trust in AI over time. We study a complex decision-making task in which individuals estimate jail time for 20 criminal law cases with AI advice. Results show that trust is significantly higher for high-accuracy models. Also, behavioral trust does not decline, and subjective trust even increases significantly with high accuracy. Human-like explanations did not generally affect trust but boosted trust in high-accuracy models.",,第1页.xls

207,"The Effects of Expertise, Humanness, and Congruence on Perceived Trust, Warmth, Competence and Intention to Use Embodied AI",2024,"Even though people imagine different embodiments when asked which AI they would like to work with, most studies investigate trust in AI systems without specific physical appearances. This study aims to close this gap by combining influencing factors of trust to analyze their impact on the perceived trustworthiness, warmth, and competence of an embodied AI. We recruited 68 participants who observed three co-working scenes with an embodied AI, presented as expert/novice (expertise), human/AI (humanness), or congruent/slightly incongruent to the environment (congruence). Our results show that the expertise condition had the largest impact on trust, acceptance, and perceived warmth and competence. When controlled for perceived competence, the humanness of the AI and the congruence of its embodiment to the environment also influence acceptance. The results show that besides expertise and the perceived competence of the AI, other design variables are relevant for successful human-AI interaction, especially when the AI is embodied.",,第1页.xls
208,A FRAMEWORK TO STUDY HUMAN-AI COLLABORATIVE DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION,2021,"This paper presents a framework to describe and explain human-machine collaborative design focusing on Design Space Exploration (DSE), which is a popular method used in the early design of complex systems with roots in the well-known design as exploration paradigm. The human designer and a cognitive design assistant are both modeled as intelligent agents, with an internal state (e.g., motivation, cognitive workload), a knowledge state (separated in domain, design process, and problem specific knowledge), an estimated state of the world (i.e., status of the design task) and of the other agent, a hierarchy of goals (short-term and long-term, design and learning goals) and a set of long-term attributes (e.g., Kirton's Adaption-Innovation inventory style, risk aversion). The framework emphasizes the relation between design goals and learning goals in DSE, as previously highlighted in the literature (e.g., Concept-Knowledge theory, LinD model) and builds upon the theory of common ground from human-computer interaction (e.g., shared goals, plans, attention) as a building block to develop successful assistants and interactions. Recent studies in human-AI collaborative DSE are reviewed from the lens of the proposed framework, and some new research questions are identified. This framework can help advance the theory of human-AI collaborative design by helping design researchers build promising hypotheses, and design studies to test these hypotheses that consider most relevant factors.",,第1页.xls

Although emotional expressions are considered to be honest and credible signals in human-human negotiations, it is still unclear how emotional expressions encoding preference and limits affect the outcome of human-AI negotiations. In the present study, we designed that preferences learning phase of counterpart AI agent from emotional expressions in pre-play communication and four-issue ultimatum game with an AI agent. Participants are going to experience either one phase or two phases of preplay communication before deciding on their final offer. We hypothesized that participants who experienced two phases, i.e., the preference learning phase in addition to a phase in which simultaneous inference of preferences and limits was possible, were able to reach more integrative solutions than those who did not.",,第1页.xls

We introduce 'ORIBA', a customizable AI chatbot that enables illustrators to converse with their OCs. This approach allows artists to not only receive responses from their OCs but also to observe their inner monologues and behavior. Despite the existing tension between artists and AI, our study explores innovative collaboration methods that are inspiring to illustrators. By examining the impact of AI on the creative process and the boundaries of authorship, we aim to enhance human-AI interactions in creative fields, with potential applications extending beyond illustration to interactive storytelling and more.",,第1页.xls
211,Optimizing Delegation in Collaborative Human-AI Hybrid Teams [arXiv],2024,"When humans and autonomous systems operate together as what we refer to as a hybrid team, we of course wish to ensure the team operates successfully and effectively. We refer to team members as agents. In our proposed framework, we address the case of hybrid teams in which, at any time, only one team member (the control agent) is authorized to act as control for the team. To determine the best selection of a control agent, we propose the addition of an AI manager (via Reinforcement Learning) which learns as an outside observer of the team. The manager learns a model of behavior linking observations of agent performance and the environment/world the team is operating in, and from these observations makes the most desirable selection of a control agent. We restrict the manager task by introducing a set of constraints. The manager constraints indicate acceptable team operation, so a violation occurs if the team enters a condition which is unacceptable and requires manager intervention. To ensure minimal added complexity or potential inefficiency for the team, the manager should attempt to minimize the number of times the team reaches a constraint violation and requires subsequent manager intervention. Therefore our manager is optimizing its selection of authorized agents to boost overall team performance while minimizing the frequency of manager intervention. We demonstrate our manager performance in a simulated driving scenario representing the case of a hybrid team of agents composed of a human driver and autonomous driving system. We perform experiments for our driving scenario with interfering vehicles, indicating the need for collision avoidance and proper speed control. Our results indicate a positive impact of our manager, with some cases resulting in increased team performance up to ~187% that of the best solo agent performance.",,第1页.xls

213,EFFECT OF REFLECTION AND INCUBATION ON ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-ASSISTED DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION,2023,"Design space exploration is a method for gaining insights into a space of design alternatives to make important design decisions. Current research in design space exploration is studying the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents (called cognitive assistants) to provide cognitive support to human designers and help them obtain insights from large datasets. This work explores the collaborative exploration of design spaces between human designers and AI cognitive assistants. A human subject study was conducted to 1) investigate whether cognitive interventions during a design task, specifically a question-based reflection period or an incubation period, influence the way designers collaborate with cognitive assistants; and 2) characterize the effects of those interventions on the design space exploration process and outcomes (performance and designer learning). The study aims to determine whether cognitive interventions that prompt designers to reflect on their collaboration with the AI agent could improve the quality of their collaboration. The results indicate that the two intervention methods have opposing effects on design performance. Participants who had an incubation period amid design space exploration improved their design performance significantly more than participants who had a self-reflection period amid design space exploration. Participants who had different interventions during the design task exhibited different forms of human-AI collaboration which possibly explain the opposing effects of reflection and incubation periods on their design performance. The findings could serve as a basis for the development of AI-assisted design tools that guide designers toward more effective human-AI collaboration.",,第1页.xls
214,It Is Your Turn: Collaborative Ideation with a Co-Creative Robot through Sketch,2020,"Co-creative systems have been widely explored in the field of computational creativity. However, existing AI partners of these systems are mostly virtual agents. As sketching on paper with embodied robots could be more engaging for designers' early-stage ideation and collaborative practices, we envision the possibility of Cobbie, a mobile robot that ideates iteratively with designers by generating creative and diverse sketches. To evaluate the differences in co-creativity and user experience between the co-creative robots and virtual agents, we conducted a comparative experiment and analyzed the data collected from quantitative scales, observation, and semi-structured interview. The results reveal that Cobbie is more satisfying in motivating exploration, provoking unexpected ideas and engaging designers in the collaborative ideation process. Based on these findings, we discussed the prospects of co-creative robots for future developments of human-AI collaborative systems.",,第1页.xls

We have been particularly interested in research on agents representing human users in negotiating deals with other human and autonomous agents [12;16;18]. Here we present the design for the conversational aspect of our agent entry into the HUMAINE League of the 2020 Automated Negotiation Agent Competition (ANAC). We discuss how our agent utilizes conversational and negotiation strategies, that mimic those used in human negotiations, to maximize its utility as a simulated street vendor. We leverage verbal influence tactics, offer pricing, and increasing human convenience to entice the buyer, build trust and discourage exploitation.

These limitations motivate effective methods for human-machine collaboration. Our work makes two primary contributions. We thoroughly experiment with an artificial prediction market model to understand the effects of market parameters on model performance for benchmark classification tasks. We then demonstrate, through simulation, the impact of exogenous agents in the market, where these exogenous agents represent primitive human behaviors. This work lays the foundation for a novel set of hybrid human-AI machine learning algorithms.",,第1页.xls
217,Balancing Performance and Human Autonomy With Implicit Guidance Agent.,2021,"The human-agent team, which is a problem in which humans and autonomous agents collaborate to achieve one task, is typical in human-AI collaboration. For effective collaboration, humans want to have an effective plan, but in realistic situations, they might have difficulty calculating the best plan due to cognitive limitations. In this case, guidance from an agent that has many computational resources may be useful. However, if an agent guides the human behavior explicitly, the human may feel that they have lost autonomy and are being controlled by the agent. We therefore investigated implicit guidance offered by means of an agent's behavior. With this type of guidance, the agent acts in a way that makes it easy for the human to find an effective plan for a collaborative task, and the human can then improve the plan. Since the human improves their plan voluntarily, he or she maintains autonomy. We modeled a collaborative agent with implicit guidance by integrating the Bayesian Theory of Mind into existing collaborative-planning algorithms and demonstrated through a behavioral experiment that implicit guidance is effective for enabling humans to maintain a balance between improving their plans and retaining autonomy.",,第1页.xls

221,AI-enhanced Collective Intelligence: The State of the Art and Prospects,2024,"The current societal challenges exceed the capacity of human individual or collective effort alone. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives is poised to vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, when synergized, can achieve a level of collective intelligence that surpasses the collective capabilities of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising a cognition layer, a physical layer, and an information layer. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. The interplay among these agents shapes the overall structure and dynamics of the system. We explore how agents' diversity and interactions influence the system's collective intelligence. Furthermore, we present an analysis of real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by addressing the potential challenges in AI-enhanced collective intelligence and offer perspectives on future developments in this field.",,第1页.xls
222,A Prototype Hybrid Prediction Market for Estimating Replicability of Published Work,2023,"We present a prototype hybrid prediction market and demonstrate the avenue it represents for meaningful human-AI collaboration. We build on prior work proposing artificial prediction markets as a novel machine learning algorithm. In an artificial prediction market, trained AI agents (bot traders) buy and sell outcomes of future events. Classification decisions can be framed as outcomes of future events, and accordingly, the price of an asset corresponding to a given classification outcome can be taken as a proxy for the systems confidence in that decision. By embedding human participants in these markets alongside bot traders, we can bring together insights from both. In this paper, we detail pilot studies with prototype hybrid markets for the prediction of replication study outcomes. We highlight challenges and opportunities, share insights from semi-structured interviews with hybrid market participants, and outline a vision for ongoing and future work.",,第1页.xls

As builders and users of such agents it is unclear what parameters we need to align on before the agents start performing tasks on our behalf. To discover these parameters, we ran a qualitative empirical research study about designing agents that can negotiate during a fictional yet relatable task of selling a camera online. We found that for an agent to perform the task successfully, humans/users and agents need to align over 6 dimensions: 1) Knowledge Schema Alignment 2) Autonomy and Agency Alignment 3) Operational Alignment and Training 4) Reputational Heuristics Alignment 5) Ethics Alignment and 6) Human Engagement Alignment. These empirical findings expand previous work related to process and specification alignment and the need for values and safety in Human-AI interactions.

224,Users’ Attachment Styles and ChatGPT Interaction: Revealing Insights into User Experiences,2024,"This study explores the relationship between users' attachment styles and their interactions with ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer), an advanced language model developed by OpenAI.As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life, it is essential to understand how individuals with different attachment styles engage with AI chatbots in order to build a better user experience that meets specific user needs and interacts with users in the most ideal way.Grounded in attachment theory from psychology, we are exploring the influence of attachment style on users' interaction with ChatGPT, bridging a significant gap in understanding human-AI interaction.Contrary to expectations, attachment styles did not have a significant impact on ChatGPT usage or reasons for engagement. Regardless of their attachment styles, hesitated to fully trust ChatGPT with critical information, emphasizing the need to address trust issues in AI systems. Additionally, this study uncovers complex patterns of attachment styles, demonstrating their influence on interaction patterns between users and ChatGPT. By focusing on the distinctive dynamics between users and ChatGPT, our aim is to uncover how attachment styles influence these interactions, guiding the development of AI chatbots for personalized user experiences. The introduction of the Perceived Partner Responsiveness Scale serves as a valuable tool to evaluate users' perceptions of ChatGPT's role, shedding light on the anthropomorphism of AI. This study contributes to the wider discussion on human-AI relationships, emphasizing the significance of incorporating emotional intelligence into AI systems for a user-centered future.",,第1页.xls
225,When and How to Use AI in the Design Process? Implications for Human-AI Design Collaboration,2024,"As the potential for human-AI design collaboration increases, understanding the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the design process becomes more important. How does AI currently support the design process and how could it do so in the future? To answer this question, we categorized existing AI design support systems (DSS) according to the Double-Diamond design process model, and found that they are mostly used in the later stages of the design process, focusing on generating design solutions. In contrast, very few systems focus on the early stages of the process, which include discovering and defining design problems. To explore this finding's alignment with designers' expectations in real-world design, we present a case study involving emerging AI technologies such as ChatGPT and robots. This study proposes that AI agents can potentially assist designers by providing inspirations, defining design problems with constraints, offering grounded metaphors, and exploring design materials.",,第1页.xls

To better understand how access to conversational AI affects productivity and trust, we conducted a mixed-methods, task-based user study, observing 76 software engineers (N=76) as they completed a programming exam with and without access to Bard. Effects on performance, efficiency, satisfaction, and trust vary depending on user expertise, question type (open-ended solve questions vs. definitive search questions), and measurement type (demonstrated vs. self-reported). Our findings include evidence of automation complacency, increased reliance on the AI over the course of the task, and increased performance for novices on solve-type questions when using the AI. We discuss common behaviors, design recommendations, and impact considerations to improve collaborations with conversational AI.",,第1页.xls
227,Efficient Human-AI Coordination via Preparatory Language-based Convention [arXiv],2023,"Developing intelligent agents capable of seamless coordination with humans is a critical step towards achieving artificial general intelligence. Existing methods for human-AI coordination typically train an agent to coordinate with a diverse set of policies or with human models fitted from real human data. However, the massively diverse styles of human behavior present obstacles for AI systems with constrained capacity, while high quality human data may not be readily available in real-world scenarios. In this study, we observe that prior to coordination, humans engage in communication to establish conventions that specify individual roles and actions, making their coordination proceed in an orderly manner. Building upon this observation, we propose employing the large language model (LLM) to develop an action plan (or equivalently, a convention) that effectively guides both human and AI. By inputting task requirements, human preferences, the number of agents, and other pertinent information into the LLM, it can generate a comprehensive convention that facilitates a clear understanding of tasks and responsibilities for all parties involved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that decomposing the convention formulation problem into sub-problems with multiple new sessions being sequentially employed and human feedback, will yield a more efficient coordination convention. Experimental evaluations conducted in the Overcooked-AI environment, utilizing a human proxy model, highlight the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing learning-based approaches. When coordinating with real humans, our method achieves better alignment with human preferences and an average performance improvement of 15% compared to the state-of-the-art.",,第1页.xls
228,Assessing Trust in Active Learning Systems: Insights from Query Policies and Uncertainty Visualization,2024,"Active learning (AL) systems have become increasingly popular for various applications in machine learning (ML), including medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and geospatial analysis. These systems rely on inputs dynamically queried from people to enhance classification. Ensuring appropriate analyst trust in these systems presents a significant obstacle as analyst over- or underreliance may adversely affect a given application. Common AL strategies enhance classification models by asking analysts to provide labels for data points with the highest degree of uncertainty. However, such model-centric policies do not consider potential priming effects on the analyst and how they will affect people's trust in the system post-training. We present an empirical study assessing how AL query policies and visualizations that enhance transparency in a classifier's decisions influence trust in automated image classifiers. We found that query policy may significantly influence an analyst's perception of system capabilities, while the level of visual transparency into classifier certainty may influence an analyst's ability to perform a classification task. Our study informs the design of interactive labeling systems to help mitigate the effects of overreliance and calibrate appropriate trust in automated systems.",,第1页.xls
229,"When AI Fails, Who Do We Blame? Attributing Responsibility in Human-AI Interactions",2024,"While previous studies of trust in artificial intelligence have focused on perceived user trust, the paper examines how an external agent (e.g., an auditor) assigns responsibility, perceives trustworthiness, and explains the successes and failures of AI. In two experiments, participants (university students) reviewed scenarios about automation failures and assigned perceived responsibility, trustworthiness, and preferred explanation type. Participants' cumulative responsibility ratings for three agents (operators, developers, and AI) exceeded 100%, implying that participants were not attributing trust in a wholly rational manner, and that trust in the AI might serve as a proxy for trust in the human software developer. Dissociation between responsibility and trustworthiness suggested that participants used different cues, with the kind of technology and perceived autonomy affecting judgments. Finally, we additionally found that the kind of explanation used to understand a situation differed based on whether the AI succeeded or failed.",,第1页.xls
230,Expedient Assistance and Consequential Misunderstanding: Envisioning an Operationalized Mutual Theory of Mind,2024,"Design fictions allow us to prototype the future. They enable us to interrogate emerging or non-existent technologies and examine their implications. We present three design fictions that probe the potential consequences of operationalizing a mutual theory of mind (MToM) between human users and one (or more) AI agents. We use these fictions to explore many aspects of MToM, including how models of the other party are shaped through interaction, how discrepancies between these models lead to breakdowns, and how models of a human's knowledge and skills enable AI agents to act in their stead. We examine these aspects through two lenses: a utopian lens in which MToM enhances human-human interactions and leads to synergistic human-AI collaborations, and a dystopian lens in which a faulty or misaligned MToM leads to problematic outcomes. Our work provides an aspirational vision for human-centered MToM research while simultaneously warning of the consequences when implemented incorrectly.",,第1页.xls
231,PECAN: Leveraging Policy Ensemble for Context-Aware Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination [arXiv],2023,"Zero-shot human-AI coordination holds the promise of collaborating with humans without human data. Prevailing methods try to train the ego agent with a population of partners via self-play. However, this kind of method suffers from two problems: 1) The diversity of a population with finite partners is limited, thereby limiting the capacity of the trained ego agent to collaborate with a novel human; 2) Current methods only provide a common best response for every partner in the population, which may result in poor zero-shot coordination performance with a novel partner or humans. To address these issues, we first propose the policy ensemble method to increase the diversity of partners in the population, and then develop a context-aware method enabling the ego agent to analyze and identify the partner's potential policy primitives so that it can take different actions accordingly. In this way, the ego agent is able to learn more universal cooperative behaviors for collaborating with diverse partners. We conduct experiments on the Overcooked environment, and evaluate the zero-shot human-AI coordination performance of our method with both behavior-cloned human proxies and real humans. The results demonstrate that our method significantly increases the diversity of partners and enables ego agents to learn more diverse behaviors than baselines, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance in all scenarios.",,第1页.xls

233,Partner-Aware Algorithms in Decentralized Cooperative Bandit Teams,2022,"When humans collaborate with each other, they often make decisions by observing others and considering the consequences that their actions may have on the entire team, instead of greedily doing what is best for just themselves. We would like our AI agents to effectively collaborate in a similar way by capturing a model of their partners. In this work, we propose and analyze a decentralized Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with coupled rewards as an abstraction of more general multi-agent collaboration. We demonstrate that naive extensions of single-agent optimal MAB algorithms fail when applied for decentralized bandit teams. Instead, we propose a Partner-Aware strategy for joint sequential decision-making that extends the well-known single-agent Upper Confidence Bound algorithm. We analytically show that our proposed strategy achieves logarithmic regret, and provide extensive experiments involving human-AI and human-robot collaboration to validate our theoretical findings. Our results show that the proposed partner-aware strategy outperforms other known methods, and our human subject studies suggest humans prefer to collaborate with AI agents implementing our partner-aware strategy.",,第1页.xls
234,Concept-Guided LLM Agents for Human-AI Safety Codesign,2024,"Generative AI is increasingly important in software engineering, including safety engineering, where its use ensures that software does not cause harm to people. This also leads to high quality requirements for generative AI. Therefore, the simplistic use of Large Language Models (LLMs) alone will not meet these quality demands. It is crucial to develop more advanced and sophisticated approaches that can effectively address the complexities and safety concerns of software systems. Ultimately, humans must understand and take responsibility for the suggestions provided by generative AI to ensure system safety. To this end, we present an efficient, hybrid strategy to leverage LLMs for safety analysis and Human-AI codesign. In particular, we develop a customized LLM agent that uses elements of prompt engineering, heuristic reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation to solve tasks associated with predefined safety concepts, in interaction with a system model graph. The reasoning is guided by a cascade of micro-decisions that help preserve structured information. We further suggest a graph verbalization which acts as an intermediate representation of the system model to facilitate LLM-graph interactions. Selected pairs of prompts and responses relevant for safety analytics illustrate our method for the use case of a simplified automated driving system.",,第1页.xls
235,A Bayesian Account of Measures of Interpretability in Human-AI Interaction [arXiv],2020,"Existing approaches for the design of interpretable agent behavior consider different measures of interpretability in isolation. In this paper we posit that, in the design and deployment of human-aware agents in the real world, notions of interpretability are just some among many considerations; and the techniques developed in isolation lack two key properties to be useful when considered together: they need to be able to 1) deal with their mutually competing properties; and 2) an open world where the human is not just there to interpret behavior in one specific form. To this end, we consider three well-known instances of interpretable behavior studied in existing literature - namely, explicability, legibility, and predictability - and propose a revised model where all these behaviors can be meaningfully modeled together. We will highlight interesting consequences of this unified model and motivate, through results of a user study, why this revision is necessary.",,第1页.xls
236,Fostering Collective Intelligence in Human-AI Collaboration: Laying the Groundwork for COHUMAIN.,2023,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered machines are increasingly mediating our work and many of our managerial, economic, and cultural interactions. While technology enhances individual capability in many ways, how do we know that the sociotechnical system as a whole, consisting of a complex web of hundreds of human-machine interactions, is exhibiting collective intelligence? Research on human-machine interactions has been conducted within different disciplinary silos, resulting in social science models that underestimate technology and vice versa. Bringing together these different perspectives and methods at this juncture is critical. To truly advance our understanding of this important and quickly evolving area, we need vehicles to help research connect across disciplinary boundaries. This paper advocates for establishing an interdisciplinary research domain-Collective Human-Machine Intelligence (COHUMAIN). It outlines a research agenda for a holistic approach to designing and developing the dynamics of sociotechnical systems. In illustrating the kind of approach, we envision in this domain, we describe recent work on a sociocognitive architecture, the transactive systems model of collective intelligence, that articulates the critical processes underlying the emergence and maintenance of collective intelligence and extend it to human-AI systems. We connect this with synergistic work on a compatible cognitive architecture, instance-based learning theory and apply it to the design of AI agents that collaborate with humans. We present this work as a call to researchers working on related questions to not only engage with our proposal but also develop their own sociocognitive architectures and unlock the real potential of human-machine intelligence.",,第1页.xls
237,Human-AI ecosystem with abrupt changes as a function of the composition [arXiv],2022,"The progressive advent of artificial intelligence machines may represent both an opportunity or a threat. In order to have an idea of what is coming we propose a model that simulate a Human-AI ecosystem. In particular we consider systems where agents present biases, peer-to-peer interactions and also three body interactions that are crucial and describe two humans interacting with an artificial agent and two artificial intelligence agents interacting with a human. We focus our analysis by exploring how the relative fraction of artificial intelligence agents affect that ecosystem. We find evidence that for suitable values of the interaction parameters, arbitrarily small changes in such percentage may trigger dramatic changes for the system that can be either in one of the two polarised states or in an undecided state.",,第1页.xls
238,A Situation Awareness Perspective on Human-AI Interaction: Tensions and Opportunities,2023,"With the emergent focus on human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI), research is required to understand the humanistic aspects of AI design, identify the mechanisms through which user concerns may be alleviated, thereby positively influencing AI adoption. To fill this void, we introduce Situation Awareness (SA) as a conceptual framework for considering human-AI interaction (HAII). We argue that SA is an appropriate and valuable theoretical lens through which to decompose and view HAII as hierarchical layers that allow for closer inquiry and discovery. Furthermore, we illustrate why the SA perspective is particularly relevant to the current need to understand HCAI by identifying three tensions inherent in AI design and explaining how an SA-oriented approach may help alleviate these tensions. We posit that users' enactment of SA will mitigate some negative impacts of AI systems on user experience, improve human agency during AI system use, and promote more efficient and effective in-situ decision-making.",,第1页.xls
239,The Situation Awareness Framework for Explainable AI (SAFE-AI) and Human Factors Considerations for XAI Systems,2022,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have drawn attention to the need for AI systems to be understandable to human users. The explainable AI (XAI) literature aims to enhance human understanding and human-AI team performance by providing users with necessary information about AI system behavior. Simultaneously, the human factors literature has long addressed important considerations that contribute to human performance, including how to determine human informational needs, human workload, and human trust in autonomous systems. Drawing from the human factors literature, we propose the Situation Awareness Framework for Explainable AI (SAFE-AI), a three-level framework for the development and evaluation of explanations about AI system behavior. Our proposed levels of XAI are based on the informational needs of human users, which can be determined using the levels of situation awareness (SA) framework from the human factors literature. Based on our levels of XAI framework, we also suggest a method for assessing the effectiveness of XAI systems. We further detail human workload considerations for determining the content and frequency of explanations as well as metrics that can be used to assess human workload. Finally, we discuss the importance of appropriately calibrating user trust in AI systems through explanations along with other trust-related considerations for XAI, and we detail metrics that can be used to evaluate user trust in these systems.",,第1页.xls
240,Towards Collaborative Plan Acquisition through Theory of Mind Modeling in Situated Dialogue [arXiv],2023,"Collaborative tasks often begin with partial task knowledge and incomplete initial plans from each partner. To complete these tasks, agents need to engage in situated communication with their partners and coordinate their partial plans towards a complete plan to achieve a joint task goal. While such collaboration seems effortless in a human-human team, it is highly challenging for human-AI collaboration. To address this limitation, this paper takes a step towards collaborative plan acquisition, where humans and agents strive to learn and communicate with each other to acquire a complete plan for joint tasks. Specifically, we formulate a novel problem for agents to predict the missing task knowledge for themselves and for their partners based on rich perceptual and dialogue history. We extend a situated dialogue benchmark for symmetric collaborative tasks in a 3D blocks world and investigate computational strategies for plan acquisition. Our empirical results suggest that predicting the partner's missing knowledge is a more viable approach than predicting one's own. We show that explicit modeling of the partner's dialogue moves and mental states produces improved and more stable results than without. These results provide insight for future AI agents that can predict what knowledge their partner is missing and, therefore, can proactively communicate such information to help their partner acquire such missing knowledge toward a common understanding of joint tasks.",,第1页.xls
241,Motivation and Design of the Conversational Components of DraftAgent for Human-Agent Negotiation,2020,"In sync with the significant interest in industry and the general populace about future potential of human-AI collaboration [14], academic researchers have been pushing the frontier of new modalities of peer-level and ad-hoc human agent collaboration [4,15]. We have been particularly interested in research on agents representing human users in negotiating deals with other human and autonomous agents [6,11,13]. We present the design motivation and key components of the conversational aspect of our agent entry into the Human-Agent League(HAL) (http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~katfuji/ANAC2020/cfp/ham_cfp.pdf )of the 2020 Automated Negotiation Agent Competition (ANAC). We explore how language can be used to promote human-agent collaboration even in the domain of a competitive negotiation.

242,Optimizing Risk-averse Human-AI Hybrid Teams,2024,"We anticipate increased instances of humans and AI systems working together in what we refer to as a hybrid team. The increase in collaboration is expected as AI systems gain proficiency and their adoption becomes more widespread. However, their behavior is not error-free, making hybrid teams a very suitable solution. As such, we consider methods for improving performance for these teams of humans and AI systems. For hybrid teams, we will refer to both the humans and AI systems as agents. To improve team performance over that seen for agents operating individually, we propose a manager which learns, through a standard Reinforcement Learning scheme, how to best delegate, over time, the responsibility of taking a decision to any of the agents. We further guide the manager's learning so they also minimize how many changes in delegation are made resulting from undesirable team behavior. We demonstrate the optimality of our manager's performance in several grid environments which include failure states which terminate an episode and should be avoided. We perform our experiments with teams of agents with varying degrees of acceptable risk, in the form of proximity to a failure state, and measure the manager's ability to make effective delegation decisions with respect to its own risk-based constraints, then compare these to the optimal decisions. Our results show our manager can successfully learn desirable delegations which result in team paths near/exactly optimal with respect to path length and number of delegations.",,第1页.xls
243,Enhancing Human-AI (H-AI) Collaboration On Design Tasks Using An Interactive Text/Voice Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agent,2022,"In this presentation, we demonstrate a way to develop a class of AI systems, the Disruptive Interjector (DI), which observe what a human is doing, then interject with suggestions that aid in idea generation or problem solving in a human-AI (H-AI) team; something that goes beyond current creativity support systems by replacing a human-human (H-H) team with a H-AI one. The proposed DI is distinct from tutors, chatbots, recommenders and other similar systems since they seek to diverge from a solution (rather than converge towards one) by encouraging consideration of other possibilities. We develop a conceptual design of the system, then present examples from deep Convolution Neural Networks[1, 7] learning models. The first example shows results from a model that was trained on an open-source dataset (publicly available online) of a community technical support chat transcripts, while the second one was trained on a design-focused dataset obtained from transcripts of experts engaged in engineering design problem solving (unavailable publicly). Based on the results from these models, we propose the necessary improvements on models and training datasets that must be resolved in order to achieve usable and reliable collaborative text/voice systems that fall in this class of AI systems.",,第1页.xls
244,Naruto Mobile: AI Sparring Partner Using Heterogeneous Deep Reinforcement Learning,2023,"Naruto Mobile is a popular mobile Fighting Game with over 100 million registered players. AI agents are deployed extensively to the game for a wide variety of applications such as level challenges and player training, which require them to fight like humans and imitate strong and weak players. Although deep reinforcement learning is an excellent approach to creating agents with diverse behaviors, it is difficult to apply to massive-scale games like Naruto Mobile which is built on a pool of more than 300 characters that have unique skills, speed, and attack range, as a traditional approach of self-play training at such scale may require a substantial computational cost and training time.In this paper, we present a new AI training approach called Heterogeneous Exploitation Self-Play (HESP) to improve AI agent generalization ability in Naruto Mobile and optimize its massive-scale self-play training so that the computational costs and train time are significantly reduced. The proposed algorithm has already been employed by the development team of Naruto Mobile to create AI agents, which, at the time of writing this paper, have been used in more than 300 million human-AI fighting matches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that deep reinforcement learning has been employed by a commercial fighting game.",,第1页.xls
245,Perceptions of Interaction Dynamics in Co-Creative AI: A Comparative Study of Interaction Modalities in Drawcto,2024,"This paper explores how different interaction modalities with AI agents affect human perception of the co-creative process. We utilize the Wizard of Oz methodology within Drawcto, a co-creative drawing system, to examine co-creativity across three scenarios: human-human, human-robot, and human-software interactions. Using a mixed-methods approach, we combined insights using the Observable Creative Sensemaking (OCSM) method with data from structured interviews. The study involved 20 participants engaging in a collaborative drawing task under each interaction scenario. Key findings reveal an average OCSM curve indicative of typical human-human interactions, varied themes in human-AI collaboration, and a notable influence of AI embodiment on participant perceptions, with the robot interface resembling human-human collaboration more closely than the software interface. Overall, this research offers valuable insights into how different interaction modalities influence the perceived role of AI in the co-creative process and provides design considerations for enhancing human-AI co-creative interactions.",,第1页.xls
246,Intelligent Squad Weapon: Challenges to Displaying and Interacting with Artificial Intelligence in Small Arms Weapon Systems,2019,"The Army plans to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) and other intelligent decision-making aids into future dismounted Warfighter systems to augment situational awareness and target acquisition capabilities. However, due to the unique constraints of dismounted operations, successful implementation of intelligent decision-making aids in dismounted systems necessitates a human-in-the-loop approach, which includes the ability for the Warfighter to provide feedback to the autonomous system. Human-in-the- loop feedback can augment current machine learning techniques by reducing the size of datasets needed to train algorithms and allow algorithms to be flexible and adaptive to changing battlespace conditions. As such, research is required to define the bidirectional interactions between man and machine in this context, to optimize human-intelligent agent teaming for the dismounted Warfighter. In this paper, we focus on a specific application of dismounted Human-AI interaction to weapon mounted target acquisition (small arms fire control systems) and discuss issues pertaining to an important component of this optimization: how intelligent information is communicated to the end user. We consider how the intelligent information is presented to the Warfighter, and what underlying cognitive and perceptual processes can be leveraged to optimize teamed decision making. Such factors are critical to the successful implementation of human-in-the-loop AI in dismounted applications and ultimately the effectiveness of intelligent decision-making aids.",,第1页.xls

248,Multi-device trust transfer: Can trust be transferred among multiple devices?,2022,"Recent advances in automation technology have increased the opportunity for collaboration between humans and multiple autonomous systems such as robots and self-driving cars. In research on autonomous system collaboration, the trust users have in autonomous systems is an important topic. Previous research suggests that the trust built by observing a task can be transferred to other tasks. However, such research did not focus on trust in multiple different devices but in one device or several of the same devices. Thus, we do not know how trust changes in an environment involving the operation of multiple different devices such as a construction site. We investigated whether trust can be transferred among multiple different devices, and investigated the effect of two factors: the similarity among multiple devices and the agency attributed to each device, on trust transfer among multiple devices. We found that the trust a user has in a device can be transferred to other devices and that attributing different agencies to each device can clarify the distinction among devices, preventing trust from transferring.",,第1页.xls
249,Symbiont AI and Embodied Symbiotic Learning,2022,"Various approaches have been explored to enable AI agents to assist human users in complex tasks. To date, these systems have been narrowly designed to tackle specific rather than general tasks, are brittle when taken outside of controlled environments, or can only be trained by technically proficient users. In this paper we propose a new type of general-purpose assistive agent called a Symbiont AI that is designed to support users with greater task flexibility and environmental resilience, and that can be trained on new tasks by non-technical users using a novel method we call Embodied Symbiotic Learning. Instead of programming an AI to perform tasks (either by explicit coding, demonstration, or machine learning) and then deploying the AI to assist a human, we form a Human-AI Symbiotic System in which an AI partners with a human and learns to assist the human in real-time, while the human learns to share the workload with the AI. Each partner develops a theory of mind of the other in real-time, so a partnership-specific set of expectations and communication norms emerges through the shared interactions. This allows the AI to be useful to the human even in open-ended or underspecified tasks. We also consider practical design considerations for such systems and present experimentally testable predictions that follow from this theory.",,第1页.xls
250,Cooperative Bayesian Optimization for Imperfect Agents,2023,"We introduce a cooperative Bayesian optimization problem for optimizing black-box functions of two variables where two agents choose together at which points to query the function but have only control over one variable each. This setting is inspired by human-AI teamwork, where an AI-assistant helps its human user solve a problem, in this simplest case, collaborative optimization. We formulate the solution as sequential decision-making, where the agent we control models the user as a computationally rational agent with prior knowledge about the function. We show that strategic planning of the queries enables better identification of the global maximum of the function as long as the user avoids excessive exploration. This planning is made possible by using Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo planning and by endowing the agent with a user model that accounts for conservative belief updates and exploratory sampling of the points to query.",,第1页.xls
251,"Should I Follow the Human, or Follow the Robot? - Robots in Power Can Have More Influence Than Humans on Decision-Making",2023,"Artificially intelligent (AI) agents such as robots are increasingly delegated power in work settings, yet it remains unclear how power functions in interactions with both humans and robots, especially when they directly compete for influence. Here we present an experiment where every participant was matched with one human and one robot to perform decision-making tasks. By manipulating who has power, we created three conditions: human as leader, robot as leader, and a no-power-difference control. The results showed that the participants were significantly more influenced by the leader, regardless of whether the leader was a human or a robot. However, they generally held a more positive attitude toward the human than the robot, although they considered whichever was in power as more competent. This study illustrates the importance of power for future Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human-AI Interaction (HAI) research, as it addresses pressing concerns of society about AI-powered intelligent agents.",,第1页.xls
252,Engineering Principles for Building Trusted Human-AI Systems,2024,"In the process engineering reliable and trustworthy AI systems there is significant wisdom to be gained from traditional engineering domains. Extending on earlier work our attention is on topics that stress the principles of building human-AI systems. We plea for a reinforced attention for engineering methods and processes in order to urge the essence for improved scientific progress and industrial AI applications where one can stand on the shoulders of giants. On the one hand, we see their complexity increase on an individual level, as well as on their connected dependency levels, whilst on the other hand, we see a growing lack of experience on the level of their design and engineering. The complexity of current AI models often limits our understanding. The methods and processes to ensure safety, reliability, and transparency are insufficient. This poses serious risks at the level of trustworthiness, particularly when it comes to critical applications with significant social, economic or even physical impact. Future AI systems must adhere to stringent requirements, as mandated, for instance, by the European AI Act, ensuring meticulous design, validation, and certification based on clearly defined criteria.",,第1页.xls
253,Outlining the Design Space of eXplainable Swarm (xSwarm): Experts' Perspective,2024,"In swarm robotics, agents interact through local roles to solve complex tasks beyond an individual's ability. Even though swarms are capable of carrying out some operations without the need for human intervention, many safety-critical applications still call for human operators to control and monitor the swarm. There are novel challenges to effective Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI) that are only beginning to be addressed. Explainability is one factor that can facilitate effective and trustworthy HSI and improves the overall performance of Human-Swarm team. Explainability was studied across various Human-AI domains, such as Human-Robot Interaction and Human-Centered ML. However, it is still ambiguous whether explanations studied in Human-AI literature would be beneficial in Human-Swarm research and development. Furthermore, the literature lacks foundational research on the prerequisites for explainability requirements in swarm robotics, i.e., what kind of questions an explainable swarm is expected to answer, and what types of explanations a swarm is expected to generate. By surveying 26 swarm experts, we seek to answer these questions and identify challenges experts faced to generate explanations in Human-Swarm environments. Our work contributes insights into defining a new area of research of eXplainable Swarm (xSwarm) which looks at how explainability can be implemented and developed in swarm systems. This paper opens discussion on xSwarm and paves the way for more research in the field.",,第1页.xls
254,"From speaking like a person to being personal: The effects of personalized, regular interactions with conversational agents",2024,"As human-AI interactions become more pervasive, conversational agents are increasingly relevant in our communication environment. While a rich body of research investigates the consequences of one-shot, single interactions with these agents, knowledge is still scarce on how these consequences evolve across regular, repeated interactions in which these agents make use of AI-enabled techniques to enable increasingly personalized conversations and recommendations. By means of a longitudinal experiment (N = 179) with an agent able to personalize a conversation, this study sheds light on how perceptions - about the agent (anthropomorphism and trust), the interaction (dialogue quality and privacy risks), and the information (relevance and credibility) - and behavior (self-disclosure and recommendation adherence) evolve across interactions. The findings highlight the role of interplay between system-initiated personalization and repeated exposure in this process, suggesting the importance of considering the role of AI in communication processes in a dynamic manner.

257,XFlag: Explainable Fake News Detection Model on Social Media,2022,"Social media allows any individual to disseminate information without third-party restrictions, making it difficult to verify the authenticity of a source. The proliferation of fake news has severely affected people's intentions and behaviors in trusting online sources. Applying AI approaches for fake news detection on social media is the focus of recent research, most of which, however, focuses on enhancing AI performance. This study proposes XFlag, an innovative explainable AI (XAI) framework which uses long short-term memory (LSTM) model to identify fake news articles, layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm to explain the fake news detection model based on LSTM, and situation awareness-based agent transparency (SAT) model to increase transparency in human-AI interaction. The developed XFlag framework has been empirically validated. The findings suggest the use of XFlag supports users in understanding system goals (perception), justifying system decisions (comprehension), and predicting system uncertainty (projection), with little cost of perceived cognitive workload.",,第1页.xls
258,ARL Battlespace: A Platform for Developing Novel AI for Complex Adversarial Reasoning in MDO,2022,"A barrier to developing novel AI for complex reasoning is the lack of appropriate wargaming platforms for training and evaluating AIs in a multiplayer setting combining collaborative and adversarial reasoning under uncertainty with game theory and deception. An appropriate platform has several key requirements including flexible scenario design and exploration, extensibility across all five elements of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), and capability for human-human and human-AI collaborative reasoning and data collection, to aid development of AI reasoning and the warrior-machine-like interface. Here, we describe the ARL Battlespace testbed which fulfills the above requirements for AI development, training and evaluation. ARL Battlespace is offered as an open source software platform (https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL_Battlespace). We present several example scenarios implemented in ARL Battlespace that illustrate different kinds of complex reasoning for AI development. We focus on 'gap' scenarios that simulate bridgehead and crossing tactics, and we highlight how they address key platform requirements including coordinated MDO actions, game theory and deception. We describe the process of reward shaping for these scenarios that will incentivize an agent to perform command and control (C2) tasks informed by human commanders' courses of action, as well as the key challenges that arise. The intuition presented will enable AI researchers to develop agents that will provide optimal policies for complex scenarios.",,第1页.xls
259,Examining the Effects of Race on Human-AI Cooperation,2021,"Recent literature has shown that racism and implicit racial biases can affect ones actions in major ways, from the time it takes police to decide whether they shoot an armed suspect, to a decision on whether to trust a stranger. Given that race is a social/power construct, artifacts can also be racialized, and these racialized agents have also been found to be treated differently based on their perceived race. We explored whether peoples decision to cooperate with an AI agent during a task (a modified version of the Stag hunt task) is affected by the knowledge that the AI agent was trained on a population of a particular race (Black, White, or a non-racialized control condition). These data show that White participants performed the best when the agent wasracializedas White and not racialized at all, while Black participants achieved the highest score when the agent was racialized as Black. Qualitative data indicated that White participants were less likely to report that they believed that the AI agent was attempting to cooperate during the task and were more likely to report that they doubted the intelligence of the AI agent. This work suggests that racialization of AI agents, even if superficial and not explicitly related to the behavior of that agent, may result in different cooperation behavior with that agent, showing potentially insidious and pervasive effects of racism on the way people interact with AI agents.",,第1页.xls
260,POSTER: A Teacher-Student with Human Feedback Model for Human-AI Collaboration in Cybersecurity,2023,"We have developed a novel 'Teacher-Student with human feedback' model for Human-Artificial Intelligence (AI) collaborations in cybersecurity tasks. In our model, AI furnishes sufficient information about its decision-making process to enable human agents to provide feedback to improve the model. Our key innovations include: enhancing the interpretability of AI models by analyzing falsely detected samples using LIME and SHAP values; developing a novel posthoc explanation-based dynamic teacher-student model to address concept drift or concept shift; integrating human experts' feedback on falsely detected samples to increase accuracy, precision, and recall values, without retraining the entire model; establishing a list of attack-based feature values for human experts to promote reproducibility. We show in experiments with real data and threat detection tasks that our model significantly improves the accuracy of existing AI algorithms for these tasks.",,第1页.xls
261,Explainability increases trust resilience in intelligent agents.,2024,"Even though artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems typically outperform human decision-makers, they are not immune to errors, leading users to lose trust in them and be less likely to use them again-a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. The purpose of the present research was to investigate whether explainable AI (XAI) could function as a viable strategy to counter algorithm aversion. We conducted two experiments to examine how XAI influences users' willingness to continue using AI-based systems when these systems exhibit errors. The results showed that, following the observation of algorithms erring, the inclination of users to delegate decisions to or follow advice from intelligent agents significantly decreased compared to the period before the errors were revealed. However, the explainability effectively mitigated this decline, with users in the XAI condition being more likely to continue utilizing intelligent agents for subsequent tasks after seeing algorithms erring than those in the non-XAI condition. We further found that the explainability could reduce users' decision regret, and the decrease in decision regret mediated the relationship between the explainability and re-use behaviour. These findings underscore the adaptive function of XAI in alleviating negative user experiences and maintaining user trust in the context of imperfect AI.",,第1页.xls
262,Tackling Cooperative Incompatibility for Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination [arXiv],2023,"Achieving coordination between humans and artificial intelligence in scenarios involving previously unencountered humans remains a substantial obstacle within Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination, which aims to develop AI agents capable of efficiently working alongside previously unknown human teammates. Traditional algorithms have aimed to collaborate with humans by optimizing fixed objectives within a population, fostering diversity in strategies and behaviors. However, these techniques may lead to learning loss and an inability to cooperate with specific strategies within the population, a phenomenon named cooperative incompatibility. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Cooperative Open-ended LEarning (COLE) framework, which formulates open-ended objectives in cooperative games with two players using perspectives of graph theory to evaluate and pinpoint the cooperative capacity of each strategy. We put forth a practical algorithm incorporating insights from game theory and graph theory, e.g., Shapley Value and Centrality. We also show that COLE could effectively overcome the cooperative incompatibility from theoretical and empirical analysis. Subsequently, we created an online Overcooked human-AI experiment platform, the COLE platform, which enables easy customization of questionnaires, model weights, and other aspects. Utilizing the COLE platform, we enlist 130 participants for human experiments. Our findings reveal a preference for our approach over state-of-the-art methods using a variety of subjective metrics. Moreover, objective experimental outcomes in the Overcooked game environment indicate that our method surpasses existing ones when coordinating with previously unencountered AI agents and the human proxy model.

263,A Quantum Model of Trust Calibration in Human-AI Interactions,2023,"This exploratory study investigates a human agent's evolving judgements of reliability when interacting with an AI system. Two aims drove this investigation: (1) compare the predictive performance of quantum vs. Markov random walk models regarding human reliability judgements of an AI system and (2) identify a neural correlate of the perturbation of a human agent's judgement of the AI's reliability. As AI becomes more prevalent, it is important to understand how humans trust these technologies and how trust evolves when interacting with them. A mixed-methods experiment was developed for exploring reliability calibration in human-AI interactions. The behavioural data collected were used as a baseline to assess the predictive performance of the quantum and Markov models. We found the quantum model to better predict the evolving reliability ratings than the Markov model. This may be due to the quantum model being more amenable to represent the sometimes pronounced within-subject variability of reliability ratings. Additionally, a clear event-related potential response was found in the electroencephalographic (EEG) data, which is attributed to the expectations of reliability being perturbed. The identification of a trust-related EEG-based measure opens the door to explore how it could be used to adapt the parameters of the quantum model in real time.",,第1页.xls
264,Artificial Agents Inspired by Human Motivation Psychology for Teamwork in Hazardous Environments,2023,"Multi-agent literature explores personifying artificial agents with personality, emotions or cognitive biases to produce typical, believable agents. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of endowing artificial agents with a motivation, using human implicit motivation psychology theory that introduces 3 motive profiles - power, achievement and affiliation, to create diverse, risk-aware agents. We first devise a framework to model these motivated agents (or agents with any inherent behavior), that can activate different strategies depending on the circumstances. We conduct experiments on a fire-fighting task domain, evaluate how motivated teams perform, and draw conclusions on appropriate team compositions to be deployed in environments with different risk levels. We find that motivational diversity within teams is beneficial in dynamic collaborative environments, especially as the task risk level increases. Furthermore, we observed that the best team composition in terms of the performance metrics used to evaluate teams, does not remain the same as the collaboration level required to achieve goals changes. These results have implications for future designs of risk-aware autonomous teams and Human-AI teams, as they highlight the prospects of creating better artificial teammates and performance gains that could be achieved through anthro-pomorphized motivated agents.",,第1页.xls
265,Toward Co-creative Dungeon Generation via Transfer Learning,2021,"Co-creative Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) refers to systems where a PCGML agent and a human work together to produce output content. One of the limitations of co-creative PCGML is that it requires co-creative training data for a PCGML agent to learn to interact with humans. However, acquiring this data is a difficult and time-consuming process. In this work, we propose approximating human-AI interaction data and employing transfer learning to adapt learned co-creative knowledge from one game to a different game. We explore this approach for co-creative Zelda dungeon room generation.",,第1页.xls
266,Toward XAI & Human Synergies to Explain the History of Art: The Smart Photobooth Project,2021,"The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought about significant changes in our daily lives with applications including industry, smart cities, agriculture, and telemedicine. Despite the successes of AI in other less-technical domains, human-AI synergies are required to ensure user engagement and provide interactive expert knowledge. This is notably the case of applications related to art since the appreciation and the comprehension of art is considered to be an exclusively human capacity. This paper discusses the potential human-AI synergies aiming at explaining the history of art and artistic style transfer. This work is done in the context of the Smart Photobooth a project which runs within the AI & Art pavilion. The latter is a satellite event of Esch2022 European Capital of Culture whose main aim is to reflect on AI and the future of art. The project is mainly an outreach and knowledge dissemination project, it uses a smart photo-booth, capable of automatically transforming the user's picture into a well-known artistic style (e.g., impressionism), as an interactive approach to introduce the principles of the history of art to the open public and provide them with a simple explanation of different art painting styles. Whereas some of the cutting-edge AI algorithms can provide insights on what constitutes an artistic style on the visual level, the information provided by human experts is essential to explain the historical and political context in which the style emerged. To bridge this gap, this paper explores Human-AI synergies in which the explanation generated by the eXplainable AI (XAI) mechanism is coupled with insights from the human expert to provide explanations for school students as well as a wider audience. Open issues and challenges are also identified and discussed.",,第1页.xls
267,A Critical Analysis of the Trust Human Agents Have in Computational and Embodied AI,2020,"The notion of trust has evolved to become one of the many nebulous buzzwords centering around AI. This paper aims at showing that, with regards to human influenceability through AI, trust in AI is to be seen as problematic. Based on the notion of socio-technical epistemic systems, I will argue that the trust human agents have in AI is strongly related to what could be understood as algorithmic authority. The second part of this paper will then translate the elaborated line of argument to the field of social robotics.",,第1页.xls
268,AI as a Citizen: Eliciting Smart City Future Stories through Human-AI Collaborative Fiction Writing,2024,"Smart cities are becoming an inevitable trend in the design of urban futures. With the speed of technological advancement, by the time that smart city visions come to life, the urban environment could already be seen as a co-living space of humans and technological entities, such as Artificial Intelligence. This raises the question of whether these future visions should get already co-created by both people and technology, especially given AI's potential role as a decision-making agent in data-driven smart city visions (e.g. urban planning). In this workshop, we aim to explore how visions of smart city futures can be co-speculated by people and AI through the collaborative process of writing fiction. Through writing short speculative stories, we want to encourage participants to critically reflect on their own expectations about smart city futures, as well as on what values these should preferably be based on. Moreover, we will analyze and discuss the future narratives and potential biases that AI might bring into the process of futuring.",,第1页.xls
269,ConvXAI : Delivering Heterogeneous AI Explanations via Conversations to Support Human-AI Scientific Writing,2023,"Despite a surge collection of XAI methods, users still struggle to obtain required AI explanations. Previous research suggests chatbots as dynamic solutions, but the effective design of conversational XAI agents for practical human needs remains under-explored. This paper focuses on Conversational XAI for AI-assisted scientific writing tasks. Drawing from human linguistic theories and formative studies, we identify four design rationales: multifaceted, controllability, mix-initiative, context-aware drill-down. We incorporate them into an interactive prototype, ConvXAI 1, which facilitates heterogeneous AI explanations for scientific writing through dialogue. In two studies with 21 users, ConvXAI outperforms a GUI-based baseline on improving human-perceived understanding and writing improvement. The paper further discusses the practical human usage patterns in interacting with ConvXAI for scientific co-writing2.",,第1页.xls

271,"In human-machine trust, humans rely on a simple averaging strategy.",2024,"With the growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in our lives, attention is increasingly turning to the way that humans and AI work together. A key aspect of human-AI collaboration is how people integrate judgements or recommendations from machine agents, when they differ from their own judgements. We investigated trust in human-machine teaming using a perceptual judgement task based on the judge-advisor system. Participants ( n = 89 ) estimated a perceptual quantity, then received a recommendation from a machine agent. The participants then made a second response which combined their first estimate and the machine's recommendation. The degree to which participants shifted their second response in the direction of the recommendations provided a measure of their trust in the machine agent. We analysed the role of advice distance in people's willingness to change their judgements. When a recommendation falls a long way from their initial judgement, do people come to doubt their own judgement, trusting the recommendation more, or do they doubt the machine agent, trusting the recommendation less? We found that although some participants exhibited these behaviours, the most common response was neither of these tendencies, and a simple model based on averaging accounted best for participants' trust behaviour. We discuss implications for theories of trust, and human-machine teaming.",,第1页.xls

274,The Impact of Explanations on AI Competency Prediction in VQA [arXiv],2020,"Explainability is one of the key elements for building trust in AI systems. Among numerous attempts to make AI explainable, quantifying the effect of explanations remains a challenge in conducting human-AI collaborative tasks. Aside from the ability to predict the overall behavior of AI, in many applications, users need to understand an AI agent's competency in different aspects of the task domain. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of explanations on the user's mental model of AI agent competency within the task of visual question answering (VQA). We quantify users' understanding of competency, based on the correlation between the actual system performance and user rankings. We introduce an explainable VQA system that uses spatial and object features and is powered by the BERT language model. Each group of users sees only one kind of explanation to rank the competencies of the VQA model. The proposed model is evaluated through between-subject experiments to probe explanations' impact on the user's perception of competency. The comparison between two VQA models shows BERT based explanations and the use of object features improve the user's prediction of the model's competencies.",,第1页.xls
275,Understanding the Dynamics in Creating Domain-Specific AI Design Guidelines: A Case Study of a Leading Digital Finance Company in South Korea,2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) significantly impacts the user experience (UX) across a wide range of products and services. However, many practitioners find it challenging to design the UX for AI-enhanced products. Although there are human-AI interaction design guidelines available, they are often too generic to fully address domain-specific challenges in fields such as finance and healthcare. Additionally, they sometimes overlook the constraints imposed by different working environments. In this research, we conducted a case study at one of the leading financial corporations in South Korea to develop their own AI product interaction guidelines. We interviewed 13 practitioners including bank UX practitioners, design agency UX designers, and academic UX researchers who were involved in this initiative, to gather insights into their experiences with crafting these guidelines. Our findings revealed a mixed reception towards existing AI design resources among practitioners, underscoring the necessity to incorporate elements specific to banking services, such as the company's customer experience (CX) principles, overarching agent personas, multifaceted channels, and diverse interaction modalities. We also observed the importance of understanding the dynamics among various stakeholders within a company. We discuss the implications and design considerations for creating domain-specific resources specialized in AI interactions.",,第1页.xls

277,How AI's Self-Prolongation Influences People's Perceptions of Its Autonomous Mind: The Case of U.S. Residents.,2023,"The expanding integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in various aspects of society makes the infosphere around us increasingly complex. Humanity already faces many obstacles trying to have a better understanding of our own minds, but now we have to continue finding ways to make sense of the minds of AI. The issue of AI's capability to have independent thinking is of special attention. When dealing with such an unfamiliar concept, people may rely on existing human properties, such as survival desire, to make assessments. Employing information-processing-based Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics on a dataset of 266 residents in the United States, we found that the more people believe that an AI agent seeks continued functioning, the more they believe in that AI agent's capability of having a mind of its own. Moreover, we also found that the above association becomes stronger if a person is more familiar with personally interacting with AI. This suggests a directional pattern of value reinforcement in perceptions of AI. As the information processing of AI becomes even more sophisticated in the future, it will be much harder to set clear boundaries about what it means to have an autonomous mind.",,第1页.xls

Our agent utilizes planning to determine which actions to perform, and plan recognition to determine the current goal of its cooperator in order to assist them. We also present an experiment we performed with human participants, and how our agent performs at a level that is comparable to other AI agents playing with themselves, when playing with a human player, as well as the impact of plan recognition on how the participants perceive the AI agent.",,第1页.xls
279,(Over)Trusting AI Recommendations: How System and Person Variables Affect Dimensions of Complacency,2024,"Over-trusting AI systems can lead to complacency and decision errors. However, human and system variables may affect complacency and it is important to understand their interplay for HCI. In our experiment, 90 participants were confronted with traffic route problems guided by AI recommendations and thereby assigned to either a transparent system providing reasons for recommendations or a non-transparent system. We found transparent systems to lower the potential to alleviate workload (albeit not to neglect monitoring), but to simultaneously foster actual complacent behavior. On the contrary, we found performance expectancy to foster the potential to alleviate workload, but not complacent behavior. Interaction analyses showed that effects of performance expectancy depend on system transparency. This contributes to our understanding how system- and person-related variables interact in affecting complacency and stresses the differences between dimensions of complacency and the need for carefully considering transparency and performance expectancy in AI research and design.",,第1页.xls
280,It is your turn: collaborative ideation with a co-creative robot through sketch,2020,"Co-creative systems have been widely explored in the field of computational creativity. However, existing AI partners of these systems are mostly virtual agents. As sketching on paper with embodied robots could be more engaging for designers' early-stage ideation and collaborative practices, we envision the possibility of Cobbie, a mobile robot that ideates iteratively with designers by generating creative and diverse sketches. To evaluate the differences in co-creativity and user experience between the co-creative robots and virtual agents, we conducted a comparative experiment and analyzed the data collected from quantitative scales, observation, and semi-structured interview. The results reveal that Cobbie is more satisfying in motivating exploration, provoking unexpected ideas and engaging designers in the collaborative ideation process. Based on these findings, we discussed the prospects of co-creative robots for future developments of human-AI collaborative systems.",,第1页.xls
281,Forecasting Future Behavior: Agents in Board Game Strategy,2024,"This paper presents findings on machine learning agent behavior prediction in a board game application developed by a group of students. The goal of this research is to create a model facilitating collaboration between a user and an AI to play together in the board game using a Human-in-the-Loop architecture. By injecting explainability, the aim is to enhance communication and understanding between the user and the AI agent. Featuring a competitive Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on the Proximal Policy Optimization model, this research explores methods to make AI decisions transparent for enhanced player understanding. Two predictive models, a Decision Tree (DT) and a Deep Learning (DL) classifier, were developed and compared. The results show that the DT model is effective for short-term predictions but limited in broader applications, while the DL classifier shows potential for long-term prediction without requiring direct access to the game's AI.

For practice and experimentation, we provide links to current non-human agents. We then distinguish automation and autonomy, and discuss humanness design, teaming. A deeper understanding of usability and ethical considerations for working alongside these systems, deploying robots and building bonds and trust with nonhuman agents, begins with differentiation of automation and autonomy, human-autonomy teaming, and a humanness design approach as a means to prevent undesirable autonomy. While TPC scholarship attends to privacy, accountability, safety and security, and transparency and explainability, we need additional vigilance regarding fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, TPC professional responsibility, and continued promotion of human values as we work alongside non-human agents.",,第1页.xls

The UIST community has a unique vantage point that can lead to critical contributions in envisioning a future of interactive computing that appropriately leverages the power of these new generative AI models. However, we are only just beginning to understand the research area that exists at the intersection of interaction and generative AI. By bringing together members of the UIST community interested in this intersection, we seek to initiate discussions on the potential of generative AI in architecting new forms of interactions. Key topics of interest include the exploration of novel categories of interactions made possible by generative AI, the development of methods for enabling more powerful and direct user control of generative AI, and the identification of model and architecture requirements for generative AI in interaction literature.

286,How is the AI Perceived When It Behaves (Un)Fairly?,2023,"Fairness plays a crucial role in human-human interaction, so it is expected to play a significant role in human-AI interaction as well. Integrating the principles of fairness into AI design and investigating people's perceptions of it can help improve user experience and ensure AI systems are responsible, trustworthy, ethical, and human-centered. In the current study, we simulated different human behaviors in economic games through a human fairness model and reinforcement learning approach and then conducted an experiment to investigate how people perceive AI agents with varying levels of fairness. The study was a within-subject experiment with 2 treatments (fair vs. unfair AI), in which the participants play the Alternated Repeated Ultimatum Game (ARUG) for 12 rounds with each AI agent. The results suggest that the participants evaluated fair AI as having higher levels of warmth, intelligence, animacy, likability, and safety compared to unfair AI. These findings indicate that AI that aligns with social norms is more favored by people. We discuss the theoretical implications for comprehending people's behavior and attitude towards AI fairness and the practical implications for designing AI that has the potential to increase fairness in society.",,第1页.xls

Considered as a sequence of poses of a humanoid, the task can be considered as a sequence generation problem with spatiotemporal smoothness and realism constraints. Additionally, we wish to control the behavior of AI agents by giving them what to do and, more specifically, how to do it. We proposed a spatiotemporally-conditioned GAN that generates a sequence that is similar to a given sequence in terms of semantics and spatiotemporal dynamics. Using LSTM-based generator and graph ConvNet discriminator, this system is trained end-to-end on a large gathered dataset of gestures, expressions, and actions. Experiments showed that compared to traditional conditional GAN, our method creates plausible, realistic, and semantically relevant humanoid animation sequences that match user expectations.",,第1页.xls
288,Towards a systematic educational framework for human-machine teaming,2021,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are having a great impact on all aspects of society. However, due to the technical competencies and mathematical understanding required for implementing solutions leveraging these technologies, access to the communities working on these technologies is limited to those having these skills. This limits the ability of domain experts to directly transfer their knowledge and contribute to the development of AI and ML systems. To address this problem, we propose the Human Education AI Teaming (HEAT) framework, in which we draw on human education to design an innovative education system to enable collaboration between humans and AI cognitive agents. The main aim of HEAT is to promote the social integration of AI by allowing domain experts to focus more on communicating a body of knowledge to the machine, and less on the computational, data, and engineering concepts associated with how the machine learns. We follow an educational theory-driven approach to derive the content knowledge and competencies required by each agent. We conclude the paper with a demonstration case study explaining how the complex autonomous guidance of a flock of sheep could leverage HEAT to make the technology accessible by empowering non-AI specialists, livestock farmers in our example.",,第1页.xls

290,Toward human-centered shared autonomy AI paradigms for human-robot teaming in healthcare,2024,"With recent advancements in AI and computation tools, intelligent paradigms emerged to empower different fields such as healthcare robots with new capabilities. Advanced AI robotic algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can be trained and developed to autonomously make individual decisions to achieve a desired and usually fixed goal. However, such independent decisions and goal achievements might not be ideal for a healthcare robot that usually interacts with a dynamic end-user or a patient. In such a complex human-robot interaction (teaming) framework, the dynamic user continuously wants to be involved in decision-making as well as introducing new goals while interacting with their present environment in real-time. To address this challenge, an adaptive shared autonomy AI paradigm is required to be developed for the two interactive agents (Human & AI agents) with a foundation based on human-centered factors to avoid any possible ethical issues and guarantee no harm to humanity.",,第1页.xls

Advances in AI agents are transferring communication, particularly in mental health, where AI chatbots provide accessible, non-judgmental support. However, a key challenge is how effectively these systems can express empathy, which is crucial in human-centered design. Current research highlights a gap in understanding how AI can authentically convey empathy, particularly as issues like anxiety, depression, and loneliness increase. Our research focuses on this gap by comparing empathy expression in human-human versus human-AI interactions. Using personal narratives and statistical analysis, we examine empathy levels elicited by humans and AI, including GPT-4o and fine-tuned versions of the model. This work aims to enhance the authenticity of AI-driven empathy, contributing to the future design of more reliable and effective mental health support systems that foster meaningful social interactions.",,第1页.xls
292,A Hierarchical Approach to Population Training for Human-AI Collaboration,2023,"A major challenge for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents is to collaborate with novel partners that were not encountered by them during the training phase. This is specifically worsened by an increased variance in action responses when the DRL agents collaborate with human partners due to the lack of consistency in human behaviors. Recent work have shown that training a single agent as the best response to a diverse population of training partners significantly increases an agent's robustness to novel partners. We further enhance the population-based training approach by introducing a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) based method for Human-AI Collaboration. Our agent is able to learn multiple best-response policies as its low-level policy while at the same time, it learns a high-level policy that acts as a manager which allows the agent to dynamically switch between the low-level best-response policies based on its current partner. We demonstrate that our method is able to dynamically adapt to novel partners of different play styles and skill levels in the 2-player collaborative Overcooked game environment. We also conducted a human study in the same environment to test the effectiveness of our method when partnering with real human subjects.

293,Experts or Authorities? The Strange Case of the Presumed Epistemic Superiority of Artificial Intelligence Systems,2024,"The high predictive accuracy of contemporary machine learning-based AI systems has led some scholars to argue that, in certain cases, we should grant them epistemic expertise and authority over humans. This approach suggests that humans would have the epistemic obligation of relying on the predictions of a highly accurate AI system. Contrary to this view, in this work we claim that it is not possible to endow AI systems with a genuine account of epistemic expertise. In fact, relying on accounts of expertise and authority from virtue epistemology, we show that epistemic expertise requires a relation with understanding that AI systems do not satisfy and intellectual abilities that these systems do not manifest. Further, following the Distribution Cognition theory and adapting an account by Croce on the virtues of collective epistemic agents to the case of human-AI interactions we show that, if an AI system is successfully appropriated by a human agent, a hybrid epistemic agent emerges, which can become both an epistemic expert and an authority. Consequently, we claim that the aforementioned hybrid agent is the appropriate object of a discourse around trust in AI and the epistemic obligations that stem from its epistemic superiority.",,第1页.xls
294,Empirical Evaluations of Framework for Adaptive Trust Calibration in Human-AI Cooperation,2020,"Recent advances in AI technologies are dramatically changing the world and impacting our daily life. However, human users still essentially need to cooperate with AI systems to complete tasks as such technologies are never perfect. For optimal performance and safety in human-AI cooperation, human users must appropriately adjust their level of trust to the actual reliability of AI systems. Poorly calibrated trust can be a major cause of serious issues with safety and efficiency. Previous works on trust calibration have emphasized the importance of system transparency for avoiding trust miscalibration. Measuring and influencing trust are still challenging issues; consequently, not many studies have focused on how to detect improper trust calibration nor how to mitigate it. We approach these research challenges with a behavior-based approach to capture the status of calibration. A framework of adaptive trust calibration is proposed, including a formal definition of improper trust calibration called a trust equation. It involves cognitive cues called trust calibration cues (TCCs) and a conceptual entity called trust calibration AI (TCAI), which supervises the status of trust calibration. We conducted empirical evaluations using a simulated drone environment with two types of cooperative tasks: a visual search task and a real-time navigation task. We designed trust changing scenarios and evaluated our framework. The results demonstrated that adaptively presenting a TCC could promote trust calibration more effectively than a traditional system transparency approach.",,第1页.xls

296,The Overcooked Generalisation Challenge,2024,"We introduce the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge (OGC) - the first benchmark to study agents' zero-shot cooperation abilities when faced with novel partners and levels in the Overcooked-AI environment. This perspective starkly contrasts a large body of previous work that has trained and evaluated cooperating agents only on the same level, failing to capture generalisation abilities required for real-world human-AI cooperation. Our challenge interfaces with state-of-the-art dual curriculum design (DCD) methods to generate auto-curricula for training general agents in Overcooked. It is the first cooperative multi-agent environment specially designed for DCD methods and, consequently, the first benchmarked with state-of-the-art methods. It is fully GPU-accelerated, built on the DCD benchmark suite minimax, and freely available under an open-source license: https://git.hcics.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/public-projects/OGC. We show that current DCD algorithms struggle to produce useful policies in this novel challenge, even if combined with recent network architectures that were designed for scalability and generalisability. The OGC pushes the boundaries of real-world human-AI cooperation by enabling the research community to study the impact of generalisation on cooperating agents.",,第1页.xls
297,Learning Adaptation and Generalization from Human-Inspired Meta-Reinforcement Learning Using Bayesian Knowledge and Analysis,2023,"Over the last decades, there has been growing interest in research in multiple and interdisciplinary fields of human-AI computing. In particular, approaches integrating the intersecting design with reinforcement learning (RL) have received more attention. However, the current research on RL may need to consider its enhancement from a human-inspired approach further. In the present work, we focus on enabling a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agent to achieve adaptation and generalization according to modeling Markov decision processes using Bayesian knowledge and analysis. By introducing a novel framework called human-inspired meta-RL (HMRL), we incorporate the agent performing resilient actions to leverage the dynamic dense reward based on the knowledge and prediction of a Bayesian analysis. The proposed framework can make the agent learn generalization and prevent the agent from failing catastrophically. The experimental results show that our approach helps the agent reduce computational costs with learning adaptation. Finally, we conclude and anticipate that integrating human-inspired meta-RL can enable learning more formulations relating to robustness and scalability, leading to promising directions and more complex AI goals in the future.",,第1页.xls

While generative AI enables interactive and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-cognitive skills learning. To this end, we introduced SimuLife++, an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows users to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-based characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular, we expanded the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including a sage agent, who acts as a bystander to provide users with more insightful perspectives on their choices and conversations. Through a within-subject user study, we found that the inclusion of the sage agent significantly enhanced narrative immersion, according to the narrative transportation scale, leading to more messages, particularly in group chats. Participants' interactions with the sage agent were also associated with significantly higher scores in their perceived motivation, self-perceptions, and resilience and coping, indicating positive impacts on non-cognitive skills reflection. Participants' interview results further explained the sage agent's aid in decision-making, solving ethical dilemmas, and problem-solving; on the other hand, they suggested improvements in user control and balanced responses from multiple characters. We provide design implications on the application of generative AI in narrative solutions for non-cognitive skill development in broader social contexts.",,第1页.xls
299,How Humans Perceive Human-like Behavior in Video Game Navigation,2022,"The goal of this paper is to understand how people assess human-likeness in human- and AI-generated behavior. To this end, we present a qualitative study of hundreds of crowd-sourced assessments of human-likeness of behavior in a 3D video game navigation task. In particular, we focus on an AI agent that has passed a Turing Test, in the sense that human judges were not able to reliably distinguish between videos of a human and AI agent navigating on a quantitative level. Our insights shine a light on the characteristics that people consider as human-like. Understanding these characteristics is a key first step for improving AI agents in the future.",,第1页.xls
300,"Robot-Robot Interaction, Toward New Conversational Artificial Intelligence Aesthetic",2021,"Artificial Intelligence nowadays is an intriguing medium for the new generation of contemporary artists. They are many approaches to the utilization of AI as creative media. Our creative practice and art-based research approach challenge artificial intelligence abstraction and automated content creation with notable philosophical publications. We move the medium beyond traditional usage and interpretations by designing AI agents more independent and engaged in creation through new types of robot-robot interactions. The medium as such is not any more in complete control of an artist and known artistic practices. Hence, we need to extend our aesthetical and conceptual judgments from solely human to human and robot creativity analysis. Consequently, we aim to raise some of the fundamental questions about artificial intelligence's impact on future human-AI society. This paper will present the two artworks, Robosophy Philosophy and Botorikko, Machine Created State, which are part of the Syntropic Counterpoints ongoing art-based research project. The key novelty in these installations is the use of artificial intelligence - artificial intelligence interaction and universal but abstract human knowledge to investigate AI creative and mindful potentials.",,第1页.xls
301,AI's Humanoid Appearance Can Affect Human Perceptions of Its Emotional Capability: Evidence from Self-Reported Data in the U.S,2024,"As artificial intelligence (AI) integration becomes more prominent in society, the infosphere becomes increasingly complex. A better understanding of the human-AI relationship is crucial during these rapid technological and social changes. Emotions are complex responses of the human mind - a highly advanced information processing system. Thus, examining how humans perceive AI's emotional capability may provide helpful insights. Human physiological properties such as humanoid appearance and gender are suggested to be potential influencing factors. Following the information processing approach, we employed Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics on a dataset of 266 residents of the United States. Results show that interacting with an AI agent with human-like physical features is positively associated with the belief in that AI agent's capability of experiencing emotional pain and pleasure. This effect is stronger in males than females. A possible explanation for these patterns is reliance on cognitive strategies used in interpersonal interactions, including gender-specific physiological properties. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of using a compatible information processing analytical method such as BMF for studying humans' perceptions of AI.",,第1页.xls
302,Why Do You Trust Siri?: The Factors Affecting Trustworthiness of Intelligent Personal Assistant,2021,"Trust greatly contributes to human-AI collaboration, however, human's trust to IPA is hard to establish and lacks exploration. The purpose of this paper is to recognize the factors that affect the trustworthiness of IPA. 358 questionnaires were analyzed by PLS-SEM to construct the model, while thematic analysis was used to discover expectance of IPA. Chi-square tests and T-test were used to distinguish the difference between two user groups. Three factors that capability of system, personality of agent, and availability of interface have a significant impact on the trustworthiness of IPA. The capability of system is the most essential as the threshold with users' plenty of expectations. Most users pay less attention to the availability of interface and the personality of agent has a great impact on the trustworthiness of IPA. The factors found enrich the trusted AI research and inspire insights of design of IPA. © 2021 ASIS&T.",,第1页.xls
303,DECI: The 2nd Tutorial on Designing Effective Conversational Interfaces,2024,"Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) have been argued to have advantages over traditional GUIs due to having a more human-like interaction. The growing popularity of conversational agents has enabled humans to interact with machines more naturally. People are increasingly familiar with conversational interactions mediated by technology due to the widespread use of mobile devices and messaging services and a hungry market for conversational agents. Based on the recent advances in conversational AI, due to the proliferation of large language models, there are clear signs that the future of human-computer interaction will have a significant conversational component. Today, over two-thirds of the population on our planet has access to the Internet, with ever-lowering barriers to accessibility. This tutorial will showcase the benefits of employing novel conversational interfaces for crowd computing, human-AI decision making, health and well-being, and information retrieval. Given the widespread adoption of AI systems across several domains, we will discuss the potential of conversational interfaces in facilitating and mediating people's interactions with AI systems and the opportunities and challenges that lie at this intersection from the user modeling and personalization standpoint. The tutorial will include interactive elements and discussions and provide participants with practical insights to inform the design of effective conversational interfaces.",,第1页.xls

305,Linguistic analysis of human-computer interaction,2024,"This article reviews recent literature investigating speech variation in production and comprehension during spoken language communication between humans and devices. Human speech patterns toward voice-AI presents a test to our scientific understanding about speech communication and language use. First, work exploring how human-AI interactions are similar to, or different from, human-human interactions in the realm of speech variation is reviewed. In particular, we focus on studies examining how users adapt their speech when resolving linguistic misunderstandings by computers and when accommodating their speech toward devices. Next, we consider work that investigates how top-down factors in the interaction can influence users' linguistic interpretations of speech produced by technological agents and how the ways in which speech is generated (via text-to-speech synthesis, TTS) and recognized (using automatic speech recognition technology, ASR) has an effect on communication. Throughout this review, we aim to bridge both HCI frameworks and theoretical linguistic models accounting for variation in human speech. We also highlight findings in this growing area that can provide insight to the cognitive and social representations underlying linguistic communication more broadly. Additionally, we touch on the implications of this line of work for addressing major societal issues in speech technology. Copyright © 2024 Zellou and Holliday.",,第1页.xls
306,"Human-AI Collaboration to Promote Trust, Engagement and Adaptation in the Process of Pro-environmental and Health Behaviour Change",2023,"A necessary step in the digitalization of our environments is to include the users in the decision loop, following a more human-centric paradigm. Such an aproach will make their interactions with surrounding technology closer to them. Therefore, there is a recurrent need in contemporary technological solutions to create proposals to assist users in a way that is not exclusive to them and makes them feel integrated into the intelligent system. In fact, this is particularly relevant when the proposed technology or system aims to nudge users to form, shape, or change their daily behaviours. In essence, solutions designed for assisting users in that matter need to consider the inclusion of humans in the learning/decision loop and still the literature in the field is scarce. In this work, we identify and address three crucial human requirements that this technology has to integrate to promote a comfortable and long-term use of technology for the effective assistance of behaviour change: trust, engagement, and adaptation. Besides, we propose a collaborative workflow based on hybrid intelligent systems to cover the lack of human requirements and needs of traditional approaches. In essence, this work aims to shed light on how to promote closer collaboration between humans and intelligent agents for behaviour change under the principle that people should not be treated as mere users of technologies and services, but their behaviour should become one of the critical levers for designing and using technologies. That is, creating a closer interaction between these technologies and people.",,第1页.xls

With a growing demand for real-world evaluations, our study presents Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in a month-long live show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. This case study investigates human improvisers co-creating with conversational agents in a professional theatre setting. We explore the technical capabilities and constraints of on-the-spot multi-party dialogue, providing comprehensive insights from both audience and performer experiences with AI on stage. Our human-in-the-loop methodology underlines the challenges of these LLMs in generating context-relevant responses, stressing the user interface's crucial role. Audience feedback indicates an evolving interest for AI-driven live entertainment, direct human-AI interaction, and a diverse range of expectations about AI's conversational competence and utility as a creativity support tool.

309,Enhancing Tactical Military Mission Execution through Human-AI Collaboration: A View on Air Battle Management Systems,2024,"Military mission planning spans a broad spectrum, encompassing strategic, operational, and tactical dimensions, with timeframes ranging from months to seconds. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers great promise to enhance operational speed and effectiveness. This paper explores the intricacies of improving tactical military mission execution through the collaboration of human and AI systems. For this, we derive three distinct categories of human decision-making within mission execution: Level 1 - course of action refinement, Level 2 - task planning and scheduling, and Level 3 - tactical behavior generation. We analyze two AI-enhanced architectural approaches: A centralized Air Battle Management System (ABMS), which optimizes mission execution by providing a holistic operational view, and a decentralized, user-centric ABMS, which augments human operators with intelligent agents to improve the speed and quality of decision-making. While empirical implementation and quantitative analysis are beyond our scope, we provide a theoretical framework and rationale for these AI-enhanced architectural approaches. We advocate for the user-centric system and present our work on the software agents. Furthermore, we conceptualize a hybrid planning system for Level 2 decisions, designed to address the scalability challenges.",,第1页.xls
310,Cyborg as the Only Possible Moral Agent in Digital Age,2021,"This paper is devoted to the analysis of the concepts of moral responsibility and moral agency in the context of relationships between human and artificial intelligence. An active application of artificial intelligence in contemporary world questions accepted assumptions of moral responsibility for actions. If an autopilot driven car crashes due to a drivers fault, can an autopilot be considered morally responsible? If the autopilot is not considered to be responsible, then who does: the passenger who was supposed to take control, or the developer who set the algorithm for the autopilot. In other words, who is considered to be a moral agent in such situations? Both options seem problematic therefore the notion of moral responsibility should be reconsidered. Technological progress leads to the situation where only the integrational system which includes both human and artificial intelligence could be morally responsible. The paper contains an analysis of some arguments against such kind of moral agency. As a conclusion paper says that only cyborg-like joint human-AI system could be recognized as moral agent.",,第1页.xls
311,MindSpeech: Continuous Imagined Speech Decoding using High-Density fNIRS and Prompt Tuning for Advanced Human-AI Interaction,2024,"In the coming decade, artificial intelligence systems will continue to improve and revolutionise every industry and facet of human life. Designing effective, seamless and symbiotic communication paradigms between humans and AI agents is increasingly important. This paper reports a novel method for human-AI interaction by developing a direct brain-AI interface. We discuss a novel AI model, called MindSpeech, which enables open-vocabulary, continuous decoding for imagined speech. This study focuses on enhancing human-AI communication by utilising high-density functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data to develop an AI model capable of decoding imagined speech non-invasively. We discuss a new word cloud paradigm for data collection, improving the quality and variety of imagined sentences generated by participants and covering a broad semantic space. Utilising a prompt tuning-based approach, we employed the Llama2 large language model (LLM) for text generation guided by brain signals. Our results show significant improvements in key metrics, such as BLEU-1 and BERT P scores, for three out of four participants, demonstrating the method's effectiveness. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining data from multiple participants enhances the decoder performance, with statistically significant improvements in BERT scores for two participants. Furthermore, we demonstrated significantly above-chance decoding accuracy for imagined speech versus resting conditions and the identified activated brain regions during imagined speech tasks in our study are consistent with the previous studies on brain regions involved in speech encoding. This study underscores the feasibility of continuous imagined speech decoding. By integrating high-density fNIRS with advanced AI techniques, we highlight the potential for non-invasive, accurate communication systems with AI in the near future.",,第1页.xls
312,Artificial Intelligence and Ethical Issues,2020,"This study examined ethical issues related to the development and usage of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years. First, the study explored the research and discussions from the disciplines of philosophy and ethics. It found that ontological perception toward AI and robots could be the most important framework and standard for the understanding of, and the solution for ethical issues and problems associated with AI. Second, the study investigated the sub-areas and their ethical issues in the study of communication, including robot journalism and human-AI interaction. Finally, the study introduced an exploratory study that examined users' attitude toward the responses and role of AI robot when the users committed unethical behaviors or unethical language use. The exploratory study uncovered that the users expected socially desirable responses and ethical guideline from AI robot even when they were involved in unethical behaviors or unethical language use. Moreover, the users expected a higher moral standard when unethical behaviors or language use were committed from the third person, compared to when such behaviors were committed from the users themselves. These findings suggest that AI users perceive AI robots as partially moral and responsible agents. In conclusion, this study contributes to the study of communication in that it offers both an ethical guideline that can be applied to the use of AI and an opportunity that promotes empirical studies relevant to ethical issues in the study of communication.",,第1页.xls
313,Exploring the Role of Trust During Human-AI Collaboration in Managerial Decision-Making Processes,2022,"Despite the growing popularity of using ArtificialIntelligence-based (AI-based) models to assist human decision-makers, little is known about how managers in business environments approach AI-assisted decision-making. To this end, our research is guided by two questions: (1) What facets make the Human (Manager)-AI decision-making process trustworthy, and (2) Does trust in AI depend on the degree to which the AI agent is humanized? We blended the business and human-computer interaction fields by considering AI applications' design from both a social and a technological angle to answer these research questions. Our results show that (a) AI is preferred for operational versus strategic decisions, as well as for decisions that indirectly affect individuals, (b) the ability to interpret the decision-making process of AI agents would help improve user trust and alleviate calibration bias, (c) humanoid interaction styles such as conversations were believed to improve the interpretability of the decision-making process, and (d) organizational change management was essential for adopting AI technologies, more so than with previous emerging technologies. Additionally, our survey analysis indicates that when interpretability and model confidence are present in the decision-making process involving an AI agent, higher trustworthiness scores are observed.",,第1页.xls
314,Human performance consequences of normative and contrastive explanations: An experiment in machine learning for reliability maintenance,2023,"Decision aids based on artificial intelligence and machine learning can benefit human decisions and system performance, but can also provide incorrect advice, and invite operators to inappropriately rely on automation. This paper examined the extent to which example-based explanations could improve reliance on a decision aid that is based on machine learning. Participants engaged in a preventive maintenance task by providing their diagnosis of the conditions of three components of a hydraulic system. A decision aid based on machine learning provided advice but was not always reliable. Three explanation displays (baseline, normative, normative plus contrastive) were manipulated within-participants. With the normative explanation display, we found improvements in participants' decision time and subjective workload. With the addition of contrastive explanations, we found improvements in participants' hit rate and sensitivity in discriminating between correct and incorrect ML advice. Implications for the design of explainable interfaces to support human-AI interaction in data intensive environments are discussed.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第1页.xls
315,"Emerging Reliance Behaviors in Human-AI Text Generation: Hallucinations, Data Quality Assessment, and Cognitive Forcing Functions",2024,"In this paper, we investigate the impact of hallucinations and cognitive forcing functions in human-AI collaborative text generation tasks, focusing on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in generating high-quality conversational data. LLMs require data for fine-tuning, a crucial step in enhancing their performance. In the context of conversational customer support, the data takes the form of a conversation between a human customer and an agent and can be generated with an AI assistant. In our inquiry, involving 11 users who each completed 8 tasks, resulting in a total of 88 tasks, we found that the presence of hallucinations negatively impacts the quality of data. We also find that, although the cognitive forcing function does not always mitigate the detrimental effects of hallucinations on data quality, the presence of cognitive forcing functions and hallucinations together impacts data quality and influences how users leverage the AI responses presented to them. Our analysis of user behavior reveals distinct patterns of reliance on AI-generated responses, highlighting the importance of managing hallucinations in AI-generated content within conversational AI contexts.",,第1页.xls

317,"Influencing human-AI interaction by priming beliefs about AI can increase perceived trustworthiness, empathy and effectiveness",2023,"As conversational agents powered by large language models become more human-like, users are starting to view them as companions rather than mere assistants. Our study explores how changes to a person's mental model of an AI system affects their interaction with the system. Participants interacted with the same conversational AI, but were influenced by different priming statements regarding the AI's inner motives: caring, manipulative or no motives. Here we show that those who perceived a caring motive for the AI also perceived it as more trustworthy, empathetic and better-performing, and that the effects of priming and initial mental models were stronger for a more sophisticated AI model. Our work also indicates a feedback loop in which the user and AI reinforce the user's mental model over a short time; further work should investigate long-term effects. The research highlights the importance of how AI systems are introduced can notably affect the interaction and how the AI is experienced.The recent accessibility of large language models brought them into contact with a large number of users and, due to the social nature of language, it is hard to avoid prescribing human characteristics such as intentions to a chatbot. Pataranutaporn and colleagues investigated how framing a bot as helpful or manipulative can influence this perception and the behaviour of the humans that interact with it.",,第1页.xls
318,Diverse Conventions for Human-AI Collaboration [arXiv],2023,"Conventions are crucial for strong performance in cooperative multi-agent games, because they allow players to coordinate on a shared strategy without explicit communication. Unfortunately, standard multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, such as self-play, converge to conventions that are arbitrary and non-diverse, leading to poor generalization when interacting with new partners. In this work, we present a technique for generating diverse conventions by (1) maximizing their rewards during self-play, while (2) minimizing their rewards when playing with previously discovered conventions (cross-play), stimulating conventions to be semantically different. To ensure that learned policies act in good faith despite the adversarial optimization of cross-play, we introduce mixed-play, where an initial state is randomly generated by sampling self-play and cross-play transitions and the player learns to maximize the self-play reward from this initial state. We analyze the benefits of our technique on various multi-agent collaborative games, including Overcooked, and find that our technique can adapt to the conventions of humans, surpassing human-level performance when paired with real users.",,第1页.xls
319,COLLABORATIVE DESIGN DECISION-MAKING WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: EXPLORING THE EVOLUTION AND IMPACT OF HUMAN CONFIDENCE IN AI AND IN THEMSELVES,2022,"Decision-making assistance by artificial intelligence (AI) during design is only effective when human designers properly utilize AI input. However, designers often misjudge the AI's and/or their own ability, leading to erroneous reliance on AI and therefore bad designs. To avoid such outcomes, it is critical to understand the evolution of designers' confidence in both their AI teammate(s) and themselves during human-AI collaboration. Therefore, this work conducts a cognitive study to explore how experiencing various and changing (without notice) AI performance levels and feedback affects these confidences and consequently the decisions to accept or reject AI suggestions. The results first reveal that designers' confidence in an AI agent changes with poor, but not with good, AI performance. Interestingly, designers' self-confidence initially remains unaffected by AI accuracy; however, when the accuracy changes, self-confidence decreases regardless of the direction of the change. Moreover, this work finds that designers tend to infer flawed information from feedback, resulting in inappropriate levels of confidence in both the AI and themselves. Confidence in the AI and in themselves is also shown to affect designers' probability of accepting AI input in opposite directions. Finally, results that are uniquely applicable to design are identified by comparing the findings from this work to those from a similar study conducted with a non-design task. Overall, this work offers valuable insights that may enable prevention and detection of designers' inappropriate confidence and their consequent misuse of AI in design.",,第1页.xls

The results of this review consolidate research findings on chatbots' affordances, which must be taken into consideration when chatbot-based services are designed and deployed. Specifically, the review of state-of-the-art literature led to the identification of nine high level affordances: Human Like Conversing, Assistance Provision, Facilitation, Distilling Information, Enriching Information, Context Identification, Personalization, Fostering Familiarity and Ensuring Privacy. Our contribution is twofold. First, we map the chatbot affordances identified in prior research and group them in higher-level, overarching affordances through a thematic analysis.

321,On the Emergence of Symmetrical Reality [arXiv],2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized human cognitive abilities and facilitated the development of new AI entities capable of interacting with humans in both physical and virtual environments. Despite the existence of virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality for several years, integrating these technical fields remains a formidable challenge due to their disparate application directions. The advent of AI agents, capable of autonomous perception and action, further compounds this issue by exposing the limitations of traditional human-centered research approaches. It is imperative to establish a comprehensive framework that accommodates the dual perceptual centers of humans and AI agents in both physical and virtual worlds. In this paper, we introduce the symmetrical reality framework, which offers a unified representation encompassing various forms of physical-virtual amalgamations. This framework enables researchers to better comprehend how AI agents can collaborate with humans and how distinct technical pathways of physical-virtual integration can be consolidated from a broader perspective. We then delve into the coexistence of humans and AI, demonstrating a prototype system that exemplifies the operation of symmetrical reality systems for specific tasks, such as pouring water. Subsequently, we propose an instance of an AI-driven active assistance service that illustrates the potential applications of symmetrical reality. This paper aims to offer beneficial perspectives and guidance for researchers and practitioners in different fields, thus contributing to the ongoing research about human-AI coexistence in both physical and virtual environments.",,第1页.xls
322,Tackling Cooperative Incompatibility forZero-Shot Human-AI Coordination,2024,"Securing coordination between AI agent and teammates (human players or AI agents) in contexts involving unfamiliar humans continues to pose a significant challenge in Zero-Shot Coordination. The issue of cooperative incompatibility becomes particularly prominent when an AI agent is unsuccessful in synchronizing with certain previously unknown partners. Traditional algorithms have aimed to collaborate with partners by optimizing fixed objectives within a population, fostering diversity in strategies and behaviors. However, these techniques may lead to learning loss and an inability to cooperate with specific strategies within the population, a phenomenon named cooperative incompatibility in learning. In order to solve cooperative incompatibility in learning and effectively address the problem in the context of ZSC, we introduce the Cooperative Open-ended Learning (COLE)framework, which formulates open-ended objectives in cooperative games with two players using perspectives of graph theory to evaluate and pinpoint the cooperative capacity of each strategy. We present two practical algorithms, specifically COLESV and COLER, which in corporate insights from game theory and graph theory. We also show that COLE could effectively overcome the cooperative incompatibility from theoretical and empirical analysis. Subsequently, we created an online Overcooked human-AI experiment platform, the COLE platform, which enables easy customization of questionnaires, model weights, and other aspects. Utilizing the COLE platform, we enlist 130 participants for human experiments. Our findings reveal a preference for our approach over state-of-the-art methods using a variety of subjective metrics. Moreover, objective experimental outcomes in the Over cooked game environment indicate that our method surpasses existing ones when coordinating with previously unencountered AI agents and the human proxy model.

323,Conceptual Metaphors Impact Perceptions of Human-AI Collaboration [arXiv],2020,"With the emergence of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) agents, it is important to understand the mechanisms that influence users' experiences of these agents. We study a common tool in the designer's toolkit: conceptual metaphors. Metaphors can present an agent as akin to a wry teenager, a toddler, or an experienced butler. How might a choice of metaphor influence our experience of the AI agent? Sampling metaphors along the dimensions of warmth and competencedefined by psychological theories as the primary axes of variation for human social perceptionwe perform a study (N=260) where we manipulate the metaphor, but not the behavior, of a Wizard-of-Oz conversational agent. Following the experience, participants are surveyed about their intention to use the agent, their desire to cooperate with the agent, and the agent's usability. Contrary to the current tendency of designers to use high competence metaphors to describe AI products, we find that metaphors that signal low competence lead to better evaluations of the agent than metaphors that signal high competence. This effect persists despite both high and low competence agents featuring human-level performance and the wizards being blind to condition. A second study confirms that intention to adopt decreases rapidly as competence projected by the metaphor increases. In a third study, we assess effects of metaphor choices on potential users' desire to try out the system and find that users are drawn to systems that project higher competence and warmth. These results suggest that projecting competence may help attract new users, but those users may discard the agent unless it can quickly correct with a lower competence metaphor. We close with a retrospective analysis that finds similar patterns between metaphors and user attitudes towards past conversational agents such as Xiaoice, Replika, Woebot, Mitsuku, and Tay.",,第1页.xls

One of the key challenges here is AI influence-an aspect that seems largely unaddressed in current debates around AI Ethics. In this paper, I aim to shed some light on the notion of AI influence and the problems that surround it. This paper is split up into two parts. First, I will elaborate on what exactly I mean by AI influence. For this, I will introduce what I call the objectivity-fallacy and will differentiate between intended and unintended AI influence.

325,I am attracted to myCoolSmart Assistant! Analyzing Attachment-Aversion in AI-Human Relationships,2023,"The conversation between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled intelligent voice assistants (IVA) can create bonds that go beyond a mere utilitarian purpose. The emotional cues in a Human-AI conversation can lead consumers to feel connected with the AI-agents and even consider such a relationship ascool. Although brand coolness is known to affect consumer behavior, little is known about how consumers perceive a close relationship with IVAs and what the drivers of their use or avoidance are. Therefore, the current paper adds to the literature by analyzing how AI-enabled voice assistant experience affects IVA coolness and customer-brand relationships using the attachment-aversion (A-A) theory. A total of 308 consumers showed that affective, behavioral, and intellectual experiences with the intelligent voice assistant affect IVA coolness. IVA coolness was also found to affect A-A relationships positively, influencing consumers' motivational strength to adopt, maintain and enhance the relationship in the future.

326,Achieving Trust in Future Human Interactions with Omnipresent AI: Some Postulates,2022,"Trust is a fundamental ingredient of interaction, especially in high-responsibility roles where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is predicated to use its faculties to empower a user. Present AI systems are too limited in their programmes and approaches as they appear to lack an ability to perceive their purpose and learn the user's needs. This leaves much uncertainty when the system is engaged in processes with wide range of possibilities such as driving a car. Users find difficulty in ascertaining the AI's control of the situation with current human-computer interaction methods. It is hoped that this paper will show AI researchers developing a direction for such interactions to understand the basis behind a trustworthy social AI. This paper presents postulates on future human interaction with what we call omnipresent AI based on trust. This is done through establishing elements of interaction which are present in human-to-human communication, based on Speech-Act and Communicative Action Theory. The factors which contribute to an Omnipresent AI being recognised as an intelligent being are also laid out, which together forms the principles behind trustworthy Human-AI interaction. The paper then proceeds to propose a form which the omnipresent AI could take, based on earlier studies done by the authors.",,第1页.xls
327,Content Moderation on Social Media: Does It Matter Who and Why Moderates Hate Speech?,2023,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated into content moderation to detect and remove hate speech on social media. An online experiment (N=478) was conducted to examine how moderation agents (AI vs. human vs. human-AI collaboration) and removal explanations (with vs. without) affect users' perceptions and acceptance of removal decisions for hate speech targeting social groups with certain characteristics, such as religion or sexual orientation. The results showed that individuals exhibit consistent levels of perceived trustworthiness and acceptance of removal decisions regardless of the type of moderation agent. When explanations for the content takedown were provided, removal decisions made jointly by humans and AI were perceived as more trustworthy than the same decisions made by humans alone, which increased users' willingness to accept the verdict. However, this moderated mediation effect was only significant when Muslims, not homosexuals, were the target of hate speech.",,第1页.xls
328,Dynamic Knowledge Injection for AIXI Agents,2024,"Prior approximations of AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement learning, can only approximate AIXI's Bayesian environment model using an a-priori defined set of models. This is a fundamental source of epistemic uncertainty for the agent in settings where the existence of systematic bias in the predefined model class cannot be resolved by simply collecting more data from the environment. We address this issue in the context of Human-AI teaming by considering a setup where additional knowledge for the agent in the form of new candidate models arrives from a human operator in an online fashion. We introduce a new agent called DynamicHedgeAIXI that maintains an exact Bayesian mixture over dynamically changing sets of models via a time-adaptive prior constructed from a variant of the Hedge algorithm. The DynamicHedgeAIXI agent is the richest direct approximation of AIXI known to date and comes with good performance guarantees.

The interactive experience allows the user to seek inspiration collaborating with the AI agent as needed. In this paper, we study how the visual and conceptual similarity of the inspiring design from the AI partner influences design ideation by examining the effect on design ideation during a design task. Our findings show that the AI-based stimuli produce ideation outcomes with more variety and novelty when compared to random stimuli.",,第1页.xls
330,Understanding the design space of ai-mediated social interaction in online learning: challenges and opportunities,2022,"Our online interactions are constantly mediated through Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially our social interactions. AI-mediated social interaction is the AI-facilitated process of building and maintaining social connections between individuals through information inferred from people's online posts. With its impending application across a number of contexts, the challenges and opportunities of AI-mediated social interaction remain underexplored. This paper seeks to understand the design space of AI-mediated social interaction in the context of online learning, where students frequently face social isolation. We deployed an AI agent named SAMI in three class discussion forums to help online learners build social connections. Using SAMI as a probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 students to understand their difficulties in remote social interactions and their experiences with SAMI. Through the lenses of social translucence and social-technical gap, we illustrate online learners' difficulties in remote social interactions and how SAMI resolved some of the difficulties. We also identify potential ethical and social challenges of SAMI such as user agency and privacy. Based on our findings, we outline the design space of AI-mediated social interaction. We discuss the design tension between AI performance and ethical design and pinpoint two design opportunities for AI-mediated social interaction in designing towards human-AI collaborative social matching and artificial serendipity.",,第1页.xls
331,AI and Ethics When Human Beings Collaborate With AI Agents.,2022,"The relationship between a human being and an AI system has to be considered as a collaborative process between two agents during the performance of an activity. When there is a collaboration between two people, a fundamental characteristic of that collaboration is that there is co-supervision, with each agent supervising the actions of the other. Such supervision ensures that the activity achieves its objectives, but it also means that responsibility for the consequences of the activity is shared. If there is no co-supervision, neither collaborator can be held co-responsible for the actions of the other. When the collaboration is between a person and an AI system, co-supervision is also necessary to ensure that the objectives of the activity are achieved, but this also means that there is co-responsibility for the consequences of the activities. Therefore, if each agent's responsibility for the consequences of the activity depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of the supervision that that agent performs over the other agent's actions, it will be necessary to take into account the way in which that supervision is carried out and the factors on which it depends. In the case of the human supervision of the actions of an AI system, there is a wealth of psychological research that can help us to establish cognitive and non-cognitive boundaries and their relationship to the responsibility of humans collaborating with AI systems. There is also psychological research on how an external observer supervises and evaluates human actions. This research can be used to programme AI systems in such a way that the boundaries of responsibility for AI systems can be established. In this article, we will describe some examples of how such research on the task of supervising the actions of another agent can be used to establish lines of shared responsibility between a human being and an AI system. The article will conclude by proposing that we should develop a methodology for assessing responsibility based on the results of the collaboration between a human being and an AI agent during the performance of one common activity.",,第1页.xls
332,Explainable AI for medical imaging: Explaining pneumothorax diagnoses with Bayesian Teaching,2021,"Limited expert time is a key bottleneck in medical imaging. Due to advances in image classification, AI can now serve as decision-support for medical experts, with the potential for great gains in radiologist productivity and, by extension, public health. However, these gains are contingent on building and maintaining experts' trust in the AI agents. Explainable AI may build such trust by helping medical experts to understand the AI decision processes behind diagnostic judgements. Here we introduce and evaluate explanations based on Bayesian Teaching, a formal account of explanation rooted in the cognitive science of human learning. We find that medical experts exposed to explanations generated by Bayesian Teaching successfully predict the AI's diagnostic decisions and are more likely to certify the AI for cases when the AI is correct than when it is wrong, indicating appropriate trust. These results show that Explainable AI can be used to support human-AI collaboration in medical imaging.",,第1页.xls

335,Toward More Human-Like AI Communication: A Review of Emergent Communication Research,2023,"In the recent shift towards human-centric AI, the need for machines to accurately use natural language has become increasingly important. While a common approach to achieve this is to train large language models, this method presents a form of learning misalignment where the model may not capture the underlying structure and reasoning humans employ in using natural language, potentially leading to unexpected or unreliable behavior. Emergent communication (EmCom) is a field of research that has seen a growing number of publications in recent years, aiming to develop artificial agents capable of using natural language in a way that goes beyond simple discriminative tasks and can effectively communicate and learn new concepts. In this review, we present EmCom under two aspects. Firstly, we delineate all the common proprieties we find across the literature and how they relate to human interactions. Secondly, we identify two subcategories and highlight their characteristics and open challenges. We encourage researchers to work together by demonstrating that different methods can be viewed as diverse solutions to a common problem and emphasize the importance of including diverse perspectives and expertise in the field. We believe a deeper understanding of human communication and human-AI trust dynamics are crucial to develop machines that can accurately use natural language in human-machine interactions.",,第1页.xls
336,Human-AI collaboration: Unraveling the effects of user proficiency and AI agent capability in intelligent decision support systems,2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are integral components of modern intelligent decision support systems (IDSS), providing their capability to assist in decision-making processes. Understanding the influence of AI involvement on human responses within these systems is crucial for fostering appropriate reliance on AI advice and ensuring a comfortable user experience. This study delves into the impact of AI agents on decision change, correct rate change, confidence rate change and pleasure rating among users. It explores the main and interactive effects of user proficiency and AI agent capability on user responses. A block-factorial experiment involving 45 participants was conducted. The results indicated that high-capability AI agents were associated with substantial decision change, correct rate change and confidence rate change. Participants with higher proficiency, both subjectively and objectively, exhibited reduced reliance on AI agents for task execution. Notably, the involvement of AI agents led to a slight decline in correct rates for participants of high competence (i.e., participants' independent correct rate exceeds AI agent capability), while still enhancing their confidence levels. Additionally, agents lacking human-like embodiment tended to enhance participants' pleasure ratings. Individual differences in gender, collaboration experience with AI agent, and stereotype on AI agent capability also shaped the decision changes and pleasure ratings of participants. These findings underscore the presence of complementary competence interaction between user and AI agent within IDSS, and can be applied in designing capability of advisory AI agents with consideration of user proficiency and individual characteristics. Relevance to industry: The findings can be used as guidelines for designing AI agents and specifying their application strategies to integrate the assistance of AI agents effectively in intelligent decision support systems.",,第1页.xls
337,Conceptual Metaphors Impact Perceptions of Human-AI Collaboration,2020,"With the emergence of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) agents, it is important to understand the mechanisms that influence users' experiences of these agents. In this paper, we study one of the most common tools in the designer's toolkit: conceptual metaphors. Metaphors can present an agent as akin to a wry teenager, a toddler, or an experienced butler. How might a choice of metaphor influence our experience of the AI agent? Sampling a set of metaphors along the dimensions of warmth and competence---defined by psychological theories as the primary axes of variation for human social perception---we perform a study (N=260) where we manipulate the metaphor, but not the behavior, of a Wizard-of-Oz conversational agent. Following the experience, participants are surveyed about their intention to use the agent, their desire to cooperate with the agent, and the agent's usability. Contrary to the current tendency of designers to use high competence metaphors to describe AI products, we find that metaphors that signal low competence lead to better evaluations of the agent than metaphors that signal high competence. This effect persists despite both high and low competence agents featuring identical, human-level performance and the wizards being blind to condition. A second study confirms that intention to adopt decreases rapidly as competence projected by the metaphor increases. In a third study, we assess effects of metaphor choices on potential users' desire to try out the system and find that users are drawn to systems that project higher competence and warmth. These results suggest that projecting competence may help attract new users, but those users may discard the agent unless it can quickly correct with a lower competence metaphor. We close with a retrospective analysis that finds similar patterns between metaphors and user attitudes towards past conversational agents such as Xiaoice, Replika, Woebot, Mitsuku, and Tay.",,第1页.xls
338,Emergence of cooperation in the one-shot Prisoner's dilemma through Discriminatory and Samaritan AIs,2024,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly embedded in our lives, their presence leads to interactions that shape our behaviour, decision-making and social interactions. Existing theoretical research on the emergence and stability of cooperation, particularly in the context of social dilemmas, has primarily focused on human-to-human interactions, overlooking the unique dynamics triggered by the presence of AI. Resorting to methods from evolutionary game theory, we study how different forms of AI can influence cooperation in a population of human-like agents playing the one-shot Prisoner's dilemma game. We found that Samaritan AI agents who help everyone unconditionally, including defectors, can promote higher levels of cooperation in humans than Discriminatory AI that only helps those considered worthy/cooperative, especially in slow-moving societies where change based on payoff difference is moderate (small intensities of selection). Only in fast-moving societies (high intensities of selection), Discriminatory AIs promote higher levels of cooperation than Samaritan AIs. Furthermore, when it is possible to identify whether a co-player is a human or an AI, we found that cooperation is enhanced when human-like agents disregard AI performance. Our findings provide novel insights into the design and implementation of context-dependent AI systems for addressing social dilemmas.",,第1页.xls
339,AI as a Citizen: Eliciting Smart City Future Stories through Human-AI Collaborative Fiction Writing,2024,"Smart cities are becoming an inevitable trend in the design of urban futures. With the speed of technological advancement, by the time that smart city visions come to life, the urban environment could already be seen as a co-living space of humans and technological entities, such as Artificial Intelligence. This raises the question of whether these future visions should get already co-created by both people and technology, especially given AI's potential role as a decision-making agent in data-driven smart city visions (e.g. urban planning). In this workshop, we aim to explore how visions of smart city futures can be co-speculated by people and AI through the collaborative process of writing fiction. Through writing short speculative stories, we want to encourage participants to critically reflect on their own expectations about smart city futures, as well as on what values these should preferably be based on. Moreover, we will analyze and discuss the future narratives and potential biases that AI might bring into the process of futuring.",,第1页.xls
340,"A Smart Advisor for Software Delivery - a Bot framework for Awareness, Alerts and Advice",2019,"Software engineers typically rely on mental models of their project and peers for project-specific insights important to their work. Ever expanding software size and complexity makes it strenuous to maintain such mental models and leads to subjectivity. At the same time, consistent peer interactions lead to interrupts, thereby hampering productivity. Moreover, due to client mandates, typical project environments employ a plethora of heterogeneous tools, thus making the information retrieval process fairly complex. We believe that 'digital coworkers' leveraging Human-AI collaboration, have huge potential here to help out with such challenges. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Smart Advisor, an intelligence augmentation bot that employs domain and knowledge modeling and in-process analytics to automatically provide important insights (alerts and advice) and answer queries (awareness), using a conversational and interactive user interface.",,第1页.xls
341,Understanding the Dynamics in Creating Domain-Specific AI Design Guidelines: A Case Study of a Leading Digital Finance Company in South Korea,2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) significantly impacts the user experience (UX) across a wide range of products and services. However, many practitioners find it challenging to design the UX for AI-enhanced products. Although there are human-AI interaction design guidelines available, they are often too generic to fully address domain-specific challenges in fields such as finance and healthcare. Additionally, they sometimes overlook the constraints imposed by different working environments. In this research, we conducted a case study at one of the leading financial corporations in South Korea to develop their own AI product interaction guidelines. We interviewed 13 practitioners including bank UX practitioners, design agency UX designers, and academic UX researchers who were involved in this initiative, to gather insights into their experiences with crafting these guidelines. Our findings revealed a mixed reception towards existing AI design resources among practitioners, underscoring the necessity to incorporate elements specific to banking services, such as the company's customer experience (CX) principles, overarching agent personas, multifaceted channels, and diverse interaction modalities. We also observed the importance of understanding the dynamics among various stakeholders within a company. We discuss the implications and design considerations for creating domain-specific resources specialized in AI interactions.",,第1页.xls
342,A Hierarchical Approach to Population Training for Human-AI Collaboration [arXiv],2023,"A major challenge for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents is to collaborate with novel partners that were not encountered by them during the training phase. This is specifically worsened by an increased variance in action responses when the DRL agents collaborate with human partners due to the lack of consistency in human behaviors. Recent work have shown that training a single agent as the best response to a diverse population of training partners significantly increases an agent's robustness to novel partners. We further enhance the population-based training approach by introducing a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) based method for Human-AI Collaboration. Our agent is able to learn multiple best-response policies as its low-level policy while at the same time, it learns a high-level policy that acts as a manager which allows the agent to dynamically switch between the low-level best-response policies based on its current partner. We demonstrate that our method is able to dynamically adapt to novel partners of different play styles and skill levels in the 2-player collaborative Overcooked game environment. We also conducted a human study in the same environment to test the effectiveness of our method when partnering with real human subjects.",,第1页.xls
343,StoryBuddy: A Human-AI Collaborative Chatbot for Parent-Child Interactive Storytelling with Flexible Parental Involvement,2022,"Despite its benefits for children's skill development and parentchild bonding, many parents do not often engage in interactive storytelling by having story-related dialogues with their child due to limited availability or challenges in coming up with appropriate questions. While recent advances made AI generation of questions from stories possible, the fully-automated approach excludes parent involvement, disregards educational goals, and underoptimizes for child engagement. Informed by need-finding interviews and participatory design (PD) results, we developed StoryBuddy, an AI-enabled system for parents to create interactive storytelling experiences. StoryBuddy's design highlighted the need for accommodating dynamic user needs between the desire for parent involvement and parent-child bonding and the goal of minimizing parent intervention when busy. The PD revealed varied assessment and educational goals of parents, which StoryBuddy addressed by supporting configuring question types and tracking child progress. A user study validated StoryBuddy's usability and suggested design insights for future parent-AI collaboration systems.",,第1页.xls
344,Explicable Planning as Minimizing Distance from Expected Behavior,2019,"In order to achieve effective human-AI collaboration, it is necessary for an AI agent to align its behavior with the human's expectations. When the agent generates a task plan without such considerations, it may often result in inexplicable behavior from the human's point of view. This may have serious implications for the human, from increased cognitive load to more serious concerns of safety around the physical agent. In this work, we present an approach to generate explicable behavior by minimizing the distance between the agent's plan and the plan expected by the human. To this end, we learn a mapping between plan distances (distances between expected and agent plans) and human's plan scoring scheme. The plan generation process uses this learned model as a heuristic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a delivery robot domain.",,第1页.xls
345,Investigating the effect of Mental Models in User Interaction with an Adaptive Dialog Agent,2024,"Mental models play an important role in whether user interaction with intelligent systems, such as dialog systems is successful or not. Adaptive dialog systems present the opportunity to align a dialog agent's behavior with heterogeneous user expectations. However, there has been little research into what mental models users form when interacting with a task-oriented dialog system, how these models affect users' interactions, or what role system adaptation can play in this process, making it challenging to avoid damage to human-AI partnership. In this work, we collect a new publicly available dataset for exploring user mental models about information seeking dialog systems. We demonstrate that users have a variety of conflicting mental models about such systems, the validity of which directly impacts the success of their interactions and perceived usability of system. Furthermore, we show that adapting a dialog agent's behavior to better align with users' mental models, even when done implicitly, can improve perceived usability, dialog efficiency, and success. To this end, we argue that implicit adaptation can be a valid strategy for task-oriented dialog systems, so long as developers first have a solid understanding of users' mental models.",,第1页.xls
346,Artificial Interaction: Power and Labour in the Digital Society,2024,"Polycentricity theory is predicated on the existence of multiple decision-making centres within a metropolitan area, collectively using a mutually agreed conventional system of governance. The digital transformation has increasingly integrated agentic computational artefacts (or artificial intelligence systems) into these social arrangements, thereby extending the concept of polycentricity to encompass 'digital polycentricity.' Digital polycentricity can be examined through four distinct 'lenses': interactional, governmental, architectural, and axiological. In this paper, we employ the interactional lens to study artificial interaction. Our analysis highlights several critical issues related to power and labour in the digital society. To mitigate these issues, we propose two strategies for developing Value-Sensitive Operationalisation (VSO), a framework aimed at guiding the creation of socio-technical systems that are fit-for-purpose and contextually appropriate. These strategies include: 1) leveraging digital data objects to support collective action, and 2) embedding a sense of place in the design of algorithms. By using these strategies, VSO practitioners can develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems that effectively meet user needs and cultivate a human-AI relationship designed to re-empower human stakeholders.",,第1页.xls
347,Coupling Asymmetry Optimizes Collective Dynamics Over Multiplex Networks,2024,"Networks are often interconnected, with one system wielding greater influence over another. However, the effects of such asymmetry on self-organized phenomena (e.g., consensus and synchronization) are not well understood. Here, we study collective dynamics using a generalized graph Laplacian for multiplex networks containing layers that are asymmetrically coupled. We explore the nonlinear effects of coupling asymmetry on the convergence rate toward a collective state, finding that asymmetry induces one or more optima that maximally accelerate convergence. When a faster and a slower system are coupled, depending on their relative timescales, their optimal coupling is either cooperative (network layers mutually depend on one another) or non-cooperative (one network directs another without a reciprocated influence). It is often optimal for the faster system to more-strongly influence the slower one, yet counter-intuitively, the opposite can also be true. As an application, we model collective decision-making for a human-AI system in which a social network is supported by an AI-agent network, finding that a cooperative optimum requires that these two networks operate on a sufficiently similar timescale. More broadly, our work highlights the optimization of coupling asymmetry and timescale balancing as fundamental concepts for the design of collective behavior over interconnected systems.",,第1页.xls
348,"More Similar Values, More Trust? - the Effect of Value Similarity on Trust in Human-Agent Interaction",2021,"As AI systems are increasingly involved in decision making, it also becomes important that they elicit appropriate levels of trust from their users. To achieve this, it is first important to understand which factors influence trust in AI. We identify that a research gap exists regarding the role of personal values in trust in AI. Therefore, this paper studies how human and agent Value Similarity (VS) influences a human's trust in that agent. To explore this, 89 participants teamed up with five different agents, which were designed with varying levels of value similarity to that of the participants. In a within-subjects, scenario-based experiment, agents gave suggestions on what to do when entering the building to save a hostage. We analyzed the agent's scores on subjective value similarity, trust and qualitative data from open-ended questions. Our results show that agents rated as having more similar values also scored higher on trust, indicating a positive effect between the two. With this result, we add to the existing understanding of human-agent trust by providing insight into the role of value-similarity.",,第1页.xls
349,Cognitive Modeling of Anticipation: Unsupervised Learning and Symbolic Modeling of Pilots' Mental Representations.,2022,"The ability to anticipate team members' actions enables joint action towards a common goal. Task knowledge and mental simulation allow for anticipating other agents' actions and for making inferences about their underlying mental representations. In human-AI teams, providing AI agents with anticipatory mechanisms can facilitate collaboration and successful execution of joint action. This paper presents a computational cognitive model demonstrating mental simulation of operators' mental models of a situation and anticipation of their behavior. The work proposes two successive steps: (1) A hierarchical cluster algorithm is applied to recognize patterns of behavior among pilots. These behavioral clusters are used to derive commonalities in situation models from empirical data (N = 13 pilots). (2) An ACT-R (adaptive control of thought - rational) cognitive model is implemented to mentally simulate different possible outcomes of action decisions and timing of a pilot. model tracing of ACT-R allows following up on operators' individual actions. Two models are implemented using the symbolic representations of ACT-R: one simulating normative behavior and the other by simulating individual differences and using subsymbolic learning. Model performance is analyzed by a comparison of both models. Results indicate the improved performance of the individual differences over the normative model and are discussed regarding implications for cognitive assistance capable of anticipating operatorbehavior.",,第1页.xls

To this end, it is desirable to have human involvement in the customer servicing process.

351,"Explanation, Debate, Align: A Weak-to-Strong Framework for Language Model Generalization",2024,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence systems has brought the challenge of AI alignment to the forefront of research, particularly in complex decision-making and task execution. As these systems surpass human-level performance in sophisticated problems, ensuring their alignment with human values, intentions, and ethical guidelines becomes crucial. Building on previous work in explanation generation for human-agent alignment, we address the more complex dynamics of multi-agent systems and human-AI teams. This paper introduces a novel approach to model alignment through weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language models. We present a framework where a strong model facilitates the improvement of a weaker model, bridging the gap between explanation generation and model alignment. Our method, formalized as a facilitation function, allows for the transfer of capabilities from advanced models to less capable ones without direct access to extensive training data. Our results suggest that this facilitation-based approach not only enhances model performance but also provides insights into the nature of model alignment and the potential for scalable oversight of AI systems.",,第1页.xls

We introduce 'ORIBA', a customizable AI chatbot that enables illustrators to converse with their OCs. This approach allows artists to not only receive responses from their OCs but also to observe their inner monologues and behavior. Despite the existing tension between artists and AI, our study explores innovative collaboration methods that are inspiring to illustrators.

353,Toward Co-creative Dungeon Generation via Transfer Learning,2021,"Co-creative Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) refers to systems where a PCGML agent and a human work together to produce output content. One of the limitations of co-creative PCGML is that it requires co-creative training data for a PCGML agent to learn to interact with humans. However, acquiring this data is a difficult and time-consuming process. In this work, we propose approximating human-AI interaction data and employing transfer learning to adapt learned co-creative knowledge from one game to a different game. We explore this approach for co-creative Zelda dungeon room generation.",,第1页.xls
354,Investigating a Mixed-Initiative Workflow for Digital Mind-Mapping,2020,"In this paper, we report on our investigation of human-AI collaboration for mind-mapping. We specifically focus on problem exploration in pre-conceptualization stages of early design. Our approach leverages the notion of query expansion-the process of refining a given search query for improving information retrieval. Assuming a mind-map as a network of nodes, we reformulate its construction process as a sequential interaction workflow wherein a human user and an intelligent agent take turns to add one node to the network at a time. Our contribution is the design, implementation, and evaluation of algorithm that powers the intelligent agent (IA). This paper is an extension of our prior work (Chen et al., 2019, Mini-Map: Mixed-Initiative Mind-Mapping Via Contextual Query Expansion, AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum, p. 2347) wherein we developed this algorithm, dubbed Mini-Map, and implemented a web-based workflow enabled by ConceptNet (a large graph-based representation of commonsense knowledge). In this paper, we extend our prior work through a comprehensive comparison between human-AI collaboration and human-human collaboration for mind-mapping. We specifically extend our prior work by: (a) expanding on our previous quantitative analysis using established metrics and semantic studies, (b) presenting a new detailed video protocol analysis of the mind-mapping process, and (c) providing design implications for digital mind-mapping tools.",,第1页.xls
355,Plan Explanations as Model Reconciliation - An Empirical Study,2019,"Recent work in explanation generation for decision making agents has looked at how unexplained behavior of autonomous systems can be understood in terms of differences in the model of the system and the human's understanding of the same, and how the explanation process as a result of this mismatch can be then seen as a process of reconciliation of these models. Existing algorithms in such settings, while having been built on contrastive, selective and social properties of explanations as studied extensively in the psychology literature, have not, to the best of our knowledge, been evaluated in settings with actual humans in the loop. As such, the applicability of such explanations to human-AI and human-robot interactions remains suspect. In this paper, we set out to evaluate these explanation generation algorithms in a series of studies in a mock search and rescue scenario with an internal semi-autonomous robot and an external human commander. During that process, we hope to demonstrate to what extent the properties of these algorithms hold as they are evaluated by humans.",,第1页.xls

357,DECI: A Tutorial on Designing Effective Conversational Interfaces,2023,"Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) have been argued to have advantages over traditional GUIs due to having a more human-like interaction. The growing popularity of conversational agents has enabled humans to interact with machines more naturally. There is an increasing familiarity among people with conversational interactions mediated by technology due to the widespread use of mobile devices and messaging services and a hungry market for conversational agents. Based on the recent advances in conversational AI, as a result of the proliferation of large language models, the signs are that the future of human-computer interaction will have a significant conversational component. Today, over two-thirds of the population on our planet has access to the Internet, with ever-lowering barriers to accessibility. This tutorial will showcase the benefits of employing novel conversational interfaces for crowd computing, human-AI decision making, health and well-being, and information retrieval. Given the widespread adoption of AI systems across several domains, we will discuss the potential of conversational interfaces in facilitating and mediating people's interactions with AI systems. The tutorial will include interactive elements and discussions and provide participants with insights to inform the design of effective conversational interfaces.",,第1页.xls
358,Informed AI Regulation: Comparing the Ethical Frameworks of Leading LLM Chatbots Using an Ethics-Based Audit to Assess Moral Reasoning and Normative Values [arXiv],2024,"With the rise of individual and collaborative networks of autonomous agents, AI is deployed in more key reasoning and decision-making roles. For this reason, ethics-based audits play a pivotal role in the rapidly growing fields of AI safety and regulation. This paper undertakes an ethics-based audit to probe the 8 leading commercial and open-source Large Language Models including GPT-4. We assess explicability and trustworthiness by a) establishing how well different models engage in moral reasoning and b) comparing normative values underlying models as ethical frameworks. We employ an experimental, evidence-based approach that challenges the models with ethical dilemmas in order to probe human-AI alignment. The ethical scenarios are designed to require a decision in which the particulars of the situation may or may not necessitate deviating from normative ethical principles. A sophisticated ethical framework was consistently elicited in one model, GPT-4. Nonetheless, troubling findings include underlying normative frameworks with clear bias towards particular cultural norms. Many models also exhibit disturbing authoritarian tendencies.

During storytelling, children need creative support and are subjected to cognitive challenges. This paper explores a co-creative agent - StoryDrawer, which supports children in creating oral stories through collaborative drawing. StoryDrawer works with children in two strategies: Child says and AI draws; and Child scribbles and AI completes. These two collaborative strategies allow children to draw their stories as an externalization and provoke unexpected ideas. This paper presents the interaction design, collaborative strategies and implementation of StoryDrawer, and conducts a user study for the fun and task effectiveness of StoryDrawer. The results reveal that our system can encourage children's active participation in storytelling and help them create novel stories through human-computer collaboration.",,第1页.xls
360,A New Matrix Model for Human-AI Integration,2022,"This paper has the goal to describe the introduction of an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) in a human organization. An organization may be composed of project leaders (vertical communication), human and non-human operations, an AGI machine that manages horizontal communication and big data. This leads to the paradigm of the Organizational Great Machine (GM) in which humans benefit from upgrade or empowerment provided by an all-encompassing artificial intelligence. An AGI has a substrate that uses Multi Agent System (MAS) where the model of an agent is defined as a belief, desire, intention (BDI) model of an agent augmented with Situations and Action (SBDIA). This provides a way of explaining future-directed intention. SBDIA has a natural model consistent with human psychology. Once artificial intelligence is introduced into the organization, we have to design new Human-Machine Integration (HMI) tools to have a successful relationship with human resources. At the end the organizational model of the MAS, called Great machine (GM), is used to provide information and transparency about the behavior of an AGI. A GM's internal model is considered as a knowledge market where knowledge flows among agents. Leontief's economic model emulates this market by providing information on how knowledge flows and how it is used. This permits more transparency and an understanding of internal processes.",,第1页.xls
361,Understanding the Impact of Perceived Empathy on Consumer Preferences for Human and AI Agents in Healthcare and Financial Services,2024,"This study explores variations in preferences for human and AI agents within the medical and financial services. Study 1 investigates whether there are preferential disparities between human and AI agents across these service domains. It finds that human agents are favored over AI agents in medical services, while AI agents receive greater preference in the financial services. Study 2 delves into the underlying reasons for the preference differentials between human and AI agents by assessing the significance of certain capabilities as perceived by users in each domain. The findings reveal a mediating role of perceived empathy importance in the effect of service domains on human-AI preference. Furthermore, perceived empathy is deemed a more critical capability by users for preferring human over AI agents across both service domains compared to other capabilities such as experience and agency. This research is noteworthy for elucidating the variances in preferences for human and AI agents across medical and financial services and the rationale behind these differences. It enhances our theoretical comprehension of the pivotal factors influencing preferences for human and AI agents, underscoring the significance of human experiential capabilities like empathy.",,第1页.xls
362,Interacting with Healthcare Chatbot: Effects of Status Cues and Message Contingency on AI Credibility Assessment,2024,"How do status cues of AI agents alter human users' interpretations and evaluations of these agents during human-AI interactions? Drawing upon social status theories and the CASA paradigm, this study explores the influences of status cues in AI-powered healthcare chatbots on AI credibility assessment via perceived AI agency and AI anxiety. The moderation effects of message contingency are also examined. A 2 (status cues: high-status vs. low-status) x 2 (message contingency: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment was conducted online (N = 209). Results revealed that healthcare chatbots with high-status (vs. low-status) cues were perceived as having more AI agency, which was further associated with higher perceived AI credibility. Perceived AI agency and AI anxiety sequentially mediated the effect of social status cues on perceived AI credibility. Results also showed that high (vs. low) message contingency significantly ameliorated users' AI anxiety for high-status healthcare chatbots. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",,第1页.xls
363,Challenges and efforts in managing AI trustworthiness risks: a state of knowledge.,2024,"This paper addresses the critical gaps in existing AI risk management frameworks, emphasizing the neglect of human factors and the absence of metrics for socially related or human threats. Drawing from insights provided by NIST AI RFM and ENISA, the research underscores the need for understanding the limitations of human-AI interaction and the development of ethical and social measurements.

It delves into technical threats and vulnerabilities, including data access, poisoning, and backdoors, highlighting the importance of collaboration between cybersecurity engineers, AI experts, and social-psychology-behavior-ethics professionals. Furthermore, the socio-psychological threats associated with AI integration into society are examined, addressing issues such as bias, misinformation, and privacy erosion. The manuscript proposes a comprehensive approach to AI trustworthiness, combining technical and social mitigation measures, standards, and ongoing research initiatives. Additionally, it introduces innovative defense strategies, such as cyber-social exercises, digital clones, and conversational agents, to enhance understanding of adversary profiles and fortify AI security. The paper concludes with a call for interdisciplinary collaboration, awareness campaigns, and continuous research efforts to create a robust and resilient AI ecosystem aligned with ethical standards and societal expectations.",,第1页.xls
364,Collaborative Learning with Artificial Intelligence Speakers (CLAIS): Pre-Service Elementary Science Teachers' Responses to the Prototype [arXiv],2024,"This research aims to demonstrate that AI can function not only as a tool for learning, but also as an intelligent agent with which humans can engage in collaborative learning (CL) to change epistemic practices in science classrooms. We adopted a design and development research approach, following the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation (ADDIE) model, to prototype a tangible instructional system called Collaborative Learning with AI Speakers (CLAIS). The CLAIS system is designed to have 3-4 human learners join an AI speaker to form a small group, where humans and AI are considered as peers participating in the Jigsaw learning process. The development was carried out using the NUGU AI speaker platform. The CLAIS system was successfully implemented in a Science Education course session with 15 pre-service elementary science teachers. The participants evaluated the CLAIS system through mixed methods surveys as teachers, learners, peers, and users. Quantitative data showed that the participants' Intelligent-Technological, Pedagogical, And Content Knowledge was significantly increased after the CLAIS session, the perception of the CLAIS learning experience was positive, the peer assessment on AI speakers and human peers was different, and the user experience was ambivalent. Qualitative data showed that the participants anticipated future changes in the epistemic process in science classrooms, while acknowledging technical issues such as speech recognition performance and response latency. This study highlights the potential of Human-AI Collaboration for knowledge co-construction in authentic classroom settings and exemplify how AI could shape the future landscape of epistemic practices in the classroom.",,第1页.xls
365,Is Gender-Neutral AI the Correct Solution to Gender Bias? Using Speech-Based Conversational Agents,2023,"Background There is an issue that AI agents learn many human behaviors and values, and among them, they also learn the bias of human society. Gender bias, a significant global problem, has penetrated the domain of artificial intelligence (AI). Since AI agents are human digital assistants, it is possible to confirm gender bias in considering several AI agents, such as speech-based conversational agents, as “female.” While gender-neutral AI agents are considered the only solution, there are concerns that they could backfire on human-AI interactions. Therefore, we investigated whether interactions with gender- neutral agents are effective when compared to the expectant gender (the gender that users expect) from AI agents.Methods We selected a “speech-based conversational agent” as a research tool that allows users to use it closely in their daily lives and intuitively judge gender. We conducted two study courses. First, we investigate the current gender status of AI agents (speech-based conversational agents). Participants who closely used gender-biased agents confirmed which voice tone and color gender they were expecting.Moreover, we checked what gender the participants expected for each task and performance experience.Second, we tested the usability of agents to which gender-neutral voices were applied. We checked how participants evaluate agents with four versions of neutral voices in terms of preference, stability, and satisfaction.Results The first study confirmed that users perceived speech-based conversational agents as roles to perform simple tasks such as music or weather information retrieval. Moreover, participants consistently expected that a “female” would perform this role well on the side of task and experiences of task performance. The second study confirmed that participants do not prefer the gender-neutral voice of “G” because their identity is challenging to grasp. In addition, participants evaluated that some versions of “G” did not show human-like features. Thus, they did not feel stable. Finally, participants did not feel sufficient satisfaction because they did not prefer all versions of “G” and felt stable in some versions of “G.” Therefore, the participants underestimated the usability of the speech-based conversational gender- neutral agent.Conclusions This research shows a great possibility that ignoring the expectant gender and applying gender-neutral will hinder the usability of AI agents. In addition, gender-neutral can instead be a trigger that reminds the user of the expectant gender. Therefore, we suggest that it should not be divided into human gender concepts but rather move toward genderless design that encompasses diversity.",,第1页.xls
366,Adaptive trust calibration for human-AI collaboration,2020,"Safety and efficiency of human-AI collaboration often depend on how humans could appropriately calibrate their trust towards the AI agents. Over-trusting the autonomous system sometimes causes serious safety issues. Although many studies focused on the importance of system transparency in keeping proper trust calibration, the research in detecting and mitigating improper trust calibration remains very limited. To fill these research gaps, we propose a method of adaptive trust calibration that consists of a framework for detecting the inappropriate calibration status by monitoring the user's reliance behavior and cognitive cues called trust calibration cues to prompt the user to reinitiate trust calibration. We evaluated our framework and four types of trust calibration cues in an online experiment using a drone simulator. A total of 116 participants performed pothole inspection tasks by using the drone's automatic inspection, the reliability of which could fluctuate depending upon the weather conditions. The participants needed to decide whether to rely on automatic inspection or to do the inspection manually. The results showed that adaptively presenting simple cues could significantly promote trust calibration during over-trust.",,第1页.xls

368,Teach AI How to Code: Using Large Language Models as Teachable Agents for Programming Education,2024,"This work investigates large language models (LLMs) as teachable agents for learning by teaching (LBT). LBT with teachable agents helps learners identify knowledge gaps and discover new knowledge. However, teachable agents require expensive programming of subject-specific knowledge. While LLMs as teachable agents can reduce the cost, LLMs' expansive knowledge as tutees discourages learners from teaching. We propose a prompting pipeline that restrains LLMs' knowledge and makes them initiate why and how questions for effective knowledge-building. We combined these techniques into TeachYou, an LBT environment for algorithm learning, and AlgoBo, an LLM-based tutee chatbot that can simulate misconceptions and unawareness prescribed in its knowledge state. Our technical evaluation confirmed that our prompting pipeline can effectively configure AlgoBo's problem-solving performance. Through a between-subject study with 40 algorithm novices, we also observed that AlgoBo's questions led to knowledge-dense conversations (effect size=0.71). Lastly, we discuss design implications, cost-efficiency, and personalization of LLM-based teachable agents.",,第1页.xls
369,Evaluating Knowledge Graphs with Hybrid Intelligence,2023,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) enable the conceptualization of knowledge about the world in a machine-readable format and serve as a foundation to many advanced intelligent applications, such as conversational agents. Ensuring the correctness and quality of KGs is essential for the prevention of invalid application outputs and biased systems, which can result from incorrectly or incompletely represented information. While certain KG quality issues can be automatically detected, others require human involvement, including the identification of incorrectly modeled statements or the discovery of concepts not compliant with how humans think. Human computation and crowdsourcing (HC &C) techniques have been used as a promising method for outsourcing human-centric tasks to human contributors at a reduced cost. Nevertheless, there is no clear guideline on how human-centric KG evaluations should be prepared and scalable evaluation of large KGs utilizing HC &C techniques alone remains a challenge. In this thesis, we investigate a human-centric KG evaluation approach, relying on hybrid (human-AI) intelligence, which leverages techniques from the semantic web, HC &C and multi-agent systems communities for ensuring an efficiently planned, scalable, well-coordinated, and thus transparent KG evaluation process.",,第1页.xls
370,Cooperative Bayesian Optimization for Imperfect Agents,2023,"We introduce a cooperative Bayesian optimization problem for optimizing black-box functions of two variables where two agents choose together at which points to query the function but have only control over one variable each. This setting is inspired by human-AI teamwork, where an AI-assistant helps its human user solve a problem, in this simplest case, collaborative optimization. We formulate the solution as sequential decision-making, where the agent we control models the user as a computationally rational agent with prior knowledge about the function. We show that strategic planning of the queries enables better identification of the global maximum of the function as long as the user avoids excessive exploration. This planning is made possible by using Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo planning and by endowing the agent with a user model that accounts for conservative belief updates and exploratory sampling of the points to query.",,第1页.xls

To better understand how access to conversational AI affects productivity and trust, we conducted a mixed-methods, task-based user study, observing 76 software engineers (N=76) as they completed a programming exam with and without access to Bard. Effects on performance, efficiency, satisfaction, and trust vary depending on user expertise, question type (open-ended solve questions vs. definitive search questions), and measurement type (demonstrated vs. self-reported). Our findings include evidence of automation complacency, increased reliance on the AI over the course of the task, and increased performance for novices on solve-type questions when using the AI. We discuss common behaviors, design recommendations, and impact considerations to improve collaborations with conversational AI.",,第1页.xls

374,Drawing with Reframer: Emergence and Control in Co-Creative AI,2023,"Over the past few years, rapid developments in AI have resulted in new models capable of generating high-quality images and creative artefacts, most of which seek to fully automate the process of creation. In stark contrast, creative professionals rely on iteration-to change their mind, to modify their sketches, and to re-imagine. For that reason, end-to-end generative approaches limit application to real-world design workflows. We present a novel human-AI drawing interface called Reframer, along with a new survey instrument for evaluating co-creative systems. Based on a co-creative drawing model called the Collaborative, Interactive Context-Aware Design Agent (CICADA), Reframer uses CLIP-guided synthesisby-optimisation to support real-time synchronous drawing with AI. We present two versions of Reframer's interface, one that prioritises emergence and system agency and the other control and user agency. To begin exploring how these different interaction models might influence the user experience, we also propose the Mixed-Initiative Creativity Support Index (MICSI). MICSI rates co-creative systems along experiential axes relevant to AI co-creation. We administer MICSI and a short qualitative interview to users who engaged with the Reframer variants on two distinct creative tasks. The results show overall broad efficacy of Reframer as a creativity support tool, but MICSI also allows us to begin unpacking the complex interactions between learning effects, task type, visibility, control, and emergent behaviour. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings highlight challenges for future co-creative systems design.",,第1页.xls
375,AlignDiff: Aligning Diverse Human Preferences via Behavior-Customisable Diffusion Model [arXiv],2023,"Aligning agent behaviors with diverse human preferences remains a challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL), owing to the inherent abstractness and mutability of human preferences. To address these issues, we propose AlignDiff, a novel framework that leverages RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) to quantify human preferences, covering abstractness, and utilizes them to guide diffusion planning for zero-shot behavior customizing, covering mutability. AlignDiff can accurately match user-customized behaviors and efficiently switch from one to another. To build the framework, we first establish the multi-perspective human feedback datasets, which contain comparisons for the attributes of diverse behaviors, and then train an attribute strength model to predict quantified relative strengths. After relabeling behavioral datasets with relative strengths, we proceed to train an attribute-conditioned diffusion model, which serves as a planner with the attribute strength model as a director for preference aligning at the inference phase. We evaluate AlignDiff on various locomotion tasks and demonstrate its superior performance on preference matching, switching, and covering compared to other baselines. Its capability of completing unseen downstream tasks under human instructions also showcases the promising potential for human-AI collaboration.

376,Great Chain of Agents: The Role of Metaphorical Representation of Agents in Conversational Crowdsourcing,2022,"Conversational agents are being widely adopted across several domains to serve a variety of purposes ranging from providing intelligent assistance to companionship. Recent literature has shown that users develop intuitive folk theories and a metaphorical understanding of conversational agents (CAs) due to the lack of a mental model of the agents. However, investigation of metaphorical agent representation in the HCI community has mainly focused on the human level, despite non-human metaphors for agents being prevalent in the real world. We adopted Lakoff and Turner's 'Great Chain of Being' framework to systematically investigate the impact of using non-human metaphors to represent conversational agents on worker engagement in crowdsourcing marketplaces. We designed a text-based conversational agent that assists crowd workers in task execution. Through a between-subjects experimental study (N = 341), we explored how different human and non-human metaphors affect worker engagement, the perceived cognitive load of workers, intrinsic motivation, and their trust in the agents. Our findings bridge the gap of how users experience CAs with non-human metaphors in the context of conversational crowdsourcing.",,第1页.xls

378,Demo: Combining Implicit Gaze and AI for Real-Time Intention Projection,2019,"Intention recognition is the process of using behavioural cues to infer an agent's goals or future behaviour. In face-to-face communication, our gaze implicitly signals our point of interest within the environment and therefore, inadvertently leaks our unspoken intentions to others. In our published body of work, we leverage this implicit function of gaze together with the tendency of humans to plan before executing their actions, resulting in an artificial agent that can project humans intentions while human players engage in a competitive game. In this demo, we created a path-planning game to demonstrate the capability of our artificial agent in a playful manner. The agent projects future plans of players by combining the use of implicit gaze of human players with an AI planning-based model. The demo aims to illustrate that gaze is intentional and that socially interactive agents can harness gaze as a natural input implicitly to assist humans collaboratively with knowledge of their intentions.",,第1页.xls

380,Towards a Unifying Model of Rationality in Multiagent Systems [arXiv],2023,"Multiagent systems deployed in the real world need to cooperate with other agents (including humans) nearly as effectively as these agents cooperate with one another. To design such AI, and provide guarantees of its effectiveness, we need to clearly specify what types of agents our AI must be able to cooperate with. In this work we propose a generic model of socially intelligent agents, which are individually rational learners that are also able to cooperate with one another (in the sense that their joint behavior is Pareto efficient). We define rationality in terms of the regret incurred by each agent over its lifetime, and show how we can construct socially intelligent agents for different forms of regret. We then discuss the implications of this model for the development of robust MAS that can cooperate with a wide variety of socially intelligent agents.",,第1页.xls
381,Human-level design proposals by an artificial agent in multiple scenarios,2021,"Many computational tools are usually trained using human-curated data set of design proposals. However, this approach can limit system capabilities to generate creative designs since human knowledge of the solution space is already embedded in the training process. In this paper, we show how by using a flexible design tool that can also be used by humans, an artificial agent can learn to generate creative designs with any prior knowledge of the solution space. Our results show how our agent is able to create human-level design proposals in terms of performance and novelty. Based on these results, we discuss the importance of defining a shared design language and tools in order to support human-AI collaboration in creative scenarios. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

382,Conversational Crowdsensing: A Parallel Intelligence Powered Novel Sensing Approach [arXiv],2024,"The transition from CPS-based Industry 4.0 to CPSS-based Industry 5.0 brings new requirements and opportunities to current sensing approaches, especially in light of recent progress in Chatbots and Large Language Models (LLMs). Therefore, the advancement of parallel intelligence-powered Crowdsensing Intelligence (CSI) is witnessed, which is currently advancing towards linguistic intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel sensing paradigm, namely conversational crowdsensing, for Industry 5.0. It can alleviate workload and professional requirements of individuals and promote the organization and operation of diverse workforce, thereby facilitating faster response and wider popularization of crowdsensing systems. Specifically, we design the architecture of conversational crowdsensing to effectively organize three types of participants (biological, robotic, and digital) from diverse communities. Through three levels of effective conversation (i.e., inter-human, human-AI, and inter-AI), complex interactions and service functionalities of different workers can be achieved to accomplish various tasks across three sensing phases (i.e., requesting, scheduling, and executing). Moreover, we explore the foundational technologies for realizing conversational crowdsensing, encompassing LLM-based multi-agent systems, scenarios engineering and conversational human-AI cooperation. Finally, we present potential industrial applications of conversational crowdsensing and discuss its implications. We envision that conversations in natural language will become the primary communication channel during crowdsensing process, enabling richer information exchange and cooperative problem-solving among humans, robots, and AI.",,第1页.xls
383,Exploring the Impact of Explainability on Trust and Acceptance of Conversational Agents - A Wizard of Oz Study,2024,"With advancements in natural language processing and understanding, conversational agents (CAs) have become one of the fundamental modes of human-computer interaction. However, the black-box problem of AI algorithms often results in reduced acceptance of such systems. This calls for transparency and justification or rationale for the provided output from the users' perspective. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) provides insights into the algorithms and elucidates outputs to the users, thus gaining more importance in various applications as a significant contributor to user acceptance and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This paper presents aWizard of Oz user study with a between-subjects design comparing two versions of a vacation planning chatbot (low and high explainability) with 60 participants. The study explored the impact of explainability on users' understanding, trust and acceptance. The results indicated that explanations (between-subject factor) significantly influence users' understanding, trust and acceptance. According to our results, high explainability leads to increased trust and acceptance of the chatbot.",,第1页.xls
384,Better Understanding of Humans for Cooperative AI through Clustering,2024,"Cooperative AI and AI alignment research are increasingly important fields of study as machine learning models are becoming more prevalent in society. Applications such as self-driving cars, realistic AI in games, and human-AI teams, all require further advancement in cooperative and alignment research before more widespread applications can be achieved. However, research in these fields has typically lagged behind other machine learning applications due to the difficulty of creating models that are robust to and can adapt to novel human partners. We attempt to address this through the creation of a framework that uses Archetypal Analysis, a unique clustering algorithm that finds extremal 'archetype' points in a dataset and expresses each other point as a convex combination of these archetypes. This framework creates understandable archetypes of players which a reinforcement learning agent can use to adapt accordingly to unseen partners. We show that this framework not only results in performance comparable to other cooperative benchmark models but also achieves higher levels of perceived cooperativeness without the need for human involvement during the training process. As such, we demonstrate that the use of clustering techniques to better model different types of human behaviour and strategies can be an effective approach in improving the ability of AI models to adapt to and improve cooperation with novel partners.",,第1页.xls
385,Designing for Human-Agent Alignment: Understanding what humans want from their agents,2024,"Our ability to build autonomous agents that leverage Generative AI continues to increase by the day. As builders and users of such agents it is unclear what parameters we need to align on before the agents start performing tasks on our behalf. To discover these parameters, we ran a qualitative empirical research study about designing agents that can negotiate during a fictional yet relatable task of selling a camera online. We found that for an agent to perform the task successfully, humans/users and agents need to align over 6 dimensions: 1) Knowledge Schema Alignment 2) Autonomy and Agency Alignment 3) Operational Alignment and Training 4) Reputational Heuristics Alignment 5) Ethics Alignment and 6) Human Engagement Alignment. These empirical findings expand previous work related to process and specification alignment and the need for values and safety in Human-AI interactions. Subsequently we discuss three design directions for designers who are imagining a world filled with Human-Agent collaborations.",,第1页.xls
386,Designing Interactions with Intention-Aware Gaze-Enabled Artificial Agents,2019,"As it becomes more common for humans to work alongside artificial agents on everyday tasks, it is increasingly important to design artificial agents that can understand and interact with their human counterparts naturally. We posit that an effective way to do this is to harness nonverbal cues used in human-human interaction. We, therefore, leverage knowledge from existing work on gaze-based intention recognition, where the awareness of gaze can provide insights into the future actions of an observed human subject. In this paper, we design and evaluate the use of a proactive intention-aware gaze-enabled artificial agent that assists a human player engaged in an online strategy game. The agent assists by recognising and communicating the intentions of a human opponent in real-time, potentially improving situation awareness. Our first study identifies the language requirements for the artificial agent to communicate the opponent's intentions to the assisted player, using an inverted Wizard of Oz method approach. Our second study compares the experience of playing an online strategy game with and without the assistance of the agent. Specifically, we conducted a within-subjects study with 30 participants to compare their experience of playing with (1) detailed AI predictions, (2) abstract AI predictions, and (3) no AI predictions but with a live visualisation of their opponent's gaze. Our results show that the agent can facilitate awareness of another user's intentions without adding visual distraction to the interface; however, the cognitive workload was similar across all three conditions, suggesting that the manner in which the agent communicates its predictions requires further exploration. Overall, our work contributes to the understanding of how to support human-agent teams in a dynamic collaboration scenario. We provide a positive account of humans interacting with an intention-aware artificial agent afforded by gaze input, which presents immediate opportunities for improving interactions between the counterparts.",,第1页.xls

We introduce 'ORIBA', a customizable AI chatbot that enables illustrators to converse with their OCs. This approach allows artists to not only receive responses from their OCs but also to observe their inner monologues and behavior. Despite the existing tension between artists and AI, our study explores innovative collaboration methods that are inspiring to illustrators.

Rather than assuming trust based on past system behaviours, it is important to formally verify trust by modelling the current state and capabilities of agents. We argue for verifying actual trust relations based on agents abilities to deliver intended outcomes in specific contexts. To enable reasoning about different notions of trust, we propose using the refinement-based formal method Event-B. Refinement allows progressively introducing new aspects of trust from abstract to concrete models incorporating knowledge and runtime states. We demonstrate modelling three trust concepts and verifying associated trust properties in MAS. The formal, correctness-by-construction approach allows to deduce guarantees about trustworthy autonomy in human-AI partnerships. Overall, our contribution facilitates rigorous verification of trust in multiagent systems.",,第1页.xls

390,"Modeling, Replicating, and Predicting Human Behavior: A Survey",2023,"Given the popular presupposition of human reasoning as the standard for learning and decision making, there have been significant efforts and a growing trend in research to replicate these innate human abilities in artificial systems. As such, topics including Game Theory, Theory of Mind, and Machine Learning, among others, integrate concepts that are assumed components of human reasoning. These serve as techniques to replicate and understand the behaviors of humans. In addition, next-generation autonomous and adaptive systems will largely include AI agents and humans working together as teams. To make this possible, autonomous agents will require the ability to embed practical models of human behavior, allowing them not only to replicate human models as a technique to learn but also to understand the actions of users and anticipate their behavior, so as to truly operate in symbiosis with them. The main objective of this article is to provide a succinct yet systematic review of important approaches in two areas dealing with quantitative models of human behaviors. Specifically, we focus on (i) techniques that learn a model or policy of behavior through exploration and feedback, such as Reinforcement Learning, and (ii) directly model mechanisms of human reasoning, such as beliefs and bias, without necessarily learning via trial and error.",,第1页.xls

In this work, we explore the potential for significantly increased UAV efficiency, versatility, and durability with AI-based control techniques. The research technique combines simulation, experimental validation, and mathematical modelling to fully investigate AI-based control systems. We develop a mathematical model of UAV dynamics and use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique based on Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) to control the drones. Both theoretical analysis and real-world testing on a DJI Matrice 210 RTK platform validate the method's efficacy. The algorithm's capacity to provide precise and accurate answers is shown by the average location error's steady decline over time. It is very resilient, remaining stable in the face of wind gusts, and remarkably flexible, with quick response times. These patterns are shown graphically. According to the study's findings, AI-based control algorithms might greatly advance UAV technology by increasing its precision, adaptability, and dependability. Future priorities will include advanced machine learning techniques, multi-agent systems, safety measures, ethical frameworks, human-AI collaboration, environmental impact assessments, and urban integration. Through the creation of new capabilities and the resolution of urgent concerns, these activities have significant potential to impact UAV development in the future.",,第1页.xls
393,K-level Reasoning for Zero-Shot Coordination in Hanabi,2021,"The standard problem setting in cooperative multi-agent settings is self-play (SP), where the goal is to train a team of agents that works well together. However, optimal SP policies commonly contain arbitrary conventions (handshakes) and are not compatible with other, independently trained agents or humans. This latter desiderata was recently formalized by [18] as the zero-shot coordination (ZSC) setting and partially addressed with their Other-Play (OP) algorithm, which showed improved ZSC and human-AI performance in the card game Hanabi. OP assumes access to the symmetries of the environment and prevents agents from breaking these in a mutually incompatible way during training. However, as the authors point out, discovering symmetries for a given environment is a computationally hard problem. Instead, we show that through a simple adaption of k-level reasoning (KLR) [7], synchronously training all levels, we can obtain competitive ZSC and ad-hoc teamplay performance in Hanabi, including when paired with a humanlike proxy bot. We also introduce a new method, synchronous-k-level reasoning with a best response (SyKLRBR), which further improves performance on our synchronous KLR by co-training a best response.",,第1页.xls
394,Towards Collaborative Plan Acquisition through Theory of Mind Modeling in Situated Dialogue,2023,"Collaborative tasks often begin with partial task knowledge and incomplete initial plans from each partner. To complete these tasks, agents need to engage in situated communication with their partners and coordinate their partial plans towards a complete plan to achieve a joint task goal. While such collaboration seems effortless in a human-human team, it is highly challenging for human-AI collaboration. To address this limitation, this paper takes a step towards collaborative plan acquisition, where humans and agents strive to learn and communicate with each other to acquire a complete plan for joint tasks. Specifically, we formulate a novel problem for agents to predict the missing task knowledge for themselves and for their partners based on rich perceptual and dialogue history. We extend a situated dialogue benchmark for symmetric collaborative tasks in a 3D blocks world and investigate computational strategies for plan acquisition. Our empirical results suggest that predicting the partner's missing knowledge is a more viable approach than predicting one's own. We show that explicit modeling of the partner's dialogue moves and mental states produces improved and more stable results than without. These results provide insight for future AI agents that can predict what knowledge their partner is missing and, therefore, can proactively communicate such information to help their partner acquire such missing knowledge toward a common understanding of joint tasks.",,第1页.xls
395,Systematic review and meta-analysis of AI-based conversational agents for promoting mental health and well-being,2023,"Conversational artificial intelligence (AI), particularly AI-based conversational agents (CAs), is gaining traction in mental health care. Despite their growing usage, there is a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of their impact on mental health and well-being. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to fill this gap by synthesizing evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based CAs in improving mental health and factors influencing their effectiveness and user experience. Twelve databases were searched for experimental studies of AI-based CAs' effects on mental illnesses and psychological well-being published before May 26, 2023. Out of 7834 records, 35 eligible studies were identified for systematic review, out of which 15 randomized controlled trials were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that AI-based CAs significantly reduce symptoms of depression (Hedge's g 0.64 [95% CI 0.17-1.12]) and distress (Hedge's g 0.7 [95% CI 0.18-1.22]). These effects were more pronounced in CAs that are multimodal, generative AI-based, integrated with mobile/instant messaging apps, and targeting clinical/subclinical and elderly populations. However, CA-based interventions showed no significant improvement in overall psychological well-being (Hedge's g 0.32 [95% CI -0.13 to 0.78]). User experience with AI-based CAs was largely shaped by the quality of human-AI therapeutic relationships, content engagement, and effective communication. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based CAs in addressing mental health issues. Future research should investigate the underlying mechanisms of their effectiveness, assess long-term effects across various mental health outcomes, and evaluate the safe integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care.",,第1页.xls
396,Legible Normativity for AI Alignment: The Value of Silly Rules,2019,"It has become commonplace to assert that autonomous agents will have to be built to follow human rules of behavior-social norms and laws. But human laws and norms are complex and culturally varied systems; in many cases agents will have to learn the rules. This requires autonomous agents to have models of how human rule systems work so that they can make reliable predictions about rules. In this paper we contribute to the building of such models by analyzing an overlooked distinction between important rules and what we call silly rules rules with no discernible direct impact on welfare. We show that silly rules render a normative system both more robust and more adaptable in response to shocks to perceived stability. They make normativity more legible for humans, and can increase legibility for AI systems as well. For AI systems to integrate into human normative systems, we suggest, it may be important for them to have models that include representations of silly rules.",,第1页.xls
397,Ask DoctorBot: Unpacking the Social Design Aspects of Symptom Assessment Chatbots,2024,"Conversational AI applications or chatbots have raised fundamental questions on understanding emerging user experiences. Healthcare chatbots offer omnipresent and responsive support for symptom checking by acting as virtual health assistants. The research focuses on the social design aspects of symptom assessment chatbots - in particular - emotional support and automated social presence. A survey study with 223 users of a symptom assessment chatbot in China supports the significant impact of these two design elements on perceptions of functional service quality. However, the same effect was not found for service satisfaction, suggesting a disconnection between interaction elements and expectations about what symptom assessment chatbots can achieve for users. Reflecting on the results, the research identifies the influence mechanisms of healthcare chatbots' social design on the processes and outcomes of user engagement.",,第1页.xls
398,Augmenting Human Cognition with an AI-Mediated Intelligent Visual Feedback,2023,"In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this trade-of problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user performance, in comparison to the baseline group.",,第1页.xls
399,Anthropomorphic response: Understanding interactions between humans and artificial intelligence agents,2023,"This study ofanthropomorphic responseto artificial intelligence begins with an extensive review of the literature and an identification of conceptual distinctions betweenanthropomorphismandanthropomorphic response.The authors develop an instrument for measuring how users formanthropomorphic responseto interactions with AI chatbots. Amazon MTurk is used to recruit 120 users for a pilot study and 303 users for the main study. Participants respond to six scenarios depicting interactions with banking service chatbots of varying appearance and intelligence. Results show that anthropomorphic response depend on perceptions of agent appearance, cognitive intelligence, and emotional intelligence. Users perceive more humanness in highly intelligent but disembodied agents rather than in highly intelligent agents that have poorly designed appearances. And users who have strong tendencies to anthropomorphize non-sentient entities are less likely to form anthropomorphic response when interacting with agents with high cognitive intelligence. The study enhances understandings about human/AI interactions. It provides directions for future research regarding anthropomorphic response and provide directions for future research on designing and using artificial agents.

401,Optimizing Conversational Commerce Involving Multilingual Consumers Through Large Language Models' Natural Language Understanding Abilities,2024,"Due to the emergence of natural language processing (NLP) interfaces, there has been growing intent to use conversational channels for commerce. Beyond customer service, NLP-enabled AI agents are being integrated into various steps of the order-to-cash (OTC) process. Social media and messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger have become pivotal for businesses, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but adoption has been limited. In addition, attitudes towards fully-automated conversational agents (CA) have been mixed, and there is room for human involvement in transactional conversations. A distinguishing contribution of this research is leveraging the inherent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling multilingual conversations and extracting transactional details through named entity recognition (NER). The study describes a hybrid human-AI setup augmenting agents with an auto-agent leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities, designed using the OTC process pattern applied to conversational UX frameworks. A prototype of the setup aims to streamline operations and reduce errors by enhancing the user experience during key OTC steps through improved conversational design. Recognizing the irreplaceable essence of human interaction, the hybrid human-in-the-loop approach was chosen, mitigating the impersonal nature of full automation. A prototype handling customers and humans augmented by LLMs for NER handling of transaction, customer, and product information was built. Sample synthetic bilingual conversations between customers and sales agents were generated using ChatGPT and fed into the system for evaluation.",,第1页.xls
402,Memory Sandbox: Transparent and Interactive Memory Management for Conversational Agents,2023,"The recent advent of large language models (LLM) has resulted in high-performing conversational agents such as ChatGPT. These agents must remember key information from an ongoing conversation to provide responses that are contextually relevant to the user. However, these agents have limited memory and can be distracted by irrelevant parts of the conversation. While many strategies exist to manage conversational memory, users currently lack affordances for viewing and controlling what the agent remembers, resulting in a poor mental model and conversational breakdowns. In this paper, we present Memory Sandbox, an interactive system and design probe that allows users to manage the conversational memory of LLM-powered agents. By treating memories as data objects that can be viewed, manipulated, recorded, summarized, and shared across conversations, Memory Sandbox provides interaction affordances for users to manage how the agent should 'see' the conversation.",,第1页.xls
403,AI Health Counselor's Self-Disclosure: Its Impact on User Responses Based on Individual and Cultural Variation,2024,"This research extends the literature by showing that the positive effects of self-disclosure by an AI voice bot (AVB) vary depending on the identity perception of the bot (human or machine) and the cultural characteristics of the users: when an AVB is perceived as human and engages in personal self-disclosure, users feel more intimate with and trust the bot, and when the bot is perceived as machine and engages in factual self-disclosure, users feel more intimate with and trust the AVB. We also found that South Korean (vs. U.S.) users felt more intimate with and trusted AVBs when they perceived the bot as human and when it engaged in personal self-disclosure. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.",,第1页.xls
404,"Should I Follow the Human, or Follow the Robot? - Robots in Power Can Have More Influence Than Humans on Decision-Making",2023,"Artificially intelligent (AI) agents such as robots are increasingly delegated power in work settings, yet it remains unclear how power functions in interactions with both humans and robots, especially when they directly compete for influence. Here we present an experiment where every participant was matched with one human and one robot to perform decision-making tasks. By manipulating who has power, we created three conditions: human as leader, robot as leader, and a no-power-difference control. The results showed that the participants were significantly more influenced by the leader, regardless of whether the leader was a human or a robot. However, they generally held a more positive attitude toward the human than the robot, although they considered whichever was in power as more competent. This study illustrates the importance of power for future Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human-AI Interaction (HAI) research, as it addresses pressing concerns of society about AI-powered intelligent agents.",,第1页.xls
405,Trusting Your AI Agent Emotionally and Cognitively: Development and Validation of a Semantic Differential Scale for AI Trust,2024,"Trust is not just a cognitive issue but also an emotional one, yet the research in human-AI interactions has primarily focused on the cognitive route of trust development. Recent work has highlighted the importance of studying affective trust towards AI, especially in the context of emerging human-like LLMs-powered conversational agents. However, there is a lack of validated and generalizable measures for the two-dimensional construct of trust in AI agents. To address this gap, we developed and validated a set of 27-item semantic differential scales for affective and cognitive trust through a scenario-based survey study. We then further validated and applied the scale through an experiment study. Our empirical findings showed how the emotional and cognitive aspects of trust interact with each other and collectively shape a person's overall trust in AI agents. Our study methodology and findings also provide insights into the capability of the state-of-art LLMs to foster trust through different routes.",,第1页.xls
406,A new Workflow for Human-AI Collaboration in Citizen Science,2022,"The unprecedented growth of online citizen science projects provides growing opportunities for the public to participate in scientific discoveries. Nevertheless, volunteers typically make only a few contributions before exiting the system. Thus a significant challenge to such systems is increasing the capacity and efficiency of volunteers without hindering their motivation and engagement. To address this challenge, we study the role of incorporating collaborative agents in the existing workflow of a citizen science project for the purpose of increasing the capacity and efficiency of these systems, while maintaining the motivation of participants in the system. Our new enhanced workflow combines human-machine collaboration in two ways: Humans can aid the machine in solving more difficult tasks with high information value, while the machine can facilitate human engagement by generating motivational messages that emphasize different aspects of human-machine collaboration. We implemented this workflow in a study comprising thousands of volunteers in Galaxy Zoo, one of the largest citizen science projects on the web. Volunteers could choose to use the enhanced workflow or the existing workflow in which users did not receive motivational messages, and tasks were allocated to volunteers sequentially without regard to information value. We found that the volunteers working in the enhanced workflow were more productive than those volunteers who worked in the existing workflow, without incurring a loss in the quality of their contributions. Additionally, in the enhanced workflow, the type of messages used had a profound effect on volunteer performance. Our work demonstrates the importance of varying human-machine collaboration models in citizen science.",,第1页.xls
407,Dancing with the Unexpected and Beyond,2022,"The creation process of design fiction is going participatory and inclusive with non-experts. Recognizing the potential of artificial intelligence in creativity support, we explore the use of AI assistance in creating design fiction. This investigation is based on a workshop on 'future work in 2040' with Chinese youth (N=20). We look into fiction quality, participants' experiences with the AI agent, and their ways of incorporating those texts into writing. Our findings show that human writers while responding to messy and unexpected AIgenerated texts, can elevate the richness and creativity in writing and initiate joyful and inspirational interactions. Furthermore, for the design of AI assistance in creativity support, we suggest two implications of enhancing interactional quality between human and AI and prompt programming. Our study indicates the potential of applying design fiction outside the design context using a more inclusive approach for future speculation with critical reflection on technology.",,第1页.xls
408,Empirical evidence and computational assessment on design knowledge transferability,2024,"Developing an artificial design agent that mimics human design behaviors through the integration of heuristics is pivotal for various purposes, including advancing design automation, fostering human-AI collaboration, and enhancing design education. However, this endeavor necessitates abundant behavioral data from human designers, posing a challenge due to data scarcity for many design problems. One potential solution lies in transferring learned design knowledge from one problem domain to another. This article aims to gather empirical evidence and computationally evaluate the transferability of design knowledge represented at a high level of abstraction across different design problems. Initially, a design agent grounded in reinforcement learning (RL) is developed to emulate human design behaviors. A data-driven reward mechanism, informed by the Markov chain model, is introduced to reinforce prominent sequential design patterns. Subsequently, the design agent transfers the acquired knowledge from a source task to a target task using a problem-agnostic high-level representation. Through a case study involving two solar system designs, one dataset trains the design agent to mimic human behaviors, while another evaluates the transferability of these learned behaviors to a distinct problem. Results demonstrate that the RL-based agent outperforms a baseline model utilizing the first-order Markov chain model in both the source task without knowledge transfer and the target task with knowledge transfer. However, the model's performance is comparatively lower in predicting the decisions of low-performing designers, suggesting caution in its application, as it may yield unsatisfactory results when mimicking such behaviors.",,第1页.xls
409,"The computer, A choreographer? Aesthetic responses to randomly-generated dance choreography by a computer",2023,"Is artificial intelligence (AI) changing our culture or creating its own? With advancements in AI and machine learning, artistic creativity is moving to a brave new world of possibility and complexity, while at the same time posing challenging questions, such as what defines something as art, what is the role of human creativity in an automated world, and do we evaluate artificial art in the same way as art made by humans? Across two pre-registered and statistically powered experiments we shed light on the nature of aesthetic responses toward computer-generated art by investi-gating observer prejudices against computer-generated dance choreography, and the impact of expertise and pre-conceived beliefs about the origin of artistic creation. Our results provide substantive evidence that an explicit bias exists among dance experts against computer-generated chore-ography. The mere belief about a dance work's origin biases aesthetic responses toward artworks among both dance experts and dance naive participants. The implications of the current study serve to inform several disciplines across the arts and sciences including but not limited to empirical aesthetics, artificial intelligence, engineering, robotics, and social cognition and neuroscience. Along with physical form and content of artificial agents and art productions, the viewers' knowledge and attitudes toward artistic AI and artificial agents will need to be taken into consideration for effective human-computer/human-AI interactions.",,第1页.xls
410,Bias Mitigation via Compensation: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective,2024,"As AI increasingly integrates with human decision-making, we must carefully consider interactions between the two. In particular, current approaches focus on optimizing individual agent actions but often overlook the nuances of collective intelligence. Group dynamics might require that one agent (e.g., the AI system) compensate for biases and errors in another agent (e.g., the human), but this compensation should be carefully developed. We provide a theoretical framework for algorithmic compensation that synthesizes game theory and reinforcement learning principles to demonstrate the natural emergence of deceptive outcomes from the continuous learning dynamics of agents. We provide simulation results involving Markov Decision Processes (MDP) learning to interact. This work then underpins our ethical analysis of the conditions in which AI agents should adapt to biases and behaviors of other agents in dynamic and complex decision-making environments. Overall, our approach addresses the nuanced role of strategic deception of humans, challenging previous assumptions about its detrimental effects. We assert that compensation for others' biases can enhance coordination and ethical alignment: strategic deception, when ethically managed, can positively shape human-AI interactions.",,第1页.xls
411,Future Trends for Human-AI Collaboration: A Comprehensive Taxonomy of AI/AGI Using Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles,2021,"This article discusses some trends and concepts in developing a new generation of future Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems which relate to complex facets and different types of human intelligence, especially social, emotional, attentional, and ethical intelligence. We describe various aspects of multiple human intelligences and learning styles, which may affect a variety of AI problem domains. Using the concept of multiple intelligences rather than a single type of intelligence, we categorize and provide working definitions of various AGIs depending on their cognitive skills or capacities. Future AI systems will be able not only to communicate with human users and each other but also to efficiently exchange knowledge and wisdom with abilities of cooperation, collaboration, and even cocreating something new and valuable and have metalearning capacities. Multiagent systems such as these can be used to solve problems that would be difficult to solve by any individual intelligent agent.",,第1页.xls
412,Discriminatory or Samaritan - which AI is needed for humanity? An Evolutionary Game Theory Analysis of Hybrid Human-AI populations [arXiv],2023,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly embedded in our lives, their presence leads to interactions that shape our behaviour, decision-making, and social interactions. Existing theoretical research has primarily focused on human-to-human interactions, overlooking the unique dynamics triggered by the presence of AI. In this paper, resorting to methods from evolutionary game theory, we study how different forms of AI influence the evolution of cooperation in a human population playing the one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma game in both well-mixed and structured populations. We found that Samaritan AI agents that help everyone unconditionally, including defectors, can promote higher levels of cooperation in humans than Discriminatory AI that only help those considered worthy/cooperative, especially in slow-moving societies where change is viewed with caution or resistance (small intensities of selection). Intuitively, in fast-moving societies (high intensities of selection), Discriminatory AIs promote higher levels of cooperation than Samaritan AIs.",,第1页.xls
413,ProactiveAgent: Personalized Context-Aware Reminder System,2023,"We introduce ProactiveAgent, a proactive application that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and personal agents to provide context-aware, personalized reminders and suggestions. By assimilating real-time environmental data, user histories, and verbal interactions, the system discerns user intent and ofers tailored recommendations. The application captures visual activity and spoken interactions, integrating them into short and long-term memory storage for context-rich decision support. We propose scenarios where ProactiveAgent could be valuable: suggesting snack options depending on the time, ofering culinary options based on dietary preferences, and even guiding users in their daily tasks. In envisioned use cases, ProactiveAgent could potentially track user attributes during their shopping experience, such as time spent on items and other cues, leading towards insightful product recommendations. Our work represents a potential advancement in the realm of personalized assistance, merging LLM strengths with personal agent technologies to enhance user decision-making in dynamic real-world scenarios.",,第1页.xls
414,Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck,2024,"Modern AI systems such as self-driving cars and game-playing agents achieve superhuman performance, but often lack human-like features such as generalization, interpretability and human inter-operability. Inspired by the rich interactions between language and decision-making in humans, we introduce Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck (PLLB), a framework enabling AI agents to generate linguistic rules that capture the strategies underlying their most rewarding behaviors. PLLB alternates between a rule generation step guided by language models, and an update step where agents learn new policies guided by rules. In a two-player communication game, a maze solving task, and two image reconstruction tasks, we show that PLLB agents are not only able to learn more interpretable and generalizable behaviors, but can also share the learned rules with human users, enabling more effective human-AI coordination.",,第1页.xls
415,Understanding the impact and design of AI teammate etiquette,2024,"Technical and practical advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to AI teammates working alongside humans in an area known as human-agent teaming. While critical past research has shown the benefit to trust driven by the incorporation of interaction rules and structures (i.e. etiquette) in both AI tools and robotic teammates, research has yet to explicitly examine etiquette for digital AI teammates. Given the historic importance of trust within human-agent teams, the identification of etiquette's impact within said teams should be paramount. Thus, this study empirically evaluates the impact of AI teammate etiquette through a mixed-methods study that compares AI teammates that either adhere to or ignore traditional etiquette standards for machine systems. The quantitative results show that traditional etiquette adherence leads to greater trust, perceived performance of the AI, and perceived performance of the team as a whole. However, qualitative results reveal that not all traditional etiquette behaviors have universal appeal due to the presence of individual differences. This research provides the first empirical and explicit exploration of etiquette within human-agent teams, and the results of this study should be used further design specific etiquette behaviors for AI teammates.",,第1页.xls
416,Composing with generative AI on digital advertising platforms,2024,"This study introduces online advertising platforms as digital composing tools where persuasive rhetoric encourages users to follow links and take action on landing pages. It frames these platforms as digital spaces where human actors work alongside non-human AI agents (Duin & Pedersen, 2021 & 2023) and where rhetorical agency emerges through the activity of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It theorizes a (human) user-centered approach to composing digital ads in digital advertising platforms built around Walton, Moore & Jones' (2019) framework of positionality, position, and power. It provides guidance for technical and professional writers in placing human users at the center of an abstracted, algorithm-driven partnership where generative AI appears poised to wrest power from both composers and users.

417,An explanation space to align user studies with the technical development of Explainable AI,2023,"Providing meaningful and actionable explanations for end-users is a situated problem requiring the intersection of multiple disciplines to address social, operational, and technical challenges. However, the explainable artificial intelligence community has not commonly adopted or created tangible design tools that allow interdisciplinary work to develop reliable AI-powered solutions. This paper proposes a formative architecture that defines the explanation space from a user-inspired perspective. The architecture comprises five intertwined components to outline explanation requirements for a task: (1) the end-users' mental models, (2) the end-users' cognitive process, (3) the user interface, (4) the Human-Explainer Agent, and (5) the agent process. We first define each component of the architecture. Then, we present the Abstracted Explanation Space, a modeling tool that aggregates the architecture's components to support designers in systematically aligning explanations with end-users' work practices, needs, and goals. It guides the specifications of what needs to be explained (content: end-users' mental model), why this explanation is necessary (context: end-users' cognitive process), to delimit how to explain it (format: Human-Explainer Agent and user interface), and when the explanations should be given. We then exemplify the tool's use in an ongoing case study in the aircraft maintenance domain. Finally, we discuss possible contributions of the tool, known limitations or areas for improvement, and future work to be done.",,第1页.xls
418,EMPATHIC: Emulating Human-Like Multimodal Personality Architecture Through Thoughtful Human-AI Conversation,2024,"In the evolving landscape of human-computer interaction, this paper introduces an innovative framework poised to revolutionize chatbot systems. Our framework, meticulously designed for emotionally aware multimodal chatbots, seamlessly integrates real-time face and emotion recognition with natural language processing. Currently in the developmental phase, the framework exhibits a distinctive proficiency in executing a diverse array of human instructions. These instructions span tasks such as generating detailed captions, object counting, and responding to general queries. Leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning from OpenFlamingo, augmented by the inclusion of the Low-rank Adapter (LoRA), our framework strategically prioritizes versatility and operational efficiency. The core of our approach lies in the establishment of instruction templates that intricately merge both vision and language data. This strategic integration forms the backbone of our multi-modality instruction tuning methodology, enhancing the adaptability of the chatbot. Recognizing the pivotal role of high-quality training data, we emphasize its significance in shaping the dialogue performance of the chatbot. As the framework progresses through its developmental stages, this research lays a robust foundation for the creation of a versatile conversational agent. The envisioned applications of this agent range from enhancing customer service experiences to providing valuable support in mental health scenarios.",,第1页.xls
419,Natural Language Specification of Reinforcement Learning Policies Through Differentiable Decision Trees,2023,"Human-AI policy specification is a novel procedure we define in which humans can collaboratively warm-start a robot's reinforcement learning policy. This procedure is comprised of two steps; (1) Policy Specification, i.e. humans specifying the behavior they would like their companion robot to accomplish, and (2) Policy Optimization, i.e. the robot applying reinforcement learning to improve the initial policy. Existing approaches to enabling collaborative policy specification are often unintelligible black-box methods, and are not catered towards making the autonomous system accessible to a novice end-user. In this letter, we develop a novel collaborative framework to allow humans to initialize and interpret an autonomous agent's behavior. Through our framework, we enable humans to specify an initial behavior model via unstructured, natural language (NL), which we convert to lexical decision trees. Next, we leverage these translated specifications, to warm-start reinforcement learning and allow the agent to further optimize these potentially suboptimal policies. Our approach warm-starts an RL agent by utilizing non-expert natural language specifications without incurring the additional domain exploration costs. We validate our approach by showing that our model is able to produce >$80% translation accuracy, and that policies initialized by a human can match the performance of relevant RL baselines in two domains.",,第1页.xls
420,Arny: A Study of a Co-creative Interaction Model Focused on Emotion Feedback,2020,"This paper presents an AI-based co-creative system in which the interaction model focuses on emotional feedback, that is, the decisions about the creative contribution from the AI agent is based on the emotion detected in the human co-creator. In human-human collaboration, gestures, verbal communications, and emotional responses are among the general communication strategies used to shape the interactions between the collaborators and negotiate the contributions. Emotional feedback allows human collaborators to passively communicate their experience and their perception of the process without distracting the flow of the task. In human-human co-creative collaboration, participants interact and contribute to the task based on their perception of the collaboration over time. In designing human-AI co-creative collaboration, we address two challenges: (1) perceiving the users cognitive state to determine the dynamics of collaboration, such as whether the system should lead, follow, or wait, and (2) deciding what the agent should contribute to the artifact. This paper presents a model of an AI agent that addresses these challenges and the results of our study of participants that interact with the co-creative agent.",,第1页.xls
421,Approximating Human Models During Argumentation-based Dialogues,2024,"Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) aims to develop AI agents that can effectively explain their decisions and actions to human users, fostering trust and facilitating human-AI collaboration. A key challenge in XAIP is model reconciliation, which seeks to align the mental models of AI agents and humans. While existing approaches often assume a known and deterministic human model, this simplification may not capture the complexities and uncertainties of real-world interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enables AI agents to learn and update a probabilistic human model through argumentation-based dialogues. Our approach incorporates trust-based and certainty-based update mechanisms, allowing the agent to refine its understanding of the human's mental state based on the human's expressed trust in the agent's arguments and certainty in their own arguments. We employ a probability weighting function inspired by prospect theory to capture the relationship between trust and perceived probability, and use a Bayesian approach to update the agent's probability distribution over possible human models. We conduct a human-subject study to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in an argumentation scenario, demonstrating its ability to capture the dynamics of human belief formation and adaptation.",,第1页.xls
422,Inform the Uninformed: Improving Online Informed Consent Reading with an AI-Powered Chatbot,2023,"Informed consent is a core cornerstone of ethics in human subject research. Through the informed consent process, participants learn about the study procedure, benefits, risks, and more to make an informed decision. However, recent studies showed that current practices might lead to uninformed decisions and expose participants to unknown risks, especially in online studies. Without the researcher's presence and guidance, online participants must read a lengthy form on their own with no answers to their questions. In this paper, we examined the role of an AI-powered chatbot in improving informed consent online. By comparing the chatbot with form-based interaction, we found the chatbot improved consent form reading, promoted participants' feelings of agency, and closed the power gap between the participant and the researcher. Our exploratory analysis further revealed the altered power dynamic might eventually benefit study response quality. We discussed design implications for creating AI-powered chatbots to offer effective informed consent in broader settings.",,第1页.xls
423,"I Lead, You Help But Only with Enough Details: Understanding the User Experience of Co-Creation with Artificial Intelligence",2018,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have increased the opportunities for users to interact with the technology. Now, users can even collaborate with AI in creative activities such as art. To understand the user experience in this new user-AI collaboration, we designed a prototype, DuetDraw, an AI interface that allows users and the AI agent to draw pictures collaboratively. We conducted a user study employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Thirty participants performed a series of drawing tasks with the think-aloud method, followed by post-hoc surveys and interviews. Our findings are as follows: (1) Users were significantly more content with DuetDraw when the tool gave detailed instructions. (2) While users always wanted to lead the task, they also wanted the AI to explain its intentions but only when the users wanted it to do so. (3) Although users rated the AI relatively low in predictability, controllability, and comprehensibility, they enjoyed their interactions with it during the task. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for user interfaces where users can collaborate with AI in creative works.",,第1页.xls
424,Detailed Analysis of Responses from Older Adults through Natural Speech: Comparison of Questions by AI Agents and Humans.,2024,"In recent years, an increasing number of studies have begun to use conversational data in spontaneous speech to estimate cognitive function in older people. The providers of spontaneous speech with older people used to be physicians and licensed psychologists, but it is now possible to have conversations with fully automatic AI agents. However, it has not yet been clarified what differences exist in conversational communication with older people when the examiner is either a human or an AI agent. In this study, elderly people living in the community and attending a silver human resource center and a day service center were the subjects. Dialogues were conducted using generic interview items for estimating cognitive function through daily conversation, which were developed through research on estimation methods for cognitive function. From the data obtained from the dialogues, we compared the effects of human-AI interaction on the number of utterances, speaking time, and silence time. This study was conducted at a facility in Japan and included 32 subjects (12 males and 20 females). The results showed significant differences between human and AI dialogue in the number of utterances and silent time. This study suggests the effectiveness of AI in communication with older people and explores the possibility of using AI in social welfare.",,第1页.xls
425,Quantifying Misalignment Between Agents,2024,"Growing concerns about the AI alignment problem have emerged in recent years, with previous work focusing mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a singular unit. Recent work in sociotechnical AI alignment has made some progress in defining alignment inclusively, but the field as a whole still lacks a systematic understanding of how to specify, describe, and analyze misalignment among entities, which may include individual humans, AI agents, and complex compositional entities such as corporations, nation-states, and so forth. Previous work on controversy in computational social science offers a mathematical model of contention among populations (of humans). In this paper, we adapt this contention model to the alignment problem, and show how misalignment can vary depending on the population of agents (human or otherwise) being observed, the domain in question, and the agents' probability-weighted preferences between possible outcomes. Our model departs from value specification approaches and focuses instead on the morass of complex, interlocking, sometimes contradictory goals that agents may have in practice. We apply our model by analyzing several case studies ranging from social media moderation to autonomous vehicle behavior. By applying our model with appropriately representative value data, AI engineers can ensure that their systems learn values maximally aligned with diverse human interests.",,第1页.xls
426,Mitigating knowledge imbalance in AI-advised decision-making through collaborative user involvement,2023,"Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) systems into decision-making tasks attempts to assist people by augment -ing or complementing their abilities and ultimately improve task performance. However, when considering recommendations from modern black boxintelligent systems, users are confronted with the decision of accepting or overriding AI's recommendations. These decisions are even more challenging to make when there exists a significant knowledge imbalance between the users and the AI system-namely, when people lack necessary task knowledge and are therefore unable to accurately complete the task on their own. In this work, we aim to understand people's behavior in AI-assisted decision-making tasks when faced with the challenge of knowledge imbalance and explore whether involving users in an AI's prediction generation process makes them more willing to follow the AI's recommendations and enhances their perception of collaboration. Our empirical study reveals that the involvement of users in generating AI recommendations during a task with notable knowledge imbalance causes them to be more willing to agree with the AI's suggestions and to perceive the AI agent and their collaboration as a team more positively.",,第1页.xls
427,Interactive AI-Generated Virtual Instructors Enhance Learning Motivation and Engagement in Financial Education,2024,"AI-generated virtual instructors powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment online learning by making it more interactive and personalized. In this work, we focus specifically on applying this technology to financial literacy education, a critical life skill that is unfortunately undertaught in most school systems. To investigate this potential, we developed three conditions for delivering financial education: A) a Passive Virtual Instructor, B) an Interactive Virtual Instructor powered by LLMs to enable two-way conversation with the learner, and C) a Personally Selected Interactive Virtual Instructor, allowing learners to choose their preferred AI instructor. In a study with 90 participants aged 18-25, we found that incorporating interactivity significantly improved learning motivation, perceived learning facilitation, engagement, and humanness compared to the passive agent. The ability to personally select an instructor provided little additional benefit for most measures. These results highlight the potential of interactive virtual instructors for enhancing motivational and experiential factors, even if comprehension itself is unaffected.",,第1页.xls
428,Impacts of AI-Generated Confidence and Explanations on Task Performance and Trust in Human-autonomy Teaming,2023,"In human-autonomy teaming (HAT), human operators and intelligent agents cooperate and coordinate together to achieve shared goals. This study aimed to enhance autonomy transparency by proposing the automatic generation of confidence and explanations (bounding boxes, and bounding boxes and keypoints) and investigating their impacts in HAT. A total of 36 participants engaged in a simulated surveillance task, during which they were assisted by the intelligent agents we designed using Keypoint Faster R-CNN. As a result, we found that visual explanations using bounding boxes and keypoints improved detection task performance only when confidence was not visualized. Moreover, participants had higher trust in and preference for autonomy when visual explanations were provided but whether confidence was visualized did not influence their trust and preference. These findings have implications for the design of autonomy and can facilitate human-machine interactions in HAT.",,第1页.xls
429,Tempering Transparency in Human-Robot Interaction,2023,"In recent years, particular interest has been taken by researchers and governments in examining and regulating aspects of transparency and explainability within artificially intelligent (AI) system. An AI system is transparent if humans can understand the mechanisms behind its behavior and use this understanding to make predictions about future behavior while the goal of explainable AI is to clarify an AI system's actions in a way that humans can understand. With this increased interest, research has presented conflicting views on the benefits of algorithmic transparency and explanations [1]. Moreover, research has also highlighted flaws within policy implementations of algorithmic transparency which generally remain too vague and often results in deficient adoption [2]. Even with these pitfalls of transparency, it seems as if the default view of many societies is that AI systems should be made more transparent and explainable; however, we argue that there needs to exist added skepticism of this position. In particular, we believe it is a useful exercise to consider exploring, as a counternarrative, an emerging area within computing that necessitates a lack of transparency-deceptive AI. The newly evolving area of research pertains to the creation (intentionally or not) of AI agents that learn to deceive humans and other AI agents. Here we define deception as the process by which actions are chosen to manipulate beliefs so as to take advantage of the erroneous inferences [3] and we use this interchangeably with lying. While there may be physically designed aspects of deception in embodied agents, such as the anthropomorphism and zoomorphism of robots [4], [5], here we wish to focus on deception related to utterances and actions of AI agents. On its surface, the idea of deceptive AI agents may not readily seem beneficial; however, there exists added effort to create AI agents that are able to be integrated socially within our societies. Seeing as deception is a foundational part of many human and animal groups, some argue that giving AI agents the ability to learn to deceive is necessary and inevitable for them to truly interact effectively [6], [7]. In fact, it has been found that deception can be an emergent behavior when training systems on human data [8]-thus strengthening the notion that behaving deceptively is a part of what it means to interact with humans. Moreover, prior research has shown that AI deception, rather than transparent truthfulness, can lead to better outcomes in human-robot interactions [9]-[11]. However, deception does of course have obvious drawbacks including an erosion of trust [12]-[15] and decreasing desired reutilization [12], [15]. Because of these negative aspects, and the clear possibly of malicious usage, some suggest the need for entirely truthful agents [16]. However, due to the infancy and lack of knowledge of the effects (short and long term) of deception within human-AI agent interaction, it is currently not possible to definitively determine the lasting implications of either encouraging or banning the practice. Given that transparency and explainability are in contention with deception, while also neither of the ideas are entirely beneficial nor detrimental, this presents important nuance when determining ethical and regulatory considerations of how AI agents should behave [17]. As such, the goal of this work is to present AI deception as a counternarrative to balance transparency and explainability with other considerations to spur discussions on how to be proactive, rather than reactive, to unforeseen consequences of our choices when designing AI systems that interact with humans.",,第1页.xls
430,A Unifying Bayesian Formulation of Measures of Interpretability in Human-AI Interaction,2021,"Existing approaches for generating human-aware agent behaviors have considered different measures of interpretability in isolation. Further, these measures have been studied under differing assumptions, thus precluding the possibility of designing a single framework that captures these measures under the same assumptions. In this paper, we present a unifying Bayesian framework that models a human observer's evolving beliefs about an agent and thereby define the problem of Generalized Human-Aware Planning. We will show that the definitions of interpretability measures like explicability, legibility and predictability from the prior literature fall out as special cases of our general framework. Through this framework, we also bring a previously ignored fact to light that the human-robot interactions are in effect open-world problems, with respect to the human's beliefs about the agent. The human may hold beliefs unknown to the agent and may also form new hypotheses about the agent when presented with novel or unexpected behaviors.",,第1页.xls
431,Cooperative Bayesian Optimization for Imperfect Agents [arXiv],2024,"We introduce a cooperative Bayesian optimization problem for optimizing black-box functions of two variables where two agents choose together at which points to query the function but have only control over one variable each. This setting is inspired by human-AI teamwork, where an AI-assistant helps its human user solve a problem, in this simplest case, collaborative optimization. We formulate the solution as sequential decision-making, where the agent we control models the user as a computationally rational agent with prior knowledge about the function. We show that strategic planning of the queries enables better identification of the global maximum of the function as long as the user avoids excessive exploration. This planning is made possible by using Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo planning and by endowing the agent with a user model that accounts for conservative belief updates and exploratory sampling of the points to query.",,第1页.xls
432,Designing Interactive Agents to Support Emotion Regulation in the Workplace through Guided Art-Making,2024,"Workplaces are high-pressure environments where employees often deal with infexible deadlines, instability in work relationships due to confict, and the expectations of deliverables - factors that exacerbate occupational stress and anxiety. While studies have demonstrated the efectiveness of therapeutic art-making interventions for supporting emotion regulation and alleviating occupational stress, there are few deliberate opportunities for employees to regulate their emotional state within the workplace. In this work, we present the design of a voice agent that can guide a user through a therapeutic art-making intervention to promote emotion regulation within the workplace. We share preliminary insights regarding the design of our voice agent, including the importance of embodiment and personalization. We also share insights about the feasibility of our proposed user study, which is aimed at evaluating the efectiveness of our voice agent at promoting emotion regulation in employees through therapeutic art-making.",,第1页.xls

434,Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Behavior Change Model for Designing Artificial Intelligence Chatbots to Promote Physical Activity and a Healthy Diet: Viewpoint,2020,"Background: Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet.Objective: The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations.Methods: We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model.Results: Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper.Conclusions: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.",,第1页.xls
435,A Survey on Population-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning,2023,"Many real-world applications can be described as large-scale games of imperfect information, which require extensive prior domain knowledge, especially in competitive or human-AI cooperation settings. Population-based training methods have become a popular solution to learn robust policies without any prior knowledge, which can generalize to policies of other players or humans. In this survey, we shed light on population-based deep reinforcement learning (PB-DRL) algorithms, their applications, and general frameworks. We introduce several independent subject areas, including naive self-play, fictitious self-play, population-play, evolution-based training methods, and the policy-space response oracle family. These methods provide a variety of approaches to solving multi-agent problems and are useful in designing robust multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle complex real-life situations. Finally, we discuss challenges and hot topics in PB-DRL algorithms. We hope that this brief survey can provide guidance and insights for researchers interested in PB-DRL algorithms.",,第1页.xls
436,Increasing Human-Likeness and Acceptance of Conversational Autonomy through Experience,2024,"An increasing number of online platforms offer access to conversational artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, allowing individuals to engage and talk with AI. Conversing using natural language may foster perceptions of AI as having more human-like qualities. Within the context of human-autonomy teaming (HAT), this may contribute to AI being viewed more as a human-like teammate than an instrumental tool. The present research investigated factors that influenced the perceptions of conversational AI as a human-like teammate. Using the autonomous agent teammate-likeness (AAT) framework, participants were presented with simulated conversations between an AI and user within a smartphone app across multiple contexts. Participants were more likely to rate the AI as a human-like teammate with increased exposure to conversations, when they had a less negative attitude towards robots, and with greater general propensity to trust. In addition, perceptions of human-likeness were associated with (stronger) perceptions of the AI as trustworthy, useful, and acceptable. This suggests that fostering human-likeness via experience with natural language conversations can contribute to AI being perceived more like a human teammate and improve (HAT) outcomes.",,第1页.xls
437,Empirically Evaluating Creative Arc Negotiation for Improvisational Decision-making,2021,"Action selection from many options with few constraints is crucial for improvisation and co-creativity. Our previous work proposed creative arc negotiation to solve this problem, i.e., selecting actions to follow an author-defined 'creative arc' or trajectory over estimates of novelty, unexpectedness, and quality for potential actions. The CARNIVAL agent architecture demonstrated this approach for playing the Props game from improv theatre in the Robot Improv Circus installation. This article evaluates the creative arc negotiation experience with CARNIVAL through two crowdsourced observer studies and one improviser laboratory study. The studies focus on subjects' ability to identify creative arcs in performance and their preference for creative arc negotiation compared to a random selection baseline. Our results show empirically that observers successfully identified creative arcs in performances. Both groups also preferred creative arc negotiation in agent creativity and logical coherence, while observers enjoyed it more too.",,第1页.xls
438,An integrative model of autonomous agent teammate-likeness,2018,"Advancements in autonomy are beginning to allow humans to partner with machines in order to accomplish work tasks in various settings. As human-agent teaming (HAT) becomes more prevalent as a research topic, the need to understand humans psychological perceptions of the machine partner is increasingly important, especially in terms of its perceived role, which may ultimately impact trust and team effectiveness. Specifically, it remains unclear how humans perceive intelligent agents and how consistent these perceptions are with existing taxonomies found in the psychology of teams. The present paper presents a definition of the construct ofautonomous agent teammate-likeness(AAT) and a conceptual model of its components, reviews related concepts and germane research and proffers a number of propositions to guide future research. The goal is to contribute to the nascent literature on HAT by establishing a theoretical foundation for the AAT construct, upon which researchers can advance research on HAT.",,第1页.xls
439,Designing a Proactive Context-Aware AI Chatbot for People's Long-Term Goals,2024,"When pursuing new complex goals such as fitness or sustainability, people often seek advice from various sources. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have recently emerged as popular sources for information seeking, action discovery, and goal planning. However, such tools require users to provide detailed prompts, are not adaptive to the user's personal attributes or real-time contexts, and are merely reactive to the user's prompts rather than proactively guiding the user at opportune moments. We share the design of an LLM-based chatbot app that proactively recommends actions to the user for their goals based on context factors that can be detected or inferred by the user's smartphone (e.g., location, time, weather) and the user's personal profile. An early pilot field study reveals that participants enjoyed the chatbot as a personal assistant that was adaptable and flexible to their needs and kept them motivated by discovering actions toward their goals.",,第1页.xls
440,How Human Centered AI Will Contribute Towards Intelligent Gaming Systems,2021,"A paradigm shift towards human-centered intelligent gaming systems is gradually setting in. Such intelligent gaming systems with embedded machine learning algorithms would explain player motivations, help design more personalized single and collaborative player experiences, transfer and generalize the learning from game to game. The multi-modal user behavior trajectories, both in-game and across various platforms, incorporate heterogeneous information and graph structures. These gaming modalities range from text, audios, video demos, activity replays, and social networks to psychological questionnaires. Identifying decision-making patterns and strategies by observing in-game behavior actions and mining heterogeneous sources could construct a more holistic representation of the gaming community. Human priors publicly available on the World Wide Web would inspire the modeling for human-like non-player characters, adaptive recommendation systems, automatic game design, testing, and human-AI collaborations. My doctoral research goal is to mine, represent, and learn from human priors existing in the interactive entertainment community's heterogeneous sources and introduce ways to model single and multi-agent interactive behavior patterns.",,第1页.xls
441,Diverse Conventions for Human-AI Collaboration,2023,"Conventions are crucial for strong performance in cooperative multi-agent games, because they allow players to coordinate on a shared strategy without explicit communication. Unfortunately, standard multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, such as self-play, converge to conventions that are arbitrary and non-diverse, leading to poor generalization when interacting with new partners. In this work, we present a technique for generating diverse conventions by (1) maximizing their rewards during self-play, while (2) minimizing their rewards when playing with previously discovered conventions (cross-play), stimulating conventions to be semantically different. To ensure that learned policies act in good faith despite the adversarial optimization of cross-play, we introduce mixed-play, where an initial state is randomly generated by sampling self-play and cross-play transitions and the player learns to maximize the self-play reward from this initial state. We analyze the benefits of our technique on various multi-agent collaborative games, including Overcooked, and find that our technique can adapt to the conventions of humans, surpassing human-level performance when paired with real users.",,第1页.xls
442,Preferred Appearance of Embodied Conversational Agents in Knowledge Management,2021,"This paper deals with the investigation of the preferred appearance of embodied conversational agents (ECA) in the context of knowledge management. ECAs are artificial intelligence-based systems that are used in different contexts and support scenarios to assist human users and jointly work with them. An important aspect is the design and especially the appearance, which influences acceptance, interaction quality, and overall work performance. An online survey was used to determine preferred appearances of ECAs that are specifically used in the context of knowledge management. With a total of 104 participants, the results yielded findings for the appearance, kinetics, proxemics, and communication of ECAs in knowledge management. Participants expressed their preferences towards a realistic and human appearance, which speaks for a desire for human-like artificial intelligence. The results contribute to the practical design of ECAs as well as to existing theories on human-AI interaction, such as anthropomorphisms.",,第1页.xls
443,Modeling Moral Choices in Social Dilemmas with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,2023,"Practical uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the real world have demonstrated the importance of embedding moral choices into intelligent agents. They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of moral rewards in social dilemmas.In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue (e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies.",,第1页.xls
444,Maximum Entropy Population-Based Training for Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination,2023,"We study the problem of training a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that is collaborative with humans without using human data. Although such agents can be obtained through self-play training, they can suffer significantly from the distributional shift when paired with unencountered partners, such as humans. In this paper, we propose Maximum Entropy Population-based training (MEP) to mitigate such distributional shift. In MEP, agents in the population are trained with our derived Population Entropy bonus to promote the pairwise diversity between agents and the individual diversity of agents themselves. After obtaining this diversified population, a common best agent is trained by paring with agents in this population via prioritized sampling, where the prioritization is dynamically adjusted based on the training progress. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method MEP, with comparison to Self-Play PPO (SP), Population-Based Training (PBT), Trajectory Diversity (TrajeDi), and Fictitious CoPlay (FCP) in both matrix game and Overcooked game environments, with partners being human proxy models and real humans.

445,Service robots in a multi-party setting: An examination of robots' ability to detect human-to-human conflict and its effects on robot evaluations,2024,"When we need service, we will soon be interacting with various non-human AI-powered agents. In the first phase of a transformation from human-to-human to human-to-robot service encounters, it can also be expected that many of us will share the same robot in multi-party settings in which several users are present at the same time. This setting is particularly challenging for a service robot when users have conflicting demands for what the robot should do. And conflicts are ubiquitous in human behavior. The present study examines this understudied situation with an experimental approach: a service robot's ability to detect inter-user conflicts was manipulated (low vs. high) in a domestic setting (a kitchen). The results show that a service robot with a high conflict-detection ability boosted (1) the perceived usefulness of the robot and (2) overall robot evaluations.

446,Relationship Between Trust in the Artificial Intelligence Creator and Trust in Artificial Intelligence Systems: The Crucial Role of Artificial Intelligence Alignment and Steerability,2024,"This paper offers a novel perspective on trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, focusing on the transfer of user trust in AI creators to trust in AI systems. Using the agentic information systems (IS) framework, we investigate the role of AI alignment and steerability in trust transference. Through four randomized experiments, we probe three key alignment-related attributes of AI systems: creator-based steerability, user-based steerability, and autonomy. Results indicate that creator-based steerability amplifies trust transference from AI creator to AI system, while user-based steerability and autonomy diminish it. Our findings suggest that AI alignment efforts should consider the entity with which the AI goals and values should be aligned and highlight the need for research to theorize from a triadic view encompassing the user, the AI system, and its creator. Given the diversity in individual goals and values, we recommend that developers move beyond the prevailing one-size-fits-all alignment strategy. Our findings contribute to trust transference theory by highlighting the boundary conditions under which trust transference breaks down or holds in the emerging human-AI environment.",,第1页.xls
447,Perceived Trustworthiness of Human vs. AI Instructors in Digital Privacy Education for Older Adults,2024,"Recent work highlights digital privacy education as a crucial component in overcoming the digital literacy gap among seniors, but also shows that seniors distrust AI systems and prefer a more personable education experience. To this end, we conducted a within-subjects experiment to explore the pivotal role of trust in digital privacy education for older adults, with a specific focus on how the physical characteristics of instructors-human and AI-influence trust levels. In our study, 36 younger and 27 older participants evaluated 9 introductions to a video tutorial on digital privacy, featuring 3 AI and 6 human instructors (the latter varying by age and gender). Analysis revealed that trust towards the AI instructors was lower than towards the human instructors. Among the AI instructors, a robot with human-like features was the most trusted, while among the human instructors, the older and middle-aged female instructors were the most trusted. Furthermore, participant demographics such as gender and rurality were found to moderate trust levels. This research has implications for instructional design and technology acceptance, particularly in addressing privacy concerns and fostering inclusive digital literacy among the senior population.",,第1页.xls
448,Video Segmentation Pipeline For Co-Creative AI Dance Application,2024,"This article introduces a method that combines human input and computation for analyzing human motion from video recordings, specifically for capturing dance movements. The central aim is to develop an innovative system for processing and analyzing videos. This system consists of four key stages: using pre-trained MediaPipe models for interactive image segmentation, organizing videos efficiently through batching, identifying and extracting keyframes, and pinpointing accurate timestamps of keyframes. This pipeline is a part of LuminAI, an interactive installation that features a virtual AI agent capable of improvising movements in collaboration with human participants. In particular, the proposed pipeline fits into the first software module of LuminAI, responsible for recognizing and segmenting continuous motion capture data into separate body actions. The proposed video segmentation pipeline is designed to fulfill the requirements for both qualitative and quantitative analyses in designing systems that classify human movements. This research advances our knowledge of human motion through video analysis and bridges the gap between technology and artistic expression.",,第1页.xls

450,New Approach in Human-AI Interaction by Reinforcement-Imitation Learning,2021,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides effective results with an agent learning from a stand-alone reward function. However, it presents unique challenges with large amounts of environment states and action spaces, as well as in the determination of rewards. Imitation Learning (IL) offers a promising solution for those challenges using a teacher. In IL, the learning process can take advantage of human-sourced assistance and/or control over the agent and environment. A human teacher and an agent learner are considered in this study. The teacher takes part in the agent's training towards dealing with the environment, tackling a specific objective, and achieving a predefined goal. This paper proposes a novel approach combining IL with different types of RL methods, namely, state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Agents (A3C), to overcome the problems of both stand-alone systems. How to effectively leverage the teacher's feedback-be it direct binary or indirect detailed-for the agent learner to learn sequential decision-making policies is addressed. The results of this study on various OpenAI-Gym environments show that this algorithmic method can be incorporated with different combinations, and significantly decreases both human endeavors and tedious exploration process.",,第1页.xls

452,Selectively Providing Reliance Calibration Cues With Reliance Prediction [arXiv],2023,"For effective collaboration between humans and intelligent agents that employ machine learning for decision-making, humans must understand what agents can and cannot do to avoid over/under-reliance. A solution to this problem is adjusting human reliance through communication using reliance calibration cues (RCCs) to help humans assess agents' capabilities. Previous studies typically attempted to calibrate reliance by continuously presenting RCCs, and when an agent should provide RCCs remains an open question. To answer this, we propose Pred-RC, a method for selectively providing RCCs. Pred-RC uses a cognitive reliance model to predict whether a human will assign a task to an agent. By comparing the prediction results for both cases with and without an RCC, Pred-RC evaluates the influence of the RCC on human reliance. We tested Pred-RC in a human-AI collaboration task and found that it can successfully calibrate human reliance with a reduced number of RCCs.",,第1页.xls
453,Interaction and Resistance: The Recognition of Intentions in New Human-Computer Interaction,2011,"Just as AI has moved away from classical AI, human-computer interaction (HCI) must move away from what I call 'good old fashioned HCI' to 'new HCI' - it must become a part of cognitive systems research where HCI is one case of the interaction of intelligent agents (we now know that interaction is essential for intelligent agents anyway). For such interaction, we cannot just 'analyze the data', but we must assume intentions in the other, and I suggest these are largely recognized through resistance to carrying out one's own intentions. This does not require fully cognitive agents but can start at a very basic level. New HCI integrates into cognitive systems research and designs intentional systems that provide resistance to the human agent.",,第1页.xls
454,Artificial social influence via human-embodied AI agent interaction in immersive virtual reality (VR): Effects of similarity-matching during health conversations,2024,"Interactions with artificial intelligence (AI) based agents can positively influence human behavior and judgment. However, studies to date focus on text-based conversational agents (CA) with limited embodiment, restricting our understanding of how social influence principles, such as similarity, apply to AI agents (i.e., artificial social influence). We address this gap by leveraging the latest advances in AI (language models) and combining them with immersive virtual reality (VR). Specifically, we built VR-ECAs, or embodied conversational agents that can naturally converse with humans about health-related topics in a virtual environment. Then we manipulated human-agent similarity via gender matching and examined its effects on biobehavioral (i.e., gaze), social (e.g., agent likeability), and behavioral outcomes (i.e., healthy snack selection). We found that discussing health with opposite-gender agents enhanced gaze duration and the likelihood of healthy snack selection. In addition, female participants liked the VR-ECAs more than their male counterparts, regardless of the gender of the VR-ECAs. Finally, participants experienced greater presence while conversing with VR-embodied agents than chatting with text-only agents. Overall, our findings highlight embodiment as a crucial factor in how AI influences human behavior, and our paradigm enables new experimental research at the intersection of social influence, human-AI communication, and immersive virtual reality (VR).",,第1页.xls

456,How Visualising Emotions Affects Interpersonal Trust and Task Collaboration in a Shared Virtual Space,2023,"Emotion is dynamic. Changes in emotion can be hard to process during face-to-face interaction, yet transferring them into a shared virtual space becomes more challenging. This research first explores nine visual representations to amplify emotions in a virtual space, leading to a bi-directional emotion-sharing system (FeelMoji i/o). The second study investigates the effect of explicit emotion-sharing in interpersonal trust and task collaboration through three conditions - verbal only, verbal+positive visual, and verbal+honest visual using FeelMoji through the proposal of a framework of four factors (usability, integrity, behaviour, and collaboration). The results indicate that FeelMoji yields frequent emotion consensus as task milestones and positive interdependent behaviours between collaborators, which help develop conversations, affirm decision-making, and build familiarity and trust between strangers. Moreover, we discuss how our study can inspire future investigation in human-AI agent behaviours and large-scale multi-user virtual environments.",,第1页.xls

Enabled through the rapid progression of artificial intelligence, a human-autonomy team (HAT) involves one or more autonomous computerized agents collaborating with humans on interdependent tasks toward the achievement of a common goal. Whereas research on HATs is exploding in recent years, that research has not strongly embraced the vast literature, theory, and methods already developed in the all-human teaming literature. Moreover, definitional and construct validity issues, in terms of what constitutes a HAT, persist in the literature. In the current article we offer construct clarity and we integrate the Input-Mediator-Output model from the high-performance teaming literature to help future researchers classify the variables under study, theorize deeper, and consolidate findings across studies. Both the construct clarity we offer and our theoretical integration will serve as a valuable perspective for contextualizing the studies in the current as well as in designing and interpreting future research in the HAT area.

459,Collaborating with a Text-Based Chatbot: An Exploration of Real-World Collaboration Strategies Enacted during Human-Chatbot Interactions,2023,"A central problem for chatbots in the customer care domain revolves around how people collaborate with the agent to achieve their own situated goals. The majority of the previous research, however, relied on experiments within artificial settings, rather than on observation of real-world interactions. Moreover, such research mostly analyzed users' responses to communication breakdowns, rather than the wider collaboration strategies utilized during a conversation. In this paper, we qualitatively analyzed 12,477 real-world exchanges with a task-based chatbot using a Grounded Theory approach as a rigorous coding method to analyze the data. We identifed two main aspects of collaboration, behavioral and conversational, and for each aspect we highlighted the different strategies that users perform to work together with the agent. These strategies may be utilized from the very beginning of the conversation or in response to misunderstandings in the course of ongoing interactions and may show different evolving dynamics.",,第1页.xls

(2) Human-in-the-loop infrastructure: enabling real human interaction with simulated robots via mouse/keyboard or a VR interface, facilitating evaluation of robot policies with human input. (3) Collaborative tasks: studying two collaborative tasks, Social Navigation and Social Rearrangement. Social Navigation investigates a robot's ability to locate and follow humanoid avatars in unseen environments, whereas Social Rearrangement addresses collaboration between a humanoid and robot while rearranging a scene. These contributions allow us to study end-to-end learned and heuristic baselines for human-robot collaboration in-depth, as well as evaluate them with humans in the loop. Our experiments demonstrate that learned robot policies lead to efficient task completion when collaborating with unseen humanoid agents and human partners that might exhibit behaviors that the robot has not seen before. Additionally, we observe emergent behaviors during collaborative task execution, such as the robot yielding space when obstructing a humanoid agent, thereby allowing the effective completion of the task by the humanoid agent. Furthermore, our experiments using the human-in-the-loop tool demonstrate that our automated evaluation with humanoids can provide an indication of the relative ordering of different policies when evaluated with real human collaborators. Habitat 3.0 unlocks interesting new features in simulators for Embodied AI, and we hope it paves the way for a new frontier of embodied human-AI interaction capabilities.",,第1页.xls
461,Using Empathic Mixed Reality Agents for Remote Collaboration,2023,"This paper describes research on using Empathic Mixed Reality Agents (EMiRAs) for enhancing remote collaboration. Adopting Mixed Reality (MR) for remote collaboration is a promising solution which uses virtual avatars and visual cues to allow people to communicate naturally in three-dimensional (3D) MR environments. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) make it possible to form hybrid teams of humans and AI driven virtual agents in MR environments. Forming hybrid teams to enhance human-to-human collaboration could be a promising way to take advantage of the complementary nature of human and AI agents. However, there still needs to be research conducted on how hybrid teams like this can improve MR remote collaboration. My research is focused on designing and evaluating EMiRAs for enhancing human-to-human remote collaboration. In this doctoral consortium presentation, I will introduce the EMiRA concept by identifying the convergence of Empathic Computing, MR and AI Agent. In the paper, I discuss the research motivation, recently published study results and plans for future work.",,第1页.xls
462,On the Utility of Learning about Humans for Human-AI Coordination,2019,"While we would like agents that can coordinate with humans, current algorithms such as self-play and population-based training create agents that can coordinate with themselves. Agents that assume their partner to be optimal or similar to them can converge to coordination protocols that fail to understand and be understood by humans. To demonstrate this, we introduce a simple environment that requires challenging coordination, based on the popular game Overcooked, and learn a simple model that mimics human play. We evaluate the performance of agents trained via self-play and population-based training. These agents perform very well when paired with themselves, but when paired with our human model, they are significantly worse than agents designed to play with the human model. An experiment with a planning algorithm yields the same conclusion, though only when the human-aware planner is given the exact human model that it is playing with. A user study with real humans shows this pattern as well, though less strongly. Qualitatively, we find that the gains come from having the agent adapt to the human's gameplay. Given this result, we suggest several approaches for designing agents that learn about humans in order to better coordinate with them.",,第1页.xls
463,Decision-Oriented Dialogue for Human-AI Collaboration,2024,"We describe a class of tasks called decision-oriented dialogues, in which AI assistants such as large language models (LMs) must collaborate with one or more humans via natural language to help them make complex decisions. We formalize three domains in which users face everyday decisions: (1) choosing an assignment of reviewers to conference papers, (2) planning a multi-step itinerary in a city, and (3) negotiating travel plans for a group of friends. In each of these settings, AI assistants and users have disparate abilities that they must combine to arrive at the best decision: Assistants can access and process large amounts of information, while users have preferences and constraints external to the system. For each task, we build a dialogue environment where agents receive a reward based on the quality of the final decision they reach. We evaluate LMs in self-play and in collaboration with humans and find that they fall short compared to human assistants, achieving much lower rewards despite engaging in longer dialogues. We highlight a number of challenges models face in decision-oriented dialogues, ranging from goal-directed behavior to reasoning and optimization, and release our environments as a testbed for future work.",,第1页.xls
464,The Illusion of Empathy? Notes on Displays of Emotion in Human-Computer Interaction,2024,"From ELIZA to Alexa, Conversational Agents (CAs) have been deliberately designed to elicit or project empathy. Although empathy can help technology better serve human needs, it can also be deceptive and potentially exploitative. In this work, we characterize empathy in interactions with CAs, highlighting the importance of distinguishing evocations of empathy between two humans from ones between a human and a CA. To this end, we systematically prompt CAs backed by large language models (LLMs) to display empathy while conversing with, or about, 65 distinct human identities, and also compare how diferent LLMs display or model empathy. We fnd that CAs make value judgments about certain identities, and can be encouraging of identities related to harmful ideologies (e.g., Nazism and xenophobia). Moreover, a computational approach to understanding empathy reveals that despite their ability to display empathy, CAs do poorly when interpreting and exploring a user's experience, contrasting with their human counterparts.",,第1页.xls
465,ELLA: Exploration through Learned Language Abstraction,2021,"Building agents capable of understanding language instructions is critical to effective and robust human-AI collaboration. Recent work focuses on training these agents via reinforcement learning in environments with synthetic language; however, instructions often define long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks, and learning policies requires many episodes of experience. We introduce ELLA: Exploration through Learned Language Abstraction, a reward shaping approach geared towards boosting sample efficiency in sparse reward environments by correlating high-level instructions with simpler low-level constituents. ELLA has two key elements: 1) A termination classifier that identifies when agents complete low-level instructions, and 2) A relevance classifier that correlates low-level instructions with success on high-level tasks. We learn the termination classifier offline from pairs of instructions and terminal states. Notably, in departure from prior work in language and abstraction, we learn the relevance classifier online, without relying on an explicit decomposition of high-level instructions to low-level instructions. On a suite of complex BabyAI [11] environments with varying instruction complexities and reward sparsity, ELLA shows gains in sample efficiency relative to language-based shaping and traditional RL methods.",,第1页.xls
466,For What It'sWorth: Humans Overwrite Their Economic Self-interest to Avoid Bargaining With AI Systems,2022,"As algorithms are increasingly augmenting and substituting human decision-making, understanding how the introduction of computational agents changes the fundamentals of human behavior becomes vital. This pertains to not only users, but also those parties who face the consequences of an algorithmic decision. In a controlled experiment with 480 participants, we exploit an extended version of two-player ultimatum bargaining where responders choose to bargain with either another human, another human with an AI decision aid or an autonomous AI-system acting on behalf of a passive human proposer. Our results show strong responder preferences against the algorithm, as most responders opt for a human opponent and demand higher compensation to reach a contract with autonomous agents. To map these preferences to economic expectations, we elicit incentivized subject beliefs about their opponent's behavior. The majority of responders maximize their expected value when this is line with approaching the human proposer. In contrast, responders predicting income maximization for the autonomous AI-system overwhelmingly override economic self-interest to avoid the algorithm.",,第1页.xls
467,How does anthropomorphism improve human-AI interaction satisfaction: a dual-path model,2023,"With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of anthropomorphism has been established as a good design principle. However, the effectiveness of anthropomorphism in smart home assistants is still unclear, as is the mechanism influencing interaction satisfaction. Therefore, we have categorized the anthropomorphic cues of smart home assistants into four dimensions: visual, identity, emotional, and auditory, and constructed a dual-path influence mechanism model of anthropomorphism on interaction satisfaction. Furthermore, we also consider the different influences of different usage contexts. Through two experimental studies, the results show that, in the intimacy influence path, the emotional cue and auditory cue can directly improve interaction satisfaction, and they can further improve interaction satisfaction by affecting intimacy. However, the visual cue has no significant direct effect on interaction satisfaction. The visual cue mainly improves interaction satisfaction through the intermediate effect of intimacy. In the privacy invasion influence path, the emotional cue and auditory cue also further affect interaction satisfaction by affecting privacy invasion. However, the impact of the visual cue and identity cue on privacy invasion was not valid. The study is expected to provide practical guidance for product designers to realize the long-term feasibility and sustainability of products. All rights reserved Elsevier.",,第1页.xls
468,A Statistical Framework for Measuring AI Reliance [arXiv],2024,"Humans frequently make decisions with the aid of artificially intelligent (AI) systems. A common pattern is for the AI to recommend an action to the human who retains control over the final decision. Researchers have identified ensuring that a human has appropriate reliance on an AI as a critical component of achieving complementary performance. We argue that the current definition of appropriate reliance used in such research lacks formal statistical grounding and can lead to contradictions. We propose a formal definition of reliance, based on statistical decision theory, which separates the concepts of reliance as the probability the decision-maker follows the AI's prediction from challenges a human may face in differentiating the signals and forming accurate beliefs about the situation. Our definition gives rise to a framework that can be used to guide the design and interpretation of studies on human-AI complementarity and reliance. Using recent AI-advised decision making studies from literature, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to separate the loss due to mis-reliance from the loss due to not accurately differentiating the signals. We evaluate these losses by comparing to a baseline and a benchmark for complementary performance defined by the expected payoff achieved by a rational agent facing the same decision task as the behavioral agents.",,第1页.xls
469,Learning Agent-based Modeling with LLM Companions: Experiences of Novices and Experts Using ChatGPT & NetLogo Chat,2024,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fundamentally change the way people engage in computer programming. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become ubiquitous in natural and social sciences and education, yet no prior studies have explored the potential of LLMs to assist it. We designed NetLogo Chat to support the learning and practice of NetLogo, a programming language for ABM. To understand how users perceive, use, and need LLM-based interfaces, we interviewed 30 participants from global academia, industry, and graduate schools. Experts reported more perceived benefits than novices and were more inclined to adopt LLMs in their workflow. We found significant differences between experts and novices in their perceptions, behaviors, and needs for human-AI collaboration. We surfaced a knowledge gap between experts and novices as a possible reason for the benefit gap. We identified guidance, personalization, and integration as major needs for LLM-based interfaces to support the programming of ABM.",,第1页.xls
470,Teaming With a Synthetic Teammate: Insights into Human-Autonomy Teaming,2018,"Objective Three different team configurations are compared with the goal of better understanding human-autonomy teaming (HAT).Background Although an extensive literature on human-automation interaction exists, much less is known about HAT in which humans and autonomous agents interact as coordinated units. Further research must be conducted to better understand how all-human teams compare to HAT.Methods In an unmanned aerial system (UAS) context, a comparison was made among three types of three-member teams: (1) synthetic teams in which the pilot role is assigned to a synthetic teammate, (2) control teams in which the pilot was an inexperienced human, and (3) experimenter teams in which an experimenter served as an experienced pilot. Ten of each type of team participated. Measures of team performance, target processing efficiency, team situation awareness, and team verbal behaviors were analyzed.Results Synthetic teams performed as well at the mission level as control (all human) teams but processed targets less efficiently. Experimenter teams performed better across all other measures compared to control and synthetic teams.Conclusion Though there is potential for a synthetic agent to function as a full-fledged teammate, further advances in autonomy are needed to improve team-level dynamics in HAT teams.Application This research contributes to our understanding of how to make autonomy a good team player.",,第1页.xls
471,Agent-in-the-Loop: Conversational Agent Support in Service of Reflection for Learning During Collaborative Programming,2020,"Dynamic conversational agent-based support for collaborative learning has shown significant positive effects on learning over no support or static-support control conditions in prior studies. In order to understand the boundary between human-led and AI-led support for collaboration, we compare in this study an approach where the agent's primary role is to help students regulate their own collaboration with two more typical prompting strategies that are used only during a reflection phase: one designed to provide a specific informational focus for the reflection, and the other designed to draw out evaluation, elaboration, and exploration of alternative perspectives. Significant positive effects on learning over and above just the human-led form of support are observed when either of the prompting strategies are used.",,第1页.xls
472,Collaborative Learning with Artificial Intelligence Speakers,2024,"This research aims to demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI) can function not only as a tool for learning, but also as an intelligent agent with which humans can engage in collaborative learning (CL) to change epistemic practices in science classrooms. We adopted a design and development research approach, following the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation (ADDIE) model, to prototype a tangible instructional system called Collaborative Learning with AI Speakers (CLAIS). The CLAIS system is designed to have 3-4 human learners join an AI speaker to form a small group, where humans and AI are considered peers participating in the Jigsaw learning process. The development was carried out using the NUGU AI speaker platform. The CLAIS system was successfully implemented in a Science Education course session with 15 pre-service elementary science teachers. The participants evaluated the CLAIS system through mixed methods surveys as teachers, learners, peers, and users. Quantitative data showed that the participants' Intelligent-Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge was significantly increased after the CLAIS session, the perception of the CLAIS learning experience was positive, the peer assessment on AI speakers and human peers was different, and the user experience was ambivalent. Qualitative data showed that the participants came to anticipate future changes in the epistemic process in science classrooms, while acknowledging technical issues such as speech recognition and response latency. This study highlights the potential of human-AI collaboration for knowledge co-construction in authentic classroom settings and exemplifies how AI could shape the future landscape of epistemic practices in the classroom.",,第1页.xls
473,LAVE: LLM-Powered Agent Assistance and Language Augmentation for Video Editing,2024,"Video creation has become increasingly popular, yet the expertise and effort required for editing often pose barriers to beginners. In this paper, we explore the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the video editing workflow to reduce these barriers. Our design vision is embodied in LAVE, a novel system that provides LLM-powered agent assistance and language-augmented editing features. LAVE automatically generates language descriptions for the user's footage, serving as the foundation for enabling the LLM to process videos and assist in editing tasks. When the user provides editing objectives, the agent plans and executes relevant actions to fulfill them. Moreover, LAVE allows users to edit videos through either the agent or direct UI manipulation, providing flexibility and enabling manual refinement of agent actions. Our user study, which included eight participants ranging from novices to proficient editors, demonstrated LAVE's effectiveness. The results also shed light on user perceptions of the proposed LLM-assisted editing paradigm and its impact on users' creativity and sense of co-creation. Based on these findings, we propose design implications to inform the future development of agent-assisted content editing.",,第1页.xls
474,"Racism, responsibility and autonomy in HCI: testing perceptions of an AI agent",2019,"This study employs an experiment to test subjects' perceptions of an artificial intelligence (AI) crime-predicting agent that produces clearly racist predictions. It used a 2 (human crime predictor/AI crime predictor) x 2 (high/low seriousness of crime) design to test the relationship between the level of autonomy and responsibility for the unjust results. The seriousness of crime was manipulated to examine the relationship between the perceived threat and trust in the authority's decisions. Participants (N = 334) responded to an online questionnaire after reading one of four scenarios with the same story depicting a crime predictor unjustly reporting a higher likelihood of subsequent crimes for a black defendant than for a white defendant for similar crimes. The results indicate that people think that an AI crime predictor has significantly less autonomy than a human crime predictor. However, both the identity of the crime predictor and the seriousness of the crime showed insignificant results on the level of responsibility assigned to the predictor. Also, a clear positive relationship between autonomy and responsibility was found in both human and AI crime predictor scenarios. The implications of the findings for applications and theory are discussed. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第1页.xls
475,Evaluating the Impact of the Human-Agent Teamwork Communication Model (HAT-CoM) on the Development of a Shared Mental Model,2013,"It is well known that the development of a Shared Mental Model (SMM) leads to better teamwork performance. Communication of shared knowledge is considered a crucial factor in successful teamwork. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of applying a proposed Human-Agent Teamwork Communication Model, namely HAT-CoM, on the development of SMM between human and agent teammates. Another aim of the paper is to investigate the impact of an implausible or unreasonable request on the SMM. The results show that HAT-CoM is effective in assisting the human and agent teammates to develop SMM. In addition, the results show that an implausible request breaks the developed SMM.",,第1页.xls
476,Towards a Neural Era in Dialogue Management for Collaboration: A Literature Survey [arXiv],2023,"Dialogue-based human-AI collaboration can revolutionize collaborative problem-solving, creative exploration, and social support. To realize this goal, the development of automated agents proficient in skills such as negotiating, following instructions, establishing common ground, and progressing shared tasks is essential. This survey begins by reviewing the evolution of dialogue management paradigms in collaborative dialogue systems, from traditional handcrafted and information-state based methods to AI planning-inspired approaches. It then shifts focus to contemporary data-driven dialogue management techniques, which seek to transfer deep learning successes from form-filling and open-domain settings to collaborative contexts. The paper proceeds to analyze a selected set of recent works that apply neural approaches to collaborative dialogue management, spotlighting prevailing trends in the field. This survey hopes to provide foundational background for future advancements in collaborative dialogue management, particularly as the dialogue systems community continues to embrace the potential of large language models.",,第1页.xls
477,Model-Free Model Reconciliation,2019,"Designing agents capable of explaining complex sequential decisions remains a significant open problem in human-AI interaction. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in developing approaches for generating such explanations for various decision-making paradigms. One such approach has been the idea of explanation as model-reconciliation. The framework hypothesizes that one of the common reasons for a user's confusion could be the mismatch between the user's model of the agent's task model and the model used by the agent to generate the decisions. While this is a general framework, most works that have been explicitly built on this explanatory philosophy have focused on classical planning settings where the model of user's knowledge is available in a declarative form. Our goal in this paper is to adapt the model reconciliation approach to a more general planning paradigm and discuss how such methods could be used when user models are no longer explicitly available. Specifically, we present a simple and easy to learn labeling model that can help an explainer decide what information could help achieve model reconciliation between the user and the agent with in the context of planning with MDPs.",,第1页.xls
478,Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Prostate Cancer Care: A Path to Enhanced Efficiency and Outcomes.,2024,"The landscape of prostate cancer care has rapidly evolved. We have transitioned from the use of conventional imaging, radical surgeries, and single-agent androgen deprivation therapy to an era of advanced imaging, precision diagnostics, genomics, and targeted treatment options. Concurrently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has dramatically transformed the paradigm for artificial intelligence (AI). This convergence of advancements in prostate cancer management and AI provides a compelling rationale to comprehensively review the current state of AI applications in prostate cancer care. Here, we review the advancements in AI-driven applications across the continuum of the journey of a patient with prostate cancer from early interception to survivorship care. We subsequently discuss the role of AI in prostate cancer drug discovery, clinical trials, and clinical practice guidelines. In the localized disease setting, deep learning models demonstrated impressive performance in detecting and grading prostate cancer using imaging and pathology data. For biochemically recurrent diseases, machine learning approaches are being tested for improved risk stratification and treatment decisions. In advanced prostate cancer, deep learning can potentially improve prognostication and assist in clinical decision making. Furthermore, LLMs are poised to revolutionize information summarization and extraction, clinical trial design and operations, drug development, evidence synthesis, and clinical practice guidelines. Synergistic integration of multimodal data integration and human-AI integration are emerging as a key strategy to unlock the full potential of AI in prostate cancer care.",,第1页.xls
479,Through the Cognitive Functions Lens - A Socio-technical Analysis of Predictive Maintenance,2021,"The effective use of artificial intelligence promises significant business value. Effective use, however, requires a thorough exploration of its strengths and weaknesses from different perspectives. Information systems research is particularly invested in the management and use of artificial intelligence in organizations. It has proposed the use of cognitive functions to guide this exploration. In this paper, we evaluate the usefulness of such a cognitive functions lens for a relatively mature application of artificial intelligence, predictive maintenance. Our evaluation is informed by the insights we collected from an embedded single-case study. We find that a cognitive functions lens can indeed be a useful tool to explore artificial intelligence. In particular, it can aid the allocation of tasks between human agents and artificial intelligence-based systems and the design of human-AI hybrids. It is particularly helpful for those who investigate the management of artificial intelligence.",,第1页.xls
480,Moral Uncertainty and Our Relationships with Unknown Minds,2023,"We are sometimes unsure of the moral status of our relationships with other entities. Recent case studies in this uncertainty include our relationships with artificial agents (robots, assistant AI, etc.), animals, and patients with locked-in syndrome. Do these entities have basic moral standing? Could they count as true friends or lovers? What should we do when we do not know the answer to these questions? An influential line of reasoning suggests that, in such cases of moral uncertainty, we need meta-moral decision rules that allow us to either minimize the risks of moral wrongdoing or improve the choice-worthiness of our actions. One particular argument adopted in this literature is the risk asymmetry argument, which claims that the risks associated with accepting or rejecting some moral facts may be sufficiently asymmetrical as to warrant favoring a particular practical resolution of this uncertainty. Focusing on the case study of artificial beings, this article argues that this is best understood as an ethical-epistemic challenge. The article argues that taking potential risk asymmetries seriously can help resolve disputes about the status of human -AI relationships, at least in practical terms (philosophical debates will, no doubt, continue); however, the resolution depends on a proper, empirically grounded assessment of the risks involved. Being skeptical about basic moral status, but more open to the possibility of meaningful relationships with such entities, may be the most sensible approach to take.",,第1页.xls
481,Training and Verbal Communications in Human-Autonomy Teaming Under Degraded Conditions,2020,"Verbal communication is important for coordination and performance in many team settings. However, the inclusion of autonomous artificial agents presents challenges to teamwork. This study sought to examine the effects of three different training approaches on team communication behaviors in human-autonomy teams (HATs) under normal and degraded conditions. Teams were split into three conditions prior to execution of missions in a remotely piloted aircraft system task environment: coordination training, calibration training, and control training. Analysis of text communications indicated that teams that received coordination training push information more frequently compared to teams that received control or calibration training, though this effect appeared to diminish over time. Teams in all three conditions pulled information equally, with a reduction in frequency over time. It was also found that teams that received coordination training were more likely to overcome failures attributed to the autonomous agent's cognitive capacities. This research suggests that coordination training in HATs may be effective at influencing team verbal behaviors, however the extent of this effect requires further examination.",,第1页.xls
482,Human-Computer Interaction and Explainability: Intersection and Terminology,2023,"Human-computer interaction (HCI) is generally considered the broader domain encompassing the study of the relationships between humans and types of technological artifacts or systems. Explainable AI (xAI) is involved in HCI to have humans better understand computers or AI systems which fosters, as a consequence, better interaction. The term explainability is sometimes used interchangeably with other closely related terms such as interpretability or understandability. The same can be said for the term interaction. It is a very broad way to describe the relationship between humans and technologies, which is why it is often replaced or completed by more precise terms like cooperation, collaboration, teaming, symbiosis, and integration. In the same vein, the technologies are represented by several terms like computer, machine, AI, agent, and robot. However, each of these terms (technologies and relationships) has its specificity and properties which need to be clearly defined. Currently, the definitions of these various terms are not well established in the literature, and their usage in various contexts is ambiguous. The goals of this paper are threefold: First, clarify the terminology in the HCI domain representing the technologies and their relationships with humans. A few concepts specific to xAI are also clarified. Second, highlight the role that xAI plays or can play in the HCI domain. Third, study the evolution and tendency of the usage of explainability and interpretability with the HCI terminology throughout the years and highlight the observations in the last three years.",,第1页.xls
483,Evaluating Human-AI Hybrid Conversational Systems with Chatbot Message Suggestions,2021,"AI chatbots can offer suggestions to help humans answer questions by reducing text entry effort and providing relevant knowledge for unfamiliar questions. We study whether chatbot suggestions can help people answer knowledge-demanding questions in a conversation and influence response quality and efficiency. We conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing user study and evaluated 20 hybrid system variants and a human-only baseline. The hybrid systems used four chatbots of varied response quality and differed in the number of suggestions and whether to preset the message box with top suggestions.Experimental results show that chatbot suggestions-even using poor-performing chatbots-have consistently improved response efficiency. Compared with the human-only setting, hybrid systems have reduced response time by 12%-35% and keystrokes by 33%-60%, and users have adopted a suggestion for the final response without any changes in 44%-68% of the cases. In contrast, crowd workers in the human-only setting typed most of the response texts and copied 5% of the answers from other sites.However, we also found that chatbot suggestions did not always help response quality. Specifically, in hybrid systems equipped with poor-performing chatbots, users responded with lower-quality answers than others in the human-only setting. It seems that users would not simply ignore poor suggestions and compose responses as they could without seeing the suggestions. Besides, presetting the message box has improved reply efficiency without hurting response quality. We did not find that showing more suggestions helps or hurts response quality or efficiency consistently. Our study reveals how and when AI chatbot suggestions can help people answer questions in hybrid conversational systems.",,第1页.xls
484,Bootstrapping Human-autonomy Collaborations by using Brain-Computer Interface of SSVEP for Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,2022,"Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) has become one of the emerging AI trends due to the advances in sophisticated machine design that allows closer cooperation with humans while performing moral, reasonable, and applicable tasks as humans' most exemplary assistants. Based on HAT's pursuing the collective goal and sharing the authority between humans and machines, our research aims at answering whether humans' brain-computer interface (BCI) helps achieve efficient collaborations of human with Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. How can it efficiently facilitate human-in-the-loop guidance to bootstrap the training of the agents? This study proposes a BCI-based system that interacts with RL agents as a human-in-the-loop teaming integration. The neural responses elicited by the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential in BCI facilitate the collaboration of learning agents with humans and accomplish this goal in a game simulation environment. The results of our proposed system, NeuroRL, show significant improvement by reducing the non-stationarity of exploitations and explorations in the RL agents. With BCI-assisted human-in-the-loop, the rewards can be optimized during the early investigations to achieve more efficient convergence in the training. The novel design proposed in this study can extend the development of the emerging HAT field and knowledge-based RL systems for various applications in dynamic environments.",,第1页.xls
485,Situated language learning via interactive narratives.,2021,"This paper provides a roadmap that explores the question of how to imbue learning agents with the ability to understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. We hypothesize that two key components in creating such agents are interactivity and environment grounding, shown to be vital parts of language learning in humans, and posit that interactive narratives should be the environments of choice for such training these agents. These games are simulations in which an agent interacts with the world through natural language-perceiving, acting upon, and talking to the world using textual descriptions, commands, and dialogue-and, as such, exist at the intersection of natural language processing, storytelling, and sequential decision making. We discuss the unique challenges a text games' puzzle-like structure combined with natural language state-and-action spaces provides: knowledge representation, common-sense reasoning, and exploration. Beyond the challenges described so far, progress in the realm of interactive narratives can be applied in adjacent problem domains. These applications provide interesting challenges of their own as well as extensions to those discussed so far. We describe three of them in detail: (1) evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems' common-sense understanding by automatically creating interactive narratives; (2) adapting abstract text-based policies to include other modalities, such as vision; and (3) enabling multi-agent and human-AI collaboration in shared, situated worlds.",,第1页.xls
486,Thorns and Algorithms: Navigating Generative AI Challenges Inspired by Giraffes and Acacias,2024,"The interplay between humans and Generative AI (Gen AI) draws an insightful parallel with the dynamic relationship between giraffes and acacias on the African Savannah. Just as giraffes navigate the acacia's thorny defenses to gain nourishment, humans engage with Gen AI, maneuvering through ethical and operational challenges to harness its benefits. This paper explores how, like young giraffes that are still mastering their environment, humans are in the early stages of adapting to and shaping Gen AI. It delves into the strategies humans are developing and refining to help mitigate risks such as bias, misinformation, and privacy breaches, that influence and shape Gen AI's evolution. While the giraffe-acacia analogy aptly frames human-AI relations, it contrasts nature's evolutionary perfection with the inherent flaws of human-made technology and the tendency of humans to misuse it, giving rise to many ethical dilemmas. Through the HHH framework we identify pathways to embed values of helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in AI development, fostering safety-aligned agents that resonate with human values. This narrative presents a cautiously optimistic view of human resilience and adaptability, illustrating our capacity to harness technologies and implement safeguards effectively, without succumbing to their perils. It emphasises a symbiotic relationship where humans and AI continually shape each other for mutual benefit.",,第1页.xls
487,A Gaze Data-Based Comparative Study to Build a Trustworthy Human-AI Collaboration in Crash Anticipation,2023,"Vehicles with a safety function for anticipating crashes in advance can enhance drivers' ability to avoid crashes. As dashboard cameras have become a low-cost sensor device accessible to almost every vehicle, deep neural networks for crash anticipation from a dashboard camera are receiving growing interest. However, drivers' trust in the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled safety function is built on the validation of its safety enhancement toward zero deaths. This paper is motivated to establish a method that uses gaze data and corresponding measures to evaluate human drivers' ability to anticipate crashes. A laboratory experiment is designed and performed, wherein a screenbased eye tracker collects the gaze data of six volunteers while watching 100 driving videos that include both normal and crash scenarios. Statistical analyses of the experimental data show that, on average, drivers can anticipate a crash up to 2.61 s before it occurs in this pilot study. The chance that drivers have successfully anticipated crashes before they occur is 92.8%. A state of the art AI model can anticipate crashes 1.02 s earlier than drivers on average. The study finds that crash-involving traffic agents in the driving videos can vary drivers' instant attention level, average attention level, and spatial attention distribution. This finding supports the development of a spatial-temporal attention mechanism for AI models to strengthen their ability to anticipate crashes. Results from the comparison also suggest the development of collaborative intelligence that keeps human-in-the-loop of AI models to further enhance the reliability of AI-enabled safety functions.",,第1页.xls
488,Design and Evaluation of a Conversational Agent for Facilitating Idea Generation in Organizational Innovation Processes,2022,"Large numbers of incomplete, unclear, and unspecific submissions on idea platforms hinder organizations to exploit the full potential of open innovation initiatives as idea selection is cumbersome. In a design science research project, we develop a design for a conversational agent (CA) based on artificial intelligence to facilitate contributors in generating elaborate ideas on idea platforms where human facilitation is not scalable. We derive prescriptive design knowledge in the form of design principles, instantiate, and evaluate the CA in two successive evaluation episodes. The design principles contribute to the current research stream on automated facilitation and can guide providers of idea platforms to enhance idea generation and subsequent idea selection processes.

They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of moral rewards in social dilemmas. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue (e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies.",,第1页.xls
490,Improving reinforcement learning with human assistance: an argument for human subject studies with HIPPO Gym,2023,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular machine learning paradigm for game playing, robotics control, and other sequential decision tasks. However, RL agents often have long learning times with high data requirements because they begin by acting randomly. In order to better learn in complex tasks, we argue that an external teacher can often significantly help the RL agent learn. OpenAI Gym is a common framework for RL research, including a large number of standard environments and agents, making RL research significantly more accessible. This article introduces our new open-source RL framework, the Human Input Parsing Platform for Openai Gym (HIPPO Gym), and the design decisions that went into its creation. The goal of this platform is to facilitate human-RL research, making human-in-the-loop RL more accessible, including learning from demonstrations, learning from feedback, or curriculum learning. In addition, all experiments can be conducted over the internet without any additional software needed on the client's computer, making experiments at scale significantly easier.",,第1页.xls
491,Do great minds think alike? Investigating Human-AI Complementarity in Question Answering with CAIMIRA,2024,"Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have led to claims of AI surpassing humans in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as textual understanding and reasoning. This work investigates these assertions by introducing CAIMIRA, a novel framework rooted in item response theory (IRT) that enables quantitative assessment and comparison of problem-solving abilities of question-answering (QA) agents: humans and AI systems. Through analysis of over 300,000 responses from ~70 AI systems and 155 humans across thousands of quiz questions, CAIMIRA uncovers distinct proficiency patterns in knowledge domains and reasoning skills. Humans outperform AI systems in knowledge-grounded abductive and conceptual reasoning, while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA show superior performance on targeted information retrieval and fact-based reasoning, particularly when information gaps are well-defined and addressable through pattern matching or data retrieval. These findings highlight the need for future QA tasks to focus on questions that challenge not only higher-order reasoning and scientific thinking, but also demand nuanced linguistic interpretation and cross-contextual knowledge application, helping advance AI developments that better emulate or complement human cognitive abilities in real-world problem-solving.",,第1页.xls

493,Building Trust Over Time in Human-Agent Relationships,2021,"This paper aims to understand how long-term trust and distrust develop between humans and agents (smart objects). We first conducted a qualitative study to explore key factors that lead to trust and distrust, how the human-agent trust journey develops, and what roles these trust-building factors play in the journey. This qualitative study involved an open-ended questionnaire completed by 621 participants and a five-day diary study with 60 participants that examined 499 human-object and human-agent relationships. Next, we conducted a mixed methods study with 146 participants to rate the importance of key factors identified through analysis of the data collected in the first study. We contribute to the HAI community by identifying eight factors accounting for participants' trust and distrust toward new objects, how these factors play different roles at different phases of the human-agent trust journey, and how important these factors are for both trust and distrust. We identified ebbs and flows in the human-agent trust journey over time, revealing time periods when trust is particularly vulnerable. We also found the most important factors for building trust and avoiding distrust did not entirely overlap. We discuss these findings and their implications for designing agents which need to foster trustful long-term relationships with humans.",,第1页.xls
494,Uncoupled learning of differential stackelberg equilibria with commitments [arXiv],2023,"A natural solution concept for many multiagent settings is the Stackelberg equilibrium, under which a leader agent selects a strategy that maximizes its own payoff assuming the follower chooses their best response to this strategy. Recent work has presented asymmetric learning updates that can be shown to converge to the differential Stackelberg equilibria of two-player differentiable games. These updates are coupled in the sense that the leader requires some information about the follower's payoff function. Such coupled learning rules cannot be applied to ad hoc interactive learning settings, and can be computationally impractical even in centralized training settings where the follower's payoffs are known. In this work, we present an uncoupled learning process under which each player's learning update only depends on their observations of the other's behavior. We prove that this process converges to a local Stackelberg equilibrium under similar conditions as previous coupled methods. We conclude with a discussion of the potential applications of our approach to human-AI cooperation and multi-agent reinforcement learning.",,第1页.xls
495,Human-Computer Interaction and Explainability: Intersection and Terminology,2023,"Human-computer interaction (HCI) is generally considered the broader domain encompassing the study of the relationships between humans and types of technological artifacts or systems. Explainable AI (xAI) is involved in HCI to have humans better understand computers or AI systems which fosters, as a consequence, better interaction. The term explainability is sometimes used interchangeably with other closely related terms such as interpretability or understandability. The same can be said for the term interaction. It is a very broad way to describe the relationship between humans and technologies, which is why it is often replaced or completed by more precise terms like cooperation, collaboration, teaming, symbiosis, and integration. In the same vein, the technologies are represented by several terms like computer, machine, AI, agent, and robot. However, each of these terms (technologies and relationships) has its specificity and properties which need to be clearly defined. Currently, the definitions of these various terms are not well established in the literature, and their usage in various contexts is ambiguous. The goals of this paper are threefold: First, clarify the terminology in the HCI domain representing the technologies and their relationships with humans. A few concepts specific to xAI are also clarified. Second, highlight the role that xAI plays or can play in the HCI domain. Third, study the evolution and tendency of the usage of explainability and interpretability with the HCI terminology throughout the years and highlight the observations in the last three years.",,第1页.xls
496,INVESTIGATING HOW ENGINEERS AND DESIGNERS COMMUNICATE DESIGN RATIONALE,2022,"Design rationale is the explicit documentation of the reasons behind decisions made in designing a product or system. Typically, design rationale is captured using a combination of written reports and oral presentations. Research shows that the structure and information used to communicate rationale significantly influence human behavior. To better understand the influence that communication of design rationale has on the design process, a detailed understanding of the information and techniques used to communicate design rationale needs to be studied. This research aims to identify how engineers and designers communicate this information in written form and the implications that their communication patterns have in engineering design. Eight hundred and forty-six pages of technical engineering design reports from 28 teams representing 116 individuals were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach and then compared across project types. The data were coded into categories using a schema we developed. The findings highlight the range of clarity that designers use in their rationales to support their design actions. Instead of clear, logical reasoning trends, designers often use techniques to fill gaps in design rationale through making assumptions, inserting oneself, or redirecting focus. The results suggest a need for improving design communication in engineering education and practice, perhaps through existing design reasoning frameworks or design rationale capturing tools. By capturing design rationale clearly between human designers, human-AI systems can leverage these findings to increase human confidence in and acceptance of a design agent's recommendations.",,第1页.xls

498,Off-Belief Learning [arXiv],2021,"The standard problem setting in Dec-POMDPs is self-play, where the goal is to find a set of policies that play optimally together. Policies learned through self-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and rely on multi-step counterfactual reasoning based on assumptions about other agents actions and thus fail when paired with humans or independently trained agents. In contrast, no current methods can learn optimal policies that are fully grounded, i.e., do not rely on counterfactual information from observing other agents actions. To address this, we present off-belief learning (OBL): at each time step OBL agents assume that all past actions were taken by a given, fixed policy (pi0), but that future actions will be taken by an optimal policy under these same assumptions. When pi0 is uniform random, OBL learns the optimal grounded policy. OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy from one level becomes the input to the next. This introduces counterfactual reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike independent RL which may converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy, making it more suitable for zero-shot coordination. OBL can be scaled to high-dimensional settings with afictitious transition mechanism and shows strong performance in both a simple toy-setting and the benchmark human-AI/zero-shot coordination problem Hanabi.",,第1页.xls
499,Off-Belief Learning,2021,"The standard problem setting in Dec-POMDPs is self-play, where the goal is to find a set of policies that play optimally together. Policies learned through self-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step reasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents' actions and thus fail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To address this, we present off-belief learning (OBL). At each timestep OBL agents follow a policy pi(1) that is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a given, fixed policy (pi(0)), but assuming that future actions will be taken by pi(1). When pi(0) is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy that does not rely on inferences based on other agents' behavior (an optimal grounded policy).

500,Perceptions of Linguistic Uncertainty by Language Models and Humans,2024,"Uncertainty expressions such as ``probably'' or ``highly unlikely'' are pervasive in human language. While prior work has established that there is population-level agreement in terms of how humans interpret these expressions, there has been little inquiry into the abilities of language models to interpret such expressions. In this paper, we investigate how language models map linguistic expressions of uncertainty to numerical responses. Our approach assesses whether language models can employ theory of mind in this setting: understanding the uncertainty of another agent about a particular statement, independently of the model's own certainty about that statement. We evaluate both humans and 10 popular language models on a task created to assess these abilities. Unexpectedly, we find that 8 out of 10 models are able to map uncertainty expressions to probabilistic responses in a human-like manner. However, we observe systematically different behavior depending on whether a statement is actually true or false. This sensitivity indicates that language models are substantially more susceptible to bias based on their prior knowledge (as compared to humans). These findings raise important questions and have broad implications for human-AI alignment and AI-AI communication.",,第1页.xls
501,Learning Agent-based Modeling with LLM Companions: Experiences of Novices and Experts Using ChatGPT & NetLogo Chat [arXiv],2024,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fundamentally change the way people engage in computer programming. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become ubiquitous in natural and social sciences and education, yet no prior studies have explored the potential of LLMs to assist it. We designed NetLogo Chat to support the learning and practice of NetLogo, a programming language for ABM. To understand how users perceive, use, and need LLM-based interfaces, we interviewed 30 participants from global academia, industry, and graduate schools. Experts reported more perceived benefits than novices and were more inclined to adopt LLMs in their workflow. We found significant differences between experts and novices in their perceptions, behaviors, and needs for human-AI collaboration. We surfaced a knowledge gap between experts and novices as a possible reason for the benefit gap. We identified guidance, personalization, and integration as major needs for LLM-based interfaces to support the programming of ABM.",,第1页.xls
502,Expectancy Violations and Discontinuance Behavior in Live-Streaming Commerce: Exploring Human Interactions with Virtual Streamers.,2024,"Virtual streamers, as a typical application of AI-enabled digital humans, are increasingly being utilized in live-streaming commerce due to technological advancements and industry innovations. Although virtual streamers present several benefits, there is potential for adverse effects when they do not align with consumer expectations. Drawing upon expectancy violations theory, this study developed a theoretical model to explore whether and how consumers' expectation violations during human-virtual streamer interactions affect consumers' discontinuance behavior. Through an online questionnaire survey of 307 Chinese consumers with prior experience interacting with virtual streamers, this study used a partial least squares structural equation model to analyze the research model. The empirical results indicated that professionalism expectation violation, empathy expectation violation, and responsiveness expectation violation positively influenced consumers' distrust and dissatisfaction, which subsequently led to discontinuance behavior. This study contributes to the literature on live-streaming commerce, human-AI interaction, and expectancy violation theory. Furthermore, the findings offer valuable insights for practitioners in the field of live-streaming commerce by enabling them to formulate preventive or remedial strategies to mitigate potential negative outcomes when implementing virtual streamers.",,第1页.xls
503,"LAMM: Language-Assisted Multi-Modal Instruction-Tuning Dataset, Framework, and Benchmark",2023,"Large language models have emerged as a promising approach towards achieving general-purpose AI agents. The thriving open-source LLM community has greatly accelerated the development of agents that support human-machine dialogue interaction through natural language processing. However, human interaction with the world extends beyond only text as a modality, and other modalities such as vision are also crucial. Recent works on multi-modal large language models, such as GPT-4V and Bard, have demonstrated their effectiveness in handling visual modalities. However, the transparency of these works is limited and insufficient to support academic research. To the best of our knowledge, we present one of the very first open-source endeavors in the field, LAMM, encompassing a Language-Assisted Multi-Modal instruction tuning dataset, framework, and benchmark. Our aim is to establish LAMM as a growing ecosystem for training and evaluating MLLMs, with a specific focus on facilitating AI agents capable of bridging the gap between ideas and execution, thereby enabling seamless human-AI interaction. Our main contribution is three-fold: 1) We present a comprehensive dataset and benchmark, which cover a wide range of vision tasks for 2D and 3D vision. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark. 2) We outline the detailed methodology of constructing multi-modal instruction tuning datasets and benchmarks for MLLMs, enabling rapid scaling and extension of MLLM research to diverse domains, tasks, and modalities. 3) We provide a primary but potential MLLM training framework optimized for modality extension. We also provide baseline models, comprehensive experimental observations, and analysis to accelerate future research. Our baseline model is trained within 24 A100 GPU hours, framework supports training with V100 and RTX3090 is available thanks to the open-source society.

504,Comparing Data from Chatbot and Web Surveys Effects of Platform and Conversational Style on Survey Response Quality,2019,"This study aims to explore the feasibility of a text-based virtual agent as a new survey method to overcome the web survey's common response quality problems, which are caused by respondents' inattention. To this end, we conducted a 2 (platform: web vs. chatbot) x 2 (conversational style: formal vs. casual) experiment. We used satisficing theory to compare the responses' data quality. We found that the participants in the chatbot survey, as compared to those in the web survey, were more likely to produce differentiated responses and were less likely to satisfice; the chatbot survey thus resulted in higher-quality data. Moreover, when a casual conversational style is used, the participants were less likely to satisfice-although such effects were only found in the chatbot condition. These results imply that conversational interactivity occurs when a chat interface is accompanied by messages with effective tone. Based on an analysis of the qualitative responses, we also showed that a chatbot could perform part of a human interviewer's role by applying effective communication strategies.",,第1页.xls
505,Safety-Aware Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning With Shared Control for Autonomous Driving,2024,"The learning from intervention (LfI) approach has been proven effective in improving the performance of RL algorithms; nevertheless, existing methodologies in this domain tend to operate under the assumption that human guidance is invariably devoid of risk, thereby possibly leading to oscillations or even divergence in RL training as a result of improper demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a safety-aware human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (SafeHIL-RL) approach to bridge the abovementioned gap. We first present a safety assessment module based on the artificial potential field (APF) model that incorporates dynamic information of the environment under the Frenet coordinate system, which we call the Frenet-based dynamic potential field (FDPF), for evaluating the real-time safety throughout the intervention process. Subsequently, we propose a curriculum guidance mechanism inspired by the pedagogical principle of whole-to-part patterns in human education. The curriculum guidance facilitates the RL agent's early acquisition of comprehensive global information through continual guidance while also allowing for fine-tuning local behavior through intermittent human guidance through a human-AI shared control strategy. Consequently, our approach enables a safe, robust, and efficient reinforcement learning process independent of the quality of guidance human participants provide. The proposed method is validated in two highway autonomous driving scenarios under highly dynamic traffic flows (https://github.com/OscarHuangWind/Safe-Human-in-the-Loop-RL). The experiments' results confirm the superiority and generalization capability of our approach when compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, as well as the effectiveness of the curriculum guidance.",,第1页.xls
506,A Unifying Bayesian Formulation of Measures of Interpretability in Human-AI [arXiv],2021,"Existing approaches for generating human-aware agent behaviors have considered different measures of interpretability in isolation. Further, these measures have been studied under differing assumptions, thus precluding the possibility of designing a single framework that captures these measures under the same assumptions. In this paper, we present a unifying Bayesian framework that models a human observer's evolving beliefs about an agent and thereby define the problem of Generalized Human-Aware Planning. We will show that the definitions of interpretability measures like explicability, legibility and predictability from the prior literature fall out as special cases of our general framework. Through this framework, we also bring a previously ignored fact to light that the human-robot interactions are in effect open-world problems, particularly as a result of modeling the human's beliefs over the agent. Since the human may not only hold beliefs unknown to the agent but may also form new hypotheses about the agent when presented with novel or unexpected behaviors.",,第1页.xls
507,Coaching Copilot: Blended Form of an LLM-Powered Chatbot and a Human Coach to Effectively Support Self-Reflection for Leadership Growth,2024,"Chatbots' role in fostering self-reflection is now widely recognized, especially in inducing users' behavior change. While the benefits of 24/7 availability, scalability, and consistent responses have been demonstrated in contexts such as healthcare and tutoring to help one form a new habit, their utilization in coaching necessitating deeper introspective dialogue to induce leadership growth remains unexplored. This paper explores the potential of such a chatbot powered by recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in collaboration with professional coaches in the field of executive coaching. Through a design workshop with them and two weeks of user study involving ten coach-client pairs, we explored the feasibility and nuances of integrating chatbots to complement human coaches. Our findings highlight the benefits of chatbots' ubiquity and reasoning capabilities enabled by LLMs while identifying their limitations and design necessities for effective collaboration between human coaches and chatbots. By doing so, thiswork contributes to the foundation for augmenting one's self-reflective process with prevalent conversational agents through the human-in-the-loop approach.",,第1页.xls

509,Artificial Intelligence for HCI: A Modern Approach,2020,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) share common roots and early work on conversational agents has laid the foundation for both fields. However, in subsequent decades the initial tight connection between the fields has become less pronounced. The recent rise of deep learning has revolutionized AI and has led to a raft of practical methods and tools that significantly impact areas outside of core-AI. In particular, modern AI techniques now power new ways for machines and humans to interact. Thus it is timely to investigate how modern AI can propel HCI research in new ways and how HCI research can help direct AI developments. This workshop offers a forum for researchers to discuss new opportunities that lie in bringing modern AI methods into HCI research, identifying important problems to investigate, showcasing computational and scientific methods that can be applied, and sharing datasets and tools that are already available or proposing those that should be further developed. The topics we are interested in including deep learning methods for understanding and modeling human behaviors and enabling new interaction modalities, hybrid intelligence that combine human and machine intelligence to solve difficult tasks, and tools and methods for interaction data curation and large-scale data-driven design. At the core of these topics, we want to start the conversation on how data-driven and data-centric approaches of modern AI can impact HCI.",,第1页.xls
510,Human-Agent Team Dynamics: A Review and Future Research Opportunities,2024,"Humans teaming with intelligent autonomous agents is becoming indispensable in work environments. However, human-agent teams pose significant challenges, as team dynamics are complex arising from the task and social aspects of human-agent interactions. To improve our understanding of human-agent team dynamics, in this article, we conduct a systematic literature review. Drawing on Mathieu et al.'s (2019) teamwork model developed for all-human teams, we map the landscape of research to human-agent team dynamics, including structural features, compositional features, mediating mechanisms, and the interplay of the above features and mechanisms. We reveal that the development of human-agent team dynamics is still nascent, with a particular focus on information sharing, trust development, agents' human likeness behaviors, shared cognitions, situation awareness, and function allocation. Gaps remain in many areas of team dynamics, such as team processes, adaptability, shared leadership, and team diversity. We offer various interdisciplinary pathways to advance research on human-agent teams.",,第1页.xls
511,dZiner: Rational Inverse Design of Materials with AI Agents,2024,"Recent breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence, fueled by scientific data, are revolutionizing the discovery of new materials. Despite the wealth of existing scientific literature, the availability of both structured experimental data and chemical domain knowledge that can be easily integrated into data-driven workflows is limited. The motivation to integrate this information, as well as additional context from first-principle calculations and physics-informed deep learning surrogate models, is to enable efficient exploration of the relevant chemical space and to predict structure-property relationships of new materials a priori. Ultimately, such a framework could replicate the expertise of human subject-matter experts. In this work, we present dZiner, a chemist AI agent, powered by large language models (LLMs), that discovers new compounds with desired properties via inverse design (property-to-structure). In specific, the agent leverages domain-specific insights from foundational scientific literature to propose new materials with enhanced chemical properties, iteratively evaluating them using relevant surrogate models in a rational design process, while accounting for design constraints. The model supports both closed-loop and human-in-the-loop feedback cycles, enabling human-AI collaboration in molecular design with real-time property inference, and uncertainty and chemical feasibility assessment. We demonstrate the flexibility of this agent by applying it to various materials target properties, including surfactants, ligand and drug candidates, and metal-organic frameworks. Our approach holds promise to both accelerate the discovery of new materials and enable the targeted design of materials with desired functionalities. The methodology is available as an open-source software on https://github.com/mehradans92/dZiner.",,第1页.xls
512,Design Intention Inference for Virtual Co-Design Agents,2020,"We address the challenge of inferring the design intentions of a human by an intelligent virtual agent that collaborates with the human. First, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network model that relates design intentions, objectives, and solutions during a human's exploration of a problem space. We then train the model on design behaviors generated by a search agent and use the model parameters to infer the design intentions in a test set of real human behaviors. We find that our model is able to infer the exact intentions across three objectives associated with a sequence of design outcomes 31.3% of the time. Inference accuracy is 50.9% for the top two predictions and 67.2% for the top three predictions. For any singular intention over an objective, the model's mean F1-score is 0.719. This provides a reasonable foundation for an intelligent virtual agent to infer design intentions purely from design outcomes toward establishing joint intentions with a human designer. These results also shed light on the potential benefits and pitfalls in using simulated data to train a model for human design intentions.",,第1页.xls
513,Pragmatic Communication with Embodied Agents,2023,"With the emergence of a new generation of embodied AI agents (e.g., cognitive robots), it has become increasingly important to empower these agents with the ability to learn and collaborate with humans through language communication. Despite recent advances, language communication in embodied AI still faces many challenges. Human language not only needs to ground to agents' perception and action but also needs to facilitate collaboration between humans and agents. To address these challenges, I will introduce several efforts in my lab that study pragmatic communication with embodied agents. I will talk about how language use is shaped by shared experience and knowledge (i.e., common ground) and how collaborative effort is important to mediate perceptual differences and handle exceptions. I will discuss task learning by following language instructions and highlight the need for neurosymbolic representations for situation awareness and transparency. I will further present explicit modeling of partners' goals, beliefs, and abilities (i.e., theory of mind) and discuss its role in language communication for situated collaborative tasks.",,第1页.xls
514,Situated Language Learning via Interactive Narratives [arXiv],2021,"This paper provides a roadmap that explores the question of how to imbue learning agents with the ability to understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. We hypothesize that two key components in creating such agents are interactivity and environment grounding, shown to be vital parts of language learning in humans, and posit that interactive narratives should be the environments of choice for such training these agents. These games are simulations in which an agent interacts with the world through natural language -- perceiving, acting upon, and talking to the world using textual descriptions, commands, and dialogue -- and as such exist at the intersection of natural language processing, storytelling, and sequential decision making. We discuss the unique challenges a text games' puzzle-like structure combined with natural language state-and-action spaces provides: knowledge representation, commonsense reasoning, and exploration. Beyond the challenges described so far, progress in the realm of interactive narratives can be applied in adjacent problem domains. These applications provide interesting challenges of their own as well as extensions to those discussed so far. We describe three of them in detail: (1) evaluating AI system's commonsense understanding by automatically creating interactive narratives; (2) adapting abstract text-based policies to include other modalities such as vision; and (3) enabling multi-agent and human-AI collaboration in shared, situated worlds.",,第1页.xls
515,Defining a Human-Machine Teaming Model for AI-Powered Human-Centered Machine Translation Agent by Learning from Human-Human Group Discussion: Dialog Categories and Dialog Moves,2020,"The vision of human-machine symbiosis is that a human will work closely and harmoniously with the machine. We study interactions among human translators to help define potential Human-Machine Interface (HCI) and Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) models for human-centered machine translation systems. The role of the machine, in this context, is to be an AI-based agent serving as a real-time partner. The questions we ask are that if we have such an agent, what are the main functions of the agent, how does the agent interact with a human translator in a way where they can work symbiotically as partners, what human deficiencies can be augmented by an AI-based agent and how, and what kind of human behaviors should the AI-based agent mimic. We used a data set collected from an online translation study group composed of certified and highly experienced translators (both English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English), and altogether we analyzed several hundred dialogs between these translators related to the translation results. Each dialog always started with an initial comment and would focus on one of many possible categories. The first question we asked was which categories were discussed more frequently than the others, and why. At both the word level and above the word level, three dominating categories were found: source misunderstanding, target expression problem, and confirmation on good translation. In addition, we found that the more than half of the dialogs focused only at the word-level. The second question we asked was whether a discussion (represented by a dialog) was effective or not. What we found was that the most common pattern was the one associated with simple but effective dialog, while constructive dialogs were conversely very infrequent. Based on these findings, we derive the HCI/HMT design implications for an AI-based translation agent: provide better capability beyond the word/phrase level to complement human deficiencies; focus on building algorithms to support better source understanding and target expression delivery; provide quick information search and retrieval to support real-time interaction; provide confirmation to a human partner's good translation with reasons and explanations; provide help regarding source understanding and target language delivery based on the native language of the human partner; act in the role of a lead translator who has better domain and linguistic knowledge, superior cognitive capability, and unique analytic perspectives to complement human deficiency; and perform in-depth constructive dialogs with human partners by stimulating thought.",,第1页.xls

In the context of designing a tool for Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) in aircraft maintenance planning, this case study addresses (1) the use of Playful Probing approach to obtain insights that allow understanding of how to design for interaction with ML algorithms, (2) the integration of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for Human-AI collaboration in maintenance planning and (3) the visualisation of CBM indicators. Using a design science research approach, we designed a Playful Probe protocol and materials, and evaluated results by running a participatory design workshop. Our main contribution is to show how to elicit ideas for integration of maintenance planning practices with ML estimation tools and the RL agent. Through a participatory design workshop with participants' observation, in which they played with CBM artefacts, Playful Probes favour the elicitation of user interaction requirements with the RL planning agent to aid the planner to obtain a reliable maintenance plan and turn possible to understand how to represent CBM indicators and visualise them through a trajectory prediction.",,第1页.xls
520,Battlespace: Using AI to Understand Friendly vs. Hostile Decision Dynamics in MDO,2021,"Future Multi Domain Operation (MDO) wargaming will rely on Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms to aid and accelerate complex Command and Control decision-making. This requires an interdisciplinary effort to develop new algorithms that can operate in dynamic environments with changing rules, uncertainty, individual biases, changing cognitive states, as well as the capability to rapidly mitigate unexpected hostile capabilities and exploit friendly technological capabilities. Building on recent advancements in AI/ML algorithms, we believe that new algorithms for learning, reasoning under uncertainty, game theory with three or more players, and interpretable AI can be developed to aid in complex MDO decision-making. To achieve these goals, we developed a new flexible MDO warfighter machine interface game, Battlespace, to investigate and understand how human decision-making principles can be leveraged by and synergized with AI. We conducted several experiments with human vs. random players operating in a fixed environment with fixed rules, where the overall goal of the human players was to collaborate to either capture the opponents' flags or eliminate all of their units. Then, we analyzed the evolution of the games and identified key features that characterized the human players' strategies and their overall goal. We then followed a Bayesian approach to model the human strategies and developed heuristic strategies for a simple AI agent. Preliminary analysis revealed that following the human agents' strategy in the capture the flag games produced the greatest winning percentage and may be useful for gauging the value of intermediate game states for developing the coordinated action planning of reinforcement learning algorithms.",,第1页.xls
521,Conversational Artificial Intelligence in Psychotherapy: A New Therapeutic Tool or Agent?,2023,"Conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) presents many opportunities in the psychotherapeutic landscape-such as therapeutic support for people with mental health problems and without access to care. The adoption of CAI poses many risks that need in-depth ethical scrutiny. The objective of this paper is to complement current research on the ethics of AI for mental health by proposing a holistic, ethical, and epistemic analysis of CAI adoption. First, we focus on the question of whether CAI is rather a tool or an agent. This question serves as a framework for the subsequent ethical analysis of CAI focusing on topics of (self-) knowledge, (self-)understanding, and relationships. Second, we propose further conceptual and ethical analysis regarding human-AI interaction and argue that CAI cannot be considered as an equal partner in a conversation as is the case with a human therapist. Instead, CAI's role in a conversation should be restricted to specific functions.",,第1页.xls
522,AutoWebGLM: Bootstrap And Reinforce A Large Language Model-based Web Navigating Agent,2024,"Large language models (LLMs) have fueled many intelligent agent tasks, such as web navigation - but most existing agents perform far from satisfying in real-world webpages due to three factors: (1) the versatility of actions on webpages, (2) HTML text exceeding model processing capacity, and (3) the complexity of decision-making due to the open-domain nature of web. In light of the challenge, we develop AutoWebGLM, a GPT-4-outperforming automated web navigation agent built upon ChatGLM3-6B. Inspired by human browsing patterns, we design an HTML simplification algorithm to represent webpages, preserving vital information succinctly. We employ a hybrid human-AI method to build web browsing data for curriculum training. Then, we bootstrap the model by reinforcement learning and rejection sampling to further facilitate webpage comprehension, browser operations, and efficient task decomposition by itself. For testing, we establish a bilingual benchmark - AutoWebBench - for real-world web browsing tasks. We evaluate AutoWebGLM across diverse web navigation benchmarks, revealing its improvements but also underlying challenges to tackle real environments.

523,Gaze-informed Signatures of Trust and Collaboration in Human-Autonomy Teams,2024,"In the evolving landscape of human-autonomy teaming (HAT), fostering effective collaboration and trust between human and autonomous agents is increasingly important. To explore this, we used the game Overcooked AI to create dynamic teaming scenarios featuring varying agent behaviors (clumsy, rigid, adaptive) and environmental complexities (low, medium, high). Our objectives were to assess the performance of adaptive AI agents designed with hierarchical reinforcement learning for better teamwork and measure eye tracking signals related to changes in trust and collaboration. The results indicate that the adaptive agent was more effective in managing teaming and creating an equitable task distribution across environments compared to the other agents. Working with the adaptive agent resulted in better coordination, reduced collisions, more balanced task contributions, and higher trust ratings. Reduced gaze allocation, across all agents, was associated with higher trust levels, while blink count, scan path length, agent revisits and trust were predictive of the humans contribution to the team. Notably, fixation revisits on the agent increased with environmental complexity and decreased with agent versatility, offering a unique metric for measuring teammate performance monitoring. These findings underscore the importance of designing autonomous teammates that not only excel in task performance but also enhance teamwork by being more predictable and reducing the cognitive load on human team members. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of eye-tracking as an unobtrusive measure for evaluating and improving human-autonomy teams, suggesting eye gaze could be used by agents to dynamically adapt their behaviors.",,第1页.xls
524,Learning Agent-based Modeling with LLM Companions: Experiences of Novices and Experts Using ChatGPT & NetLogo Chat,2024,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fundamentally change the way people engage in computer programming. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become ubiquitous in natural and social sciences and education, yet no prior studies have explored the potential of LLMs to assist it. We designed NetLogo Chat to support the learning and practice of NetLogo, a programming language for ABM. To understand how users perceive, use, and need LLM-based interfaces, we interviewed 30 participants from global academia, industry, and graduate schools. Experts reported more perceived benefits than novices and were more inclined to adopt LLMs in their workflow. We found significant differences between experts and novices in their perceptions, behaviors, and needs for human-AI collaboration. We surfaced a knowledge gap between experts and novices as a possible reason for the benefit gap. We identified guidance, personalization, and integration as major needs for LLM-based interfaces to support the programming of ABM.",,第1页.xls

526,Understanding key drivers affecting students' use of artificial intelligence-based voice assistants,2022,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based voice assistants have become an essential part of our daily lives. Yet, little is known concerning what motivates students to use them in educational activities. Therefore, this research develops a theoretical model by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM) with subjective norm, enjoyment, facilitating conditions, trust, and security to examine students' use of AI-based voice assistants for instructional purposes. The developed model was then validated based on data collected from 300 university students using the PLS-SEM technique. The results supported the role of enjoyment, trust, and perceived ease of use (PEOU) in affecting the perceived usefulness (PU) of voice assistants. The empirical results also showed that facilitating conditions and trust in technology strongly influence the PEOU. Contrary to the extant literature, the results indicated that subjective norm, facilitating conditions, and security did not impact PU. Similarly, subjective norm and enjoyment did not affect PEOU. This research is believed to add a holistic understanding of the key drivers affecting students' use of voice assistants for educational purposes. It offers several theoretical contributions and practical implications on how to successfully employ these assistants.",,第1页.xls
527,Interactive Speculative Planning: Enhance Agent Efficiency through Co-design of System and User Interface,2024,"Agents, as user-centric tools, are increasingly deployed for human task delegation, assisting with a broad spectrum of requests by generating thoughts, engaging with user proxies, and producing action plans. However, agents based on large language models (LLMs) often face substantial planning latency due to two primary factors: the efficiency limitations of the underlying LLMs due to their large size and high demand, and the structural complexity of the agents due to the extensive generation of intermediate thoughts to produce the final output. Given that inefficiency in service provision can undermine the value of automation for users, this paper presents a human-centered efficient agent planning method -- Interactive Speculative Planning -- aiming at enhancing the efficiency of agent planning through both system design and human-AI interaction. Our approach advocates for the co-design of the agent system and user interface, underscoring the importance of an agent system that can fluidly manage user interactions and interruptions. By integrating human interruptions as a fundamental component of the system, we not only make it more user-centric but also expedite the entire process by leveraging human-in-the-loop interactions to provide accurate intermediate steps. Code and data will be released.",,第1页.xls
528,"Evaluation of Conversational Agents: Understanding Culture, Context and Environment in Emotion Detection",2022,"Valuable decisions and highly prioritized analysis now depend on applications such as facial biometrics, social media photo tagging, and human robots interactions. However, the ability to successfully deploy such applications is based on their efficiencies on tested use cases taking into consideration possible edge cases. Over the years, lots of generalized solutions have been implemented to mimic human emotions including sarcasm. However, factors such as geographical location or cultural difference have not been explored fully amidst its relevance in resolving ethical issues and improving conversational AI (Artificial Intelligence). In this paper, we seek to address the potential challenges in the usage of conversational AI within Black African society. We develop an emotion prediction model with accuracies ranging between 85% and 96%. Our model combines both speech and image data to detect the seven basic emotions with a focus on also identifying sarcasm. It uses 3-layers of the Convolutional Neural Network in addition to a new Audio-Frame Mean Expression (AFME) algorithm and focuses on model pre-processing and post-processing stages. In the end, our proposed solution contributes to maintaining the credibility of an emotion recognition system in conversational AIs.",,第1页.xls

530,Law Informs Code: A Legal Informatics Approach to Aligning Artificial Intelligence with Humans [arXiv],2022,"We are currently unable to specify human goals and societal values in a way that reliably directs AI behavior. Law is a computational engine that converts opaque human values into legible and enforceable directives. Law Informs Code is the research agenda attempting to capture that complex computational process of human law, and embed it in AI. Similar to how parties to a legal contract cannot foresee every potential contingency of their future relationship, and legislators cannot predict all the circumstances under which their proposed bills will be applied, we cannot ex ante specify rules that provably direct good AI behavior. Legal theory and practice have developed arrays of tools to address these specification problems. For instance, legal standards allow humans to develop shared understandings and adapt them to novel situations. In contrast to more prosaic uses of the law (e.g., as a deterrent of bad behavior through the threat of sanction), leveraged as an expression of how humans communicate their goals, and what society values, Law Informs Code. We describe how the data generated by legal processes and the theoretical constructs and practices of law (methods of law-making, statutory interpretation, contract drafting, applications of standards, legal reasoning, etc.) can facilitate the robust specification of inherently vague human goals for AI. This helps with human-AI alignment and the local usefulness of AI. Toward society-AI alignment, we present a framework for understanding law as the applied philosophy of multi-agent alignment. Although law is partly a reflection of historically contingent political power - and thus not a perfect aggregation of citizen preferences - if properly parsed, its distillation offers a legitimate computational comprehension of societal values.",,第1页.xls

A study of an LLM predecessor illuminates possibilities. With rapid change comes rising uncertainty. Not all history is relevant, but unchanging human nature abides. Some digital dreams become digital nightmares. Social media can deliver disinformation, malware, negative self-image, and polarization that undermines communities. Generative AI provides value but raises employment and career questions, education challenges, and empowers bad actors. We benefit from understanding the forces, the trajectories that brought us here, and how unanticipated consequences arose. Past events that shaped the present have become evident.",,第1页.xls
532,"A Survey on Context-Aware Multi-Agent Systems: Techniques, Challenges and Future Directions [arXiv]",2024,"Research interest in autonomous agents is on the rise as an emerging topic. The notable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the considerable potential to attain human-like intelligence in autonomous agents. However, the challenge lies in enabling these agents to learn, reason, and navigate uncertainties in dynamic environments. Context awareness emerges as a pivotal element in fortifying multi-agent systems when dealing with dynamic situations. Despite existing research focusing on both context-aware systems and multi-agent systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys outlining techniques for integrating context-aware systems with multi-agent systems. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art context-aware multi-agent systems. First, we outline the properties of both context-aware systems and multi-agent systems that facilitate integration between these systems. Subsequently, we propose a general process for context-aware systems, with each phase of the process encompassing diverse approaches drawn from various application domains such as collision avoidance in autonomous driving, disaster relief management, utility management, supply chain management, human-AI interaction, and others. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges of context-aware multi-agent systems and provide future research directions in this field.",,第1页.xls

This paper proposes basic guidelines for animated agents evaluation based on concepts provided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

534,Co-constructing knowledge with generative AI tools: Reflections from a CSCL perspective,2023,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have received great attention from researchers, the media, and the public. They are gladly and frequently used for text production by many people. These tools have undeniable strengths but also weaknesses that must be addressed. In this squib we ask to what extent these tools can be employed by users for individual learning as well as for knowledge construction to spark a collective endeavor of developing new insights. We take a social, collective notion of knowledge as a basis and argue that users need to establish a dialog that goes beyond knowledge telling (simply writing what one knows) and stimulates knowledge transformation (converting knowledge into complex relational argumentation structures). Generative AI tools do not have any conceptual knowledge or conscious understanding, as they only use word transitions and rely on probabilities of word classes. We suggest, however, that argumentative dialogs among humans and AI tools can be achieved with appropriate prompts, where emergent processes of joint knowledge construction can take place. Based on this assumption, we inquire into the human and into the AI parts of communication and text production. For our line of argument, we borrow from research on individual and collaborative writing, group cognition, and the co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. We outline future CSCL research paths that might take the human-AI co-construction of knowledge into account in terms of terminology, theory, and methodology.",,第1页.xls

In this larger setting for metaphor, key aspects of computation for metaphors, analogy and agents are highlighted.",,第1页.xls
536,Resveratrol antagonizes EGFR-dependent Erk1/2 activation in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells with associated isozyme-selective PKCα inhibition,2004,"The development of androgen-independent prostate cancer (AI PrCa) involves constitutive Erk1/2 activation sustained by the epidermal growth factor/transforming growth factor-alpha/EGF receptor (EGF/TGFalpha/EGFR) axis and other trophic signaling mechanisms in neoplastic human prostate epithelial cells in vivo. In this report, we show that growth-inhibitory concentrations of the dietary phytochemical resveratrol suppress EGFR-dependent Erk1/2 activation pathways stimulated by EGF and phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate, TPA) in human AI PrCa PC-3 cells in vitro. Because protein kinase C (PKC) is the major cellular receptor for phorbol esters and taking into consideration that resveratrol is PKC-inhibitory, we investigated resveratrol effects on cellular PKC isozymes associated with the suppression of TPA-induced Erk1/2 activation. The PKC isozyme composition of PC-3 cells was defined by Western analysis of the cell lysate with a comprehensive set of isozyme-selective PKC Ab's. PC-3 cells expressed PKCalpha, epsilon, zeta, iota, and PKD (PKCmu), as did another human AI PrCa cell line of distinct genetic origin, DU145. The effects of resveratrol on TPA-induced PKC isozyme activation were defined by monitoring PKC isozyme translocation and autophosphorylation. Under conditions where resveratrol suppressed TPA-induced Erk1/2 activation, the phytochemical produced isozyme-selective interference with TPA-induced translocation of cytosolic PKCalpha to the membrane/cytoskeleton and selectively diminished the amount of autophosphorylated PKCalpha in the membrane/cytoskeleton of the TPA-treated cells. These results demonstrate that resveratrol abrogation of a PKC-mediated Erk1/2 activation response in PC-3 cells correlates with isozyme-selective PKCalpha inhibition. The results provide evidence that resveratrol may have value as an adjuvant cancer therapeutic in advanced prostate cancer.",,第1页.xls

However, utilizing large language models for sales in live-streaming commerce faces the challenge of low interaction quality. In this paper, we introduce ChatLsc, a Vtuber designed for live-streaming commerce. Drawing inspiration from leadership behaviors in human societies, we assign different identities and capabilities to agents and encourage their collaboration. In the preparation phase, leaders plan and prepare for the upcoming broadcast based on initial information received from humans. During the live streaming phase, ChatLsc perceives audience comments in real-time through the collaboration of observers, creators, broadcasters, and leaders, combining these with past live streaming activities to generate visual and auditory feedback for the audience. We demonstrate how to use LLMs to interact with audiences in real-time live-streaming commerce, revealing the potential of LLMs for new commercial applications.",,第1页.xls
538,AVM-BTB: Adaptive and Virtualized Multi-level Branch Target Buffer,2024,"Branch Target Buffer (BTB) plays an important role in modern processors. It is used to identify branches in the instruction stream and predict branch targets. The accuracy of BTB is highly impacted by BTB capacity. However, expanding BTB capacity using traditional methods requires valuable on-chip SRAM. Both timing and area restriction make these approaches unsustainable. Moreover, these methods overlook the different demands of various applications, leading to increased power consumption and resource waste in some cases.To address this problem, we propose AVM-BTB. The key observations behind AVM-BTB come from three aspects: 1) BTB requirements vary over different applications and even over different running stages of the same application. 2) Micro-operation Cache (Uop Cache) and ICache exhibit inefficiency when confronted with instruction footprints that greatly exceed their capacity. 3) In specific scenarios of frontend overload, reducing cache capacity and increasing BTB size can effectively mitigate expensive branch prediction errors. Simultaneously, the implementation of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) can offset the limitations in cache capacity to some extent. These observations reveal the feasibility of dynamically borrowing cache capacity as temporary BTB and returning these BTB to cache when they are not needed, further resulting in an adaptive and virtualized multi-level BTB scheme. However, such a BTB structure is non-trivial. In this work, from the perspective of instructions, the cache hierarchy stores instruction data, while the BTB stores metadata used for branch prediction and instruction prefetch. Targeting high performance, AVM-BTB maintains a dynamic balance between data and metadata by monitoring the BTB error rate and effective accesses. Evaluation with 1253 traces shows that AVM-BTB is suitable for both front-end-bound and front-end-friendly scenarios, without consuming additional SRAM and with reasonable implementation efforts. Compared to baseline, AVM-BTB delivers an average performance boost of 18.22% and a power consumption reduction of 2.77%. It also outperforms the five state-of-the-art solutions by 6.26%-18.26% on average in terms of IPC.",,第1页.xls

Furthermore, AI techniques applicable to mimicking certain features of a specific person (e.g., facial expression, voice, motion) are becoming more sophisticated. Although the HCI community has explored how to design or develop AI agents mimicking a real person, limited studies on mimicking someones text-based behavior shown in the instant messaging exist.

In this paper, we investigate Agency as a potentially desirable function of dialogue agents, and how it can be measured and controlled. We build upon the social-cognitive theory of Bandura (2001) to develop a framework of features through which Agency is expressed in dialogue -- indicating what you intend to do (Intentionality), motivating your intentions (Motivation), having self-belief in intentions (Self-Efficacy), and being able to self-adjust (Self-Regulation). We collect and release a new dataset of 83 human-human collaborative interior design conversations containing 908 conversational snippets annotated for Agency features. Using this dataset, we explore methods for measuring and controlling Agency in dialogue systems. Automatic and human evaluation show that although a baseline GPT-3 model can express Intentionality, models that explicitly manifest features associated with high Motivation, Self-Efficacy, and Self-Regulation are better perceived as being highly agentive. This work has implications for the development of dialogue systems with varying degrees of Agency in collaborative tasks.",,第1页.xls

Yet we know little about the designers' perceptions and practices of collaborating with generative AI as a co-creative agent within the context of multi-stakeholder participation. To investigate these questions, we took the domain of avatar design as an example and conducted a qualitative interview study with 21 expert avatar designers who have got different levels of experience and expertise in utilizing generative AI tools in their design workflow. We found that designers not only would fall in a dilemma when deciding whether to consider AI as a co-creative agent according to different stakeholders' interests, but they also face many challenges in effectively co-creating with the current systems, including challenges in consistently adjusting AI outputs and getting design inspiration within the iterative generation process, etc. Based on our findings, we concluded both the epistemological and creative patterns of collaborating with generative AI and high-lighted several design opportunities from both technical and ethical perspectives to better support future designer-AI co-creation.",,第1页.xls
545,Interaction mediation for meaningful human control over highly automated vehicles,2023,"The current advancement of technology with not only physical, but increasing cognitive functions widely coined as Artificial Intelligence (AI) leads to multiple situations where humans willingly or unwillingly accept the decisions of algorithms and Neural Network (NN) Models resulting in humans being decreasingly involved in the decision-making process. Human-machine cooperation and Human Autonomy Teaming (HAT) are an answer to this problem, joining the best of both sides into joined cognitive systems. Meaningful Human Control (MHC) is the concept of ensuring that humans have enough influence on the outcome of actions in HAT and hence stay morally responsible and legally accountable for their actions.

The study was conducted with non-expert users as well as with health experts and was in part supported by the development of prototypes. It focuses on human-centric aspects, in particular user motivations, as well as on expectations and perceptions regarding the role and interaction behavior of a digital companion. Based on the results of the study, a framework for person tailoring the agent's roles and behaviors, and argumentation schemes are proposed. The results indicate that the extent to which a digital companion argumentatively challenges or supports a user's attitudes and chosen behavior and how assertive and provocative the companion is may have a substantial and individualized effect on user acceptance, as well as on the effects of interacting with the digital companion. More broadly, the results shed some initial light on the perception of users and domain experts of soft, meta-level aspects of argumentative dialogue, indicating potential for future research.",,第1页.xls
547,Measuring Causal Responsibility in Multi-Agent Spatial Interactions with Feasible Action-Space Reduction [arXiv],2023,"Modelling causal responsibility in multi-agent spatial interactions is crucial for safety and efficiency of interactions of humans with autonomous agents. However, current formal metrics and models of responsibility either lack grounding in ethical and philosophical concepts of responsibility, or cannot be applied to spatial interactions. In this work we propose a metric of causal responsibility which is tailored to multi-agent spatial interactions, for instance interactions in traffic. In such interactions, a given agent can, by reducing another agent's feasible action space, influence the latter. Therefore, we propose feasible action space reduction (FeAR) as a metric for causal responsibility among agents. Specifically, we look at ex-post causal responsibility for simultaneous actions. We propose the use of Moves de Rigueur - a consistent set of prescribed actions for agents - to model the effect of norms on responsibility allocation. We apply the metric in a grid world simulation for spatial interactions and show how the actions, contexts, and norms affect the causal responsibility ascribed to agents. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this metric in complex multi-agent interactions. We argue that the FeAR metric is a step towards an interdisciplinary framework for quantifying responsibility that is needed to ensure safety and meaningful human control in human-AI systems.",,第1页.xls
548,How Visualising Emotions Affects Interpersonal Trust and Task Collaboration in a Shared Virtual Space,2023,"Emotion is dynamic. Changes in emotion can be hard to process during face-to-face interaction, yet transferring them into a shared virtual space becomes more challenging. This research first explores nine visual representations to amplify emotions in a virtual space, leading to a bi-directional emotion-sharing system (FeelMoji i/o). The second study investigates the effect of explicit emotion-sharing in interpersonal trust and task collaboration through three conditions - verbal only, verbal+positive visual, and verbal+honest visual using FeelMoji through the proposal of a framework of four factors (usability, integrity, behaviour, and collaboration). The results indicate that FeelMoji yields frequent emotion consensus as task milestones and positive interdependent behaviours between collaborators, which help develop conversations, affirm decision-making, and build familiarity and trust between strangers. Moreover, we discuss how our study can inspire future investigation in human-AI agent behaviours and large-scale multi-user virtual environments.",,第1页.xls
549,Behavioral Cues of Humanness in Complex Environments: How People Engage With Human and Artificially Intelligent Agents in a Multiplayer Videogame.,2020,"The development of AI that can socially engage with humans is exciting to imagine, but such advanced algorithms might prove harmful if people are no longer able to detect when they are interacting with non-humans in online environments. Because we cannot fully predict how socially intelligent AI will be applied, it is important to conduct research into how sensitive humans are to behaviors of humans compared to those produced by AI. This paper presents results from a behavioral Turing Test, in which participants interacted with a human, or a simple or social AI within a complex videogame environment. Participants (66 total) played an open world, interactive videogame with one of these co-players and were instructed that they could interact non-verbally however they desired for 30 min, after which time they would indicate their beliefs about the agent, including three Likert measures of how much participants trusted and liked the co-player, the extent to which they perceived them as a real person, and an interview about the overall perception and what cues participants used to determine humanness. T-tests, Analysis of Variance and Tukey's HSD was used to analyze quantitative data, and Cohen's Kappa and chi2 was used to analyze interview data. Our results suggest that it was difficult for participants to distinguish between humans and the social AI on the basis of behavior. An analysis of in-game behaviors, survey data and qualitative responses suggest that participants associated engagement in social interactions with humanness within the game.",,第1页.xls
550,Artificial Intelligence for HCI: A Modern Approach,2020,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) share common roots and early work on conversational agents has laid the foundation for both fields. However, in subsequent decades the initial tight connection between the fields has become less pronounced. The recent rise of deep learning has revolutionized AI and has led to a raft of practical methods and tools that significantly impact areas outside of core-AI. In particular, modern AI techniques now power new ways for machines and humans to interact. Thus it is timely to investigate how modern AI can propel HCI research in new ways and how HCI research can help direct AI developments. This workshop offers a forum for researchers to discuss new opportunities that lie in bringing modern AI methods into HCI research, identifying important problems to investigate, showcasing computational and scientific methods that can be applied, and sharing datasets and tools that are already available or proposing those that should be further developed. The topics we are interested in including deep learning methods for understanding and modeling human behaviors and enabling new interaction modalities, hybrid intelligence that combine human and machine intelligence to solve difficult tasks, and tools and methods for interaction data curation and large-scale data-driven design. At the core of these topics, we want to start the conversation on how data-driven and data-centric approaches of modern AI can impact HCI.",,第1页.xls
551,Decoding the agility of artificial intelligence- assisted human design teams,2022,"Although necessary for complex problem solving, such as engineering design, team agility is often difficult to achieve in practice. The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) affords unique opportunities for supporting team problem solving. While integrating assistive AI agents into human teams has at times improved team performance, it is still unclear if, how, and why AI affects team agility. A large-scale human experiment answers these questions, revealing that, with appropriately interfaced AIs, AI-assisted human teams enjoy improved coordination and communications, leading to better performance and adaptations to team disruptions, while devoting more effort to information handling and exploring the solution space more broadly. In sum, working with AI enables human team members to think more and act less. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

553,"Prestige Questions, Online Agents, and Gender-Driven Differences in Disclosure",2017,"This work considers the possibility of using virtual agents to encourage disclosure for sensitive information. In particular, this research used prestige questions, which asked participants to disclose information relevant to their socioeconomic status, such as credit limit, as well as university attendance, and mortgage or rent payments they could afford. We explored the potential for agents to enhance disclosure compared to conventional web-forms, due to their ability to serve as relational agents by creating rapport. To consider this possibility, agents were framed as artificially intelligent versus avatars controlled by a real human, and we compared these conditions to a version of the financial questionnaire with no agent. In this way, both the perceived agency of the agent and its ability to generate rapport were tested. Additionally, we examined the differences in disclosure between men and women in these conditions. Analyses reveled that agents (either AI- or human-framed) evoked greater disclosure compared to the no agent condition. However, there was some evidence that human-framed agents evoked greater lying. Thus, users in general responded more socially to the presence of a human- or AI-framed agent, and the benefits and costs of this approach were made apparent. The results are discussed in terms of rapport and anonymity.",,第1页.xls
554,Enhancing Team Diversity with Generative AI: A Novel Project Management Framework,2024,"The proliferation of homogeneous teams in academic research projects limits the diversity necessary for innovative outcomes. This paper presents a framework that applies generative AI (GenAI) to project management, aiming to enhance team diversity by introducing GenAI agents modelled after a range of successful team member roles and personalities. These agents are designed to fill existing gaps in team composition, potentially leading to more dynamic and effective collaborations. Initial experiments with GenAI agents, fine-tuned with personality datasets, indicate a marked improvement in modelling and processing diverse personality traits. This framework promises to advance the practical application of AI in cultivating diverse and successful project teams, suggesting a significant shift in traditional project management methods towards more AI-integrated approaches.

556,Collaboration of AI Agents via Cooperative Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning [arXiv],2019,"There are many AI tasks involving multiple interacting agents where agents should learn to cooperate and collaborate to effectively perform the task. Here we develop and evaluate various multi-agent protocols to train agents to collaborate with teammates in grid soccer. We train and evaluate our multi-agent methods against a team operating with a smart hand-coded policy. As a baseline, we train agents concurrently and independently, with no communication. Our collaborative protocols were parameter sharing, coordinated learning with communication, and counterfactual policy gradients. Against the hand-coded team, the team trained with parameter sharing and the team trained with coordinated learning performed the best, scoring on 89.5% and 94.5% of episodes respectively when playing against the hand-coded team. Against the parameter sharing team, with adversarial training the coordinated learning team scored on 75% of the episodes, indicating it is the most adaptable of our methods. The insights gained from our work can be applied to other domains where multi-agent collaboration could be beneficial.",,第1页.xls
557,Low dose combinations of 2-methoxyestradiol and docetaxel block prostate cancer cells in mitosis and increase apoptosis,2009,"Clinical trials have shown that chemotherapy with docetaxel (Doc) combined with prednisone can improve survival of patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AI-PC). It is likely that the combination of Doc with other novel agents would also improve the Survival of AI-PC patients. We investigated whether the combination of Doc and 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), an endogenous metabolite of estradiol promising for cancer therapy, can increase apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer cells. Low concentration 2ME2 (0.5-1 mu M) + Doc (0.05-0.1 nM) combinations inhibit cell growth, increase G2/M cell cycle arrest, and increase apoptosis more effectively than the single concentrations in a variety of human AI-PC cells. Effects on apoptosis were associated with an increase in p53 protein and a decrease in cyclin A-dependent kinase activity. We then investigated whether the combination of 2ME2 + Doc can increase apoptotic cell death and inhibit the growth of prostate tumors in the FG/Tag transgenic mouse model of AI-PC. Doses of 2ME2 and Doc that increase mitotic cell cycle arrest result in an increase in apoptosis and lower primary prostate tumor weights in FG/Tag mice. High dose 2ME2 + Doc combinations did not increase G2/M cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in AI-PC cell lines and in the FG/Tag mice more than the single drugs. Overall, our data indicate that low dose 2ME2 + Doc combinations may provide a treatment strategy that can improve therapeutic efficacy against AI-PC while reducing toxicity often seen in patients treated with Doc.

558,Benchmarking Large Language Models on Communicative Medical Coaching: a Novel System and Dataset [arXiv],2024,"Traditional applications of natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare have predominantly focused on patient-centered services, enhancing patient interactions and care delivery, such as through medical dialogue systems. However, the potential of NLP to benefit inexperienced doctors, particularly in areas such as communicative medical coaching, remains largely unexplored. We introduce ``ChatCoach,'' an integrated human-AI cooperative framework. Within this framework, both a patient agent and a coaching agent collaboratively support medical learners in practicing their medical communication skills during consultations. Unlike traditional dialogue systems, ChatCoach provides a simulated environment where a human doctor can engage in medical dialogue with a patient agent. Simultaneously, a coaching agent provides real-time feedback to the doctor. To construct the ChatCoach system, we developed a dataset and integrated Large Language Models such as ChatGPT and Llama2, aiming to assess their effectiveness in communicative medical coaching tasks. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that instruction-tuned Llama2 significantly outperforms ChatGPT's prompting-based approaches.",,第1页.xls
559,An Intelligent Reinforcement Learning-Based Method for Threat Detection in Mobile Edge Networks,2024,"Traditional techniques for detecting threats in mobile edge networks are limited in their ability to adapt to evolving threats. We propose an intelligent reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for real-time threat detection in mobile edge networks. Our approach enables an agent to continuously learn and adapt its threat detection capabilities based on feedback from the environment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our technique outperforms traditional methods in detecting threats in dynamic edge network environments. The intelligent and adaptive nature of our RL-based approach makes it well suited for securing mission-critical edge applications with stringent latency and reliability requirements. We provide an analysis of threat models in multiaccess edge computing and highlight the role of on-device learning in enabling distributed threat intelligence across heterogeneous edge nodes. Our technique has the potential, significantly enhancing threat visibility and resiliency in next-generation mobile edge networks. Future work includes optimizing sample efficiency of our approach and integrating explainable threat detection models for trustworthy human-AI collaboration.The RL-based method improves threat detection in cloud networks, offering an adaptive and intelligent approach suitable for securing mission-critical applications.

560,"Can We Talk? - The Impact of Conversational Interfaces on Human Autonomy Teaming Perception, Performance and Situation Awareness",2020,"Human Autonomy Teaming (HAT) research has established that communication provides the key to building a teaming relationship between humans and autonomous agents (synthetic teammates). We hypothesised that a greater semblance of teaming could be achieved through more natural forms of audio-voice communication. In this study we evaluated the impact that providing a conversational interface (a voice) to the synthetic teammate had on the performance, SA and perception of teaming of the human teammate. Twenty-four participants conducted experimental trials on a computer-based task adapted from a LOA test method developed by Endsley and Kaber [8]. The results show that voice communication from the synthetic teammate can have a positive effect on human performance and perception of teaming; however, the pattern of improvement varied between different team structures.",,第1页.xls
561,Implementing Gesture Recognition in a Sign Language Learning Application,2020,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in contemporary times. It has a wide variety of application areas which can almost replicate tasks that humans would normally perform. Many companies that are using this form of technology are making efficiencies by replacing humans with AI agents. However, researchers are still making efforts to find ways to enhance artificial intelligence to be more human-like. Gesture recognition is a form of human computer interaction in which AI has the potential to improve. Similar to humans, AI has the ability to see and recognise gestures. Sign language is a language that a small proportion of the human population know and use. However, it is slowly gaining popularity and more resources are being provided in order to learn the language. Some people tend to go for in-person classes whereas others tend to go online or use applications to self-learn. This research discovers the success of technology such as gesture recognition to assist in learning sign language. The main research aim is to determine whether gesture recognition can assist self-learners in learning the language. The research has explored the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect shapes that represent sign language form. The research demonstrated different accuracies based on a small sample size of 10 participants using three different types of datasets: non pre-processed, skin mask, and Sobel filtered images. The CNN model trained with the skin mask dataset was overall the most suitable model in identifying gestures from images; however, the CNN model trained with the non pre-processed dataset was slightly more accurate in recognising the American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in realtime. All CNN models demonstrated accuracy levels above 70% proving that the CNN has the ability to recognise sign language gestures.",,第1页.xls
562,Onto4MAT: A Swarm Shepherding Ontology for Generalized Multiagent Teaming,2022,"Research in multi-agent teaming has increased substantially over recent years. Underneath these attempts sits a suite of communication functions to enable effective teaming. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems supporting the teaming arrangement have primarily relied on knowledge-based systems, with rules triggered based on the mode of interaction. Enabling humans to join the team of AI agents effectively calls for both the humans and AI agents to share their understanding and representation of their shared worlds. Such shared understanding requires formal representations of concepts to support transparency during bi-directional communications between team members. Little research has been done in this space, especially when humans need to team with a swarm of agents. We present an ontology designed specifically for human-agent teaming to address this research gap. The ontology is general, but we then contextualise it into a particular swarm-shepherding scenario to illustrate its use in a particular context. The proposed Ontology for Generalised Multi-Agent Teaming Onto4MAT offers the underlying building blocks for effective communication and shared understanding between humans and multi-agent teams.",,第1页.xls

565,Balancing the Scales of Explainable and Transparent AI Agents within Human-Agent Teams,2023,"With the progressive nature of Human-Agent Teams becoming more and more useful for high-quality work output, there is a proportional need for bi-directional communication between teammates to increase efficient collaboration. This need is centered around the well-known issue of innate mistrust between humans and artificial intelligence, resulting in sub-optimal work. To combat this, computer scientists and humancomputer interaction researchers alike have presented and refined specific solutions to this issue through different methods of AI interpretability. These different methods include explicit AI explanations as well as implicit manipulations of the AI interface, otherwise known as AI transparency. Individually these solutions hold considerable merit in repairing the relationship of trust between teammates, but also have individual flaws. We posit that the combination of different interpretable mechanisms mitigates each other's flaws and extenuates their strengths within human-agent teams.",,第1页.xls
566,Lending Interaction Wings to Recommender Systems with Conversational Agents,2023,"Recommender systems trained on offline historical user behaviors are embracing conversational techniques to online query user preference. Unlike prior conversational recommendation approaches that systemically combine conversational and recommender parts through a reinforcement learning framework, we propose CORE, a new offline-training and online-checking paradigm that bridges a COnversational agent and REcommender systems via a unified uncertainty minimization framework. It can benefit any recommendation platform in a plug-and-play style. Here, CORE treats a recommender system as an offline relevance score estimator to produce an estimated relevance score for each item; while a conversational agent is regarded as an online relevance score checker to check these estimated scores in each session. We define uncertainty as the summation of unchecked relevance scores. In this regard, the conversational agent acts to minimize uncertainty via querying either attributes or items. Based on the uncertainty minimization framework, we derive the expected certainty gain of querying each attribute and item, and develop a novel online decision tree algorithm to decide what to query at each turn. We reveal that CORE can be extended to query attribute values, and we establish a new Human-AI recommendation simulator supporting both open questions of querying attributes and closed questions of querying attribute values. Experimental results on 8 industrial datasets show that CORE could be seamlessly employed on 9 popular recommendation approaches, and can consistently bring significant improvements, compared against either recently proposed reinforcement learning-based or classical statistical methods, in both hot-start and cold-start recommendation settings. We further demonstrate that our conversational agent could communicate as a human if empowered by a pre-trained large language model, e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo.",,第1页.xls

569,"AI Agents as Team Members: Effects on Satisfaction, Conflict, Trustworthiness, and Willingness to Work With",2023,"Organizations are beginning to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) agents as members of virtual teams to help manage information, coordinate team processes, and perform simple tasks. How will team members perceive these AI team members and will they be willing to work with them? We conducted a 2 x 2 x 2 lab experiment that manipulated the type of team member (human or AI), their performance (high or low), and the performance of other team members (high or low). AI team members were perceived to have higher ability and integrity but lower benevolence, which led to no differences in trustworthiness or willingness to work with them. However, the presence of an AI team member resulted in lower process satisfaction. When the AI team member performed well, participants perceived less conflict compared to a human team member with the same performance, but there were no differences in perceived conflict when it performed poorly. There were no other interactions with performance, indicating that the AI team member was judged similarly to humans, irrespective of variations in performance; there was no evidence of algorithm aversion. Our research suggests that AI team members are likely to be accepted into teams, meaning that many old collaboration research questions may need to be reexamined to consider AI team members.",,第1页.xls
570,How Do People Ascribe Humanness to Chatbots? An Analysis of Real-World Human-Agent Interactions and a Theoretical Model of Humanness,2023,"A central problem in text-based chatbot research revolves around humanness: not only chatbots may reproduce fundamental aspects of being human, but also users may attribute humanlike features to chatbots. Humanness is paramount in human-chatbot conversations because it may profoundly impact the quality of the interaction: for example, when users expect that interactions with chatbots are similar to human conversations and these expectations are not met by the agent, they may easily become frustrated. This is particularly relevant in customer care, where efficient support is essential: here, unmet expectations about the chatbot's humanlike capabilities can undermine customer satisfaction. In this article, we qualitatively analyzed 12,477 real-world exchanges with a task-based chatbot in the customer care domain, involving a total of 1,060 conversations. We conducted a single case study to define a preliminary theoretical model of humanness for chatbot technology. The study findings point to a novel conceptualization of humanness in customer-chatbot interaction, highlighting that it is multiple, contextual, modular, and dynamic. Moreover, the theoretical model that we propose explains that the kind of humanness attributed to a chatbot depends on the context in which people expect to interact, the objectives and needs that they aim to fulfill, and the cues that the chatbot exhibits: all these factors may change as the interaction evolves over time, and such changes may further affect the users' ascriptions of humanness. Finally, we propose design implications of the model, like the need to create context and account for the plurality of humanness.",,第1页.xls

572,Collaborative AI Teaming in Unknown Environments via Active Goal Deduction,2024,"With the advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), we're seeing more scenarios that require AI to work closely with other agents, whose goals and strategies might not be known beforehand. However, existing approaches for training collaborative agents often require defined and known reward signals and cannot address the problem of teaming with unknown agents that often have latent objectives/rewards. In response to this challenge, we propose teaming with unknown agents framework, which leverages kernel density Bayesian inverse learning method for active goal deduction and utilizes pre-trained, goal-conditioned policies to enable zero-shot policy adaptation. We prove that unbiased reward estimates in our framework are sufficient for optimal teaming with unknown agents. We further evaluate the framework of redesigned multi-agent particle and StarCraft II micromanagement environments with diverse unknown agents of different behaviors/rewards. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework significantly advances the teaming performance of AI and unknown agents in a wide range of collaborative scenarios.",,第1页.xls
573,Hey Dona! Can you help me with student course registration? [arXiv],2023,"In this paper, we present a demo of an intelligent personal agent called Hey Dona (or just Dona) with virtual voice assistance in student course registration. It is a deployed project in the theme of AI for education. In this digital age with a myriad of smart devices, users often delegate tasks to agents. While pointing and clicking supersedes the erstwhile command-typing, modern devices allow users to speak commands for agents to execute tasks, enhancing speed and convenience. In line with this progress, Dona is an intelligent agent catering to student needs by automated, voice-operated course registration, spanning a multitude of accents, entailing task planning optimization, with some language translation as needed. Dona accepts voice input by microphone (Bluetooth, wired microphone), converts human voice to computer understandable language, performs query processing as per user commands, connects with the Web to search for answers, models task dependencies, imbibes quality control, and conveys output by speaking to users as well as displaying text, thus enabling human-AI interaction by speech cum text. It is meant to work seamlessly on desktops, smartphones etc. and in indoor as well as outdoor settings. To the best of our knowledge, Dona is among the first of its kind as an intelligent personal agent for voice assistance in student course registration. Due to its ubiquitous access for educational needs, Dona directly impacts AI for education. It makes a broader impact on smart city characteristics of smart living and smart people due to its contributions to providing benefits for new ways of living and assisting 21st century education, respectively.",,第1页.xls
574,Human Versus Artificial Intelligence: A Data-Driven Approach to Real-Time Process Management During Complex Engineering Design,2022,"Managing the design process of teams has been shown to considerably improve problem-solving behaviors and resulting final outcomes. Automating this activity presents significant opportunities in delivering interventions that dynamically adapt to the state of a team in order to reap the most impact. In this work, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent is created to manage the design process of engineering teams in real time, tracking features of teams' actions and communications during a complex design and path-planning task in multidisciplinary teams. Teams are also placed under the guidance of human process managers for comparison. Regarding outcomes, teams perform equally as well under both types of management, with trends toward even superior performance from the AI-managed teams. The managers' intervention strategies and team perceptions of those strategies are also explored, illuminating some intriguing similarities. Both the AI and human process managers focus largely on communication-based interventions, though differences start to emerge in the distribution of interventions across team roles. Furthermore, team members perceive the interventions from both the AI and human manager as equally relevant and helpful, and believe the AI agent to be just as sensitive to the needs of the team. Thus, the overall results show that the AI manager agent introduced in this work is able to match the capabilities of humans, showing potential in automating the management of a complex design process.",,第1页.xls
575,Metacognitive Monitoring: A Human Ability Beyond Generative Artificial Intelligence,2024,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive alignment with human cognitive processes, raising questions about the extent of their similarity to human cognition. This study investigates whether LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, possess metacognitive monitoring abilities akin to humans-particularly in predicting memory performance on an item-by-item basis. We employed a cross-agent prediction model to compare the metacognitive performance of humans and ChatGPT in a language-based memory task involving garden-path sentences preceded by either fitting or unfitting context sentences. Both humans and ChatGPT rated the memorability of these sentences; humans then completed a surprise recognition memory test. Our findings reveal a significant positive relationship between humans' memorability ratings and their actual recognition performance, indicating reliable metacognitive monitoring. In contrast, ChatGPT did not exhibit a similar predictive capability. Bootstrapping analyses demonstrated that none of the GPT models tested (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o) could accurately predict human memory performance on a per-item basis. This suggests that, despite their advanced language processing abilities and alignment with human cognition at the object level, current LLMs lack the metacognitive mechanisms that enable humans to anticipate their memory performance. These results highlight a fundamental difference between human and AI cognition at the metacognitive level. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing AI systems capable of effective self-monitoring and adaptation to human needs, thereby enhancing human-AI interactions across domains such as education and personalized learning.",,第1页.xls

The novelty relies on the introduction of a deep learning method into a real clinical workflow for medical imaging diagnosis. We attempt to address three high-level goals in the two above scenarios. Concretely, how clinicians: i) accept and interact with these systems, revealing whether are explanations and functionalities required; ii) are receptive to the introduction of AI-assisted systems, by providing benefits from mitigating the clinical error; and iii) are affected by the AI assistance. We conduct an extensive evaluation embracing the following experimental stages: (a) patient selection with different severities, (b) qualitative and quantitative analysis for the chosen patients under the two different scenarios. We address the high-level goals through a real-world case study of 45 clinicians from nine institutions. We compare the diag-nostic and observe the superiority of the Clinician-AI scenario, as we obtained a decrease of 27% for False -Positives and 4% for False-Negatives.

The other half of the design teams, designated as hybrid teams, have drone design and operation AI agents to advise them. Halfway through the team experiment, team structure is changed unexpectedly, requiring participants to adapt to the change. In the individual experiment, participants develop drones based on given design specifications, either on their own or with the availability of a drone design AI agent to advise them.

584,"It's Not Only What You Say, But Also How You Say It: Machine Learning Approach to Estimate Trust from Conversation",2024,"Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate trust from conversations using both lexical and acoustic data.Background: As NASA moves to long-duration space exploration operations, the increasing need for cooperation between humans and virtual agents requires real-time trust estimation by virtual agents. Measuring trust through conversation is a novel and unintrusive approach.Method: A 2 (reliability) x 2 (cycles) x 3 (events) within-subject study with habitat system maintenance was designed to elicit various levels of trust in a conversational agent. Participants had trust-related conversations with the conversational agent at the end of each decision-making task. To estimate trust, subjective trust ratings were predicted using machine learning models trained on three types of conversational features (i.e., lexical, acoustic, and combined). After training, model explanation was performed using variable importance and partial dependence plots.Results: Results showed that a random forest algorithm, trained using the combined lexical and acoustic features, predicted trust in the conversational agent most accurately ( R-adj(2) = 0.71 ) . The most important predictors were a combination of lexical and acoustic cues: average sentiment considering valence shifters, the mean of formants, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). These conversational features were identified as partial mediators predicting people's trust.Conclusion: Precise trust estimation from conversation requires lexical cues and acoustic cues.Application: These results showed the possibility of using conversational data to measure trust, and potentially other dynamic mental states, unobtrusively and dynamically.",,第1页.xls

586,Talk With Human-like Agents: Empathetic Dialogue Through Perceptible Acoustic Reception and Reaction,2024,"Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced agents become increasingly prevalent in Human-AI communication, offering vast potential from entertainment to professional domains. However, current multi-modal dialogue systems overlook the acoustic information present in speech, which is crucial for understanding human communication nuances. This oversight can lead to misinterpretations of speakers' intentions, resulting in inconsistent or even contradictory responses within dialogues. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose PerceptiveAgent, an empathetic multi-modal dialogue system designed to discern deeper or more subtle meanings beyond the literal interpretations of words through the integration of speech modality perception. Employing LLMs as a cognitive core, PerceptiveAgent perceives acoustic information from input speech and generates empathetic responses based on speaking styles described in natural language. Experimental results indicate that PerceptiveAgent excels in contextual understanding by accurately discerning the speakers' true intentions in scenarios where the linguistic meaning is either contrary to or inconsistent with the speaker's true feelings, producing more nuanced and expressive spoken dialogues.

The unique feature is that a BDS uses white-hat botnets to fight malicious botnets. The BDS monitors a network system. If detecting malicious botnets, it launches white-hat worms and constructs white-hat botnets in order to destroy the malicious botnets. A basic strategy is also proposed. The primary factor is the secondary infectivity of the white-hat worms. If it is high, the BDS only has to launch a few white-hat worms. Otherwise, it should launch as many white-hat worms as possible. The validity of the strategy was confirmed through simulation with agent-oriented Petri nets.",,第1页.xls

589,Modeling cooperative agents for customer network control using planning and agent-oriented programming,1992,"A testbed, called TEAM-CPS, that explores distributed cooperative architectures for customer network control is described. TEAM-CPS is used to model customer and public network operations support systems as intelligent knowledge-based agents that cooperate as do teams of human experts working together on common problems. An earlier proof-of-concept approach is generalized by the addition of a new and more practical framework for building autonomous agents. This framework is defined by the layered integration of two artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms: agent-oriented programming and classical AI planning. The application domain and this new framework are described, along with general AI techniques developed for TEAM-CPS. A simplified customer network management problem is used throughout, and an annotated trace of a three-agent dialogue, produced in TEAM-CPS, exemplifies the type of cooperative behavior and problem-solving performance that can be expected with current prototypes of TEAM-CPS.",,第1页.xls

593,Who needs explanation and when? Juggling explainable AI and user epistemic uncertainty,2022,"In recent years, AI explainability (XAI) has received wide attention. Although XAI is expected to play a positive role in decision-making and advice acceptance, various opposing effects have also been found. The opposing effects of XAI highlight the critical role of context, especially human factors, in understanding XAI's impacts. This study investigates the effects of providing three types of post-hoc explanations (alternative advice, prediction confidence scores, and prediction rationale) on two context-specific user decision-making outcomes (AI advice acceptance and advice adoption). Our field experiment results show that users' epistemic uncertainty matters when understanding XAI's impacts. As users' epistemic uncertainty increases, only providing prediction rationale is beneficial, whereas providing alternative advice and showing prediction confidence scores may hinder users' advice acceptance. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the human aspects of XAI by clarifying XAI and showing that XAI may not always be desirable. It also contributes by highlighting the importance of considering user profiles when predicting XAI's impacts, designing XAI, and providing professional services with AI.",,第1页.xls
594,Language agents achieve superhuman synthesis of scientific knowledge,2024,"Language models are known to produce incorrect information, and their accuracy and reliability for scientific research are still in question. We developed a detailed human-AI comparison method to evaluate language models on real-world literature search tasks, including information retrieval, summarization, and contradiction detection. Our findings show that PaperQA2, an advanced language model focused on improving factual accuracy, matches or outperforms subject matter experts on three realistic literature search tasks, with no restrictions on human participants (full internet access, search tools, and time). PaperQA2 generates cited, Wikipedia-style summaries of scientific topics that are significantly more accurate than current human-written Wikipedia entries. We also present LitQA2, a new benchmark for scientific literature research, which shaped the development of PaperQA2 and contributed to its superior performance. Additionally, PaperQA2 identifies contradictions in scientific literature, a challenging task for humans. It finds an average of 2.34 +/- 1.99 contradictions per paper in a random sample of biology papers, with 70% of these contradictions validated by human experts. These results show that language models can now surpass domain experts in important scientific literature tasks.",,第1页.xls
595,Understanding Communication Preferences of Information Workers in Engagement with Text-Based Conversational Agents,2024,"Communication traits in text-based human-AI conversations play pivotal roles in shaping user experiences and perceptions of systems. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), it is now feasible to analyze these traits at a more granular level. In this study, we explore the preferences of information workers regarding chatbot communication traits across seven applications. Participants were invited to participate in an interactive survey, which featured adjustable sliders, allowing them to adjust and express their preferences for five key communication traits: formality, personification, empathy, sociability, and humor. Our findings reveal distinct communication preferences across different applications; for instance, there was a preference for relatively high empathy in wellbeing contexts and relatively low personification in coding. Similarities in preferences were also noted between applications such as chatbots for customer service and scheduling. These insights offer crucial design guidelines for future chatbots, emphasizing the need for nuanced trait adjustments for each application.",,第1页.xls
596,Should My Agent Lie for Me? Public Moral Perspectives on Deceptive AI,2024,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements might deliver autonomous agents capable of human-like deception. Such capabilities have mostly been negatively perceived in HCI design, as they can have serious ethical implications. However, AI deception might be beneficial in some situations. Previous research has shown that machines designed with some level of dishonesty can elicit increased cooperation with humans. This raises several questions: Are there future-of-work situations where deception by machines can be an acceptable behaviour? Is this different from human deceptive behaviour? How does AI deception influence human trust and the adoption of deceptive machines? In this paper, we describe the results of a user study published in the proceedings of AAMAS 2023. The study answered these questions by considering different contexts and job roles. Here, we contextualise the results of the study by proposing ways forward to achieve a framework for developing Deceptive AI responsibly. We provide insights and lessons that will be crucial in understanding what factors shape the social attitudes and adoption of AI systems that may be required to exhibit dishonest behaviour as part of their jobs.",,第1页.xls
597,What Happens When Humans Believe Their Teammate is an AI? An Investigation into Humans Teaming with Autonomy,2021,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow in proficiency, the potential for AI to be used as team members rather than tools is becoming closer to realization. This advancement is driving new research investigations into the applicability of human-human teamwork knowledge to the context of human-autonomy teaming. In the current study, we apply qualitative methods to explore how the perceived composition of a team (how many humans and how many agents on the team) affects sentiments toward teammates, team processes, cognitive states, and the emergence of a system of team cognition. A total of 46 teams completed a teamwork simulation task and were interviewed afterwards regarding their teamwork experience. All of the teams were comprised of only humans; however, two conditions were led to believe that their teammate(s) were autonomous agents. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory and the Gioia methodology, which revealed thematic differences between the team compositions. In light of our results, we offer a new model that describes how early-stage action teams achieve effective team processes and emergent cognitive states. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第1页.xls
598,Fuzzy coordinator based intelligent agents for team coordination behavior in close combat games,2013,"Nowadays, many commercial computer games on the market have employed some AI techniques especially on the behaviors of NPCs (Non-Playable Characters). The aim is to make the NPCs game more human-like, immersive or natural. In a close combat game, creating strong AI forces require team coordination of NPCs. By employing an AI based agent (i.e. intelligent agent) for team coordination of NPCs leads to a deeper sense of immersion since NPCs are allowed to work together to produce better tactics and strategies. This technique faces many challenges since the intelligent agents are based on state transitions. The state transition leads to the decision for selecting the appropriate behavior by itself. Therefore, sometimes the selection could be failed to accomplish a team objective. This is due to weak coordination between NPCs and the intelligent agent. This paper describes the Fuzzy coordinator method to support the intelligent agent for selecting suitable behavior for each NPC. The intelligent agent who becomes the team leader will monitor and analyze health of each NPC, which one is strong and weak, which one has to back off or stays in the battle. The experimental result demonstrates that by employing the above technique, NPC behavior selection lead to appropriate coordination from leader which represented by keeping the health parameter 75 % and 50 % at maximum and minimum respectively.",,第1页.xls

The main aim is to have a system that can interact with a human. HCI (Human-Computer interaction) formulates the basis of an intelligent agent. In this paper, various technologies used in an agent along with its architecture are being presented. An Intelligent agent is software that can interact with humans using Artificial intelligence techniques. It is intractable for machines to understand natural language and incite its meaning and produce the response in the same language. A machine must be able to perceive the content and context of the data conducive to producing the correct result.",,第1页.xls
600,LLM-Based Cooperative Agents using Information Relevance and Plan Validation,2024,"We address the challenge of multi-agent cooperation, where agents achieve a common goal by interacting with a 3D scene and cooperating with decentralized agents under complex partial observations. This involves managing communication costs and optimizing interaction trajectories in dynamic environments. Our research focuses on three primary limitations of existing cooperative agent systems. Firstly, current systems demonstrate inefficiency in managing acquired information through observation, resulting in declining planning performance as the environment becomes more complex with additional objects or goals. Secondly, the neglect of false plans in partially observable settings leads to suboptimal cooperative performance, as agents struggle to adapt to environmental changes influenced by the unseen actions of other agents. Lastly, the failure to incorporate spatial data into decision-making processes restricts the agent's ability to construct optimized trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we propose the RElevance and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-3.5. REVECA leverages relevance assessment, plan validation, and spatial information to enhance the efficiency and robustness of agent cooperation in dynamic and partially observable environments while minimizing continuous communication costs and effectively managing irrelevant dummy objects. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of REVECA over previous approaches, including those driven by GPT-4.0. Additionally, a user study highlights REVECA's potential for achieving trustworthy human-AI cooperation. We expect that REVECA will have significant applications in gaming, XR applications, educational tools, and humanoid robots, contributing to substantial economic, commercial, and academic advancements.",,第1页.xls
601,"Effects of Autonomous Driving Context and Anthropomorphism of in-Vehicle Voice Agents on Intimacy, Trust, and Intention to Use",2023,"Recently, the intelligent in-vehicle voice agent (IVVA) using natural language processing (NLP) and capable of having a conversation have been introduced in autonomous vehicles (AVs). The IVVA is expanding its role not only to provide driving information and vehicle condition updates to ensure safety, but also to communicate and empathize with drivers like a friend in order to provide a more enjoyable driving experience. Accordingly, various anthropomorphic techniques have been applied to IVVAs and their effects evaluated. There is a tendency to focus on identifying whether anthropomorphic techniques are effective or not, but consideration of the autonomous driving contexts (ADCs) has been insufficient. Therefore, this study compares and evaluates the effects of the ADC (e.g., emergency stop, navigation, and casual conversations) on the interaction experience (specifically, intimacy, trust, and intention to use) from human-IVVA conversations by analyzing two IVVAs with different levels of anthropomorphism. As a result, the IVVA with the higher level of anthropomorphism encouraged greater intimacy. An interaction effect was confirmed based on the ADC and the level of anthropomorphism. In addition, regarding trust and intention to use, the IVVA with greater anthropomorphism was evaluated with a higher trust level and a stronger intention to use in an emergency stop situation. But the IVVAs did not always provide a positive experience in other driving contexts. The results of this study suggest that when designing an IVVA for AVs, it is necessary to use a conversation strategy appropriate to the situation by recognizing the ADC, rather than simply considering an increase in anthropomorphism.",,第1页.xls
602,Using Empathic Mixed Reality Agents for Remote Collaboration,2023,"This paper describes research on using Empathic Mixed Reality Agents (EMiRAs) for enhancing remote collaboration. Adopting Mixed Reality (MR) for remote collaboration is a promising so-lution which uses virtual avatars and visual cues to allow people to communicate naturally in three-dimensional (3D) MR environ-ments. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) make it possible to form hybrid teams of humans and AI driven virtual agents in MR environments. Forming hybrid teams to enhance human-to-human collaboration could be a promising way to take advantage of the complementary nature of human and AI agents. However, there still needs to be research conducted on how hybrid teams like this can improve MR remote collaboration. My research is focused on designing and evaluating EMiRAs for enhancing human-to-human remote collaboration. In this doctoral consortium presentation, I will introduce the EMiRA concept by identifying the convergence of Empathic Computing, MR and AI Agent.

604,Plan Explanations as Model Reconciliation An Empirical Study [arXiv],2018,"Recent work in explanation generation for decision making agents has looked at how unexplained behavior of autonomous systems can be understood in terms of differences in the model of the system and the human's understanding of the same, and how the explanation process as a result of this mismatch can be then seen as a process of reconciliation of these models. Existing algorithms in such settings, while having been built on contrastive, selective and social properties of explanations as studied extensively in the psychology literature, have not, to the best of our knowledge, been evaluated in settings with actual humans in the loop. As such, the applicability of such explanations to human-AI and human-robot interactions remains suspect. In this paper, we set out to evaluate these explanation generation algorithms in a series of studies in a mock search and rescue scenario with an internal semi-autonomous robot and an external human commander. We demonstrate to what extent the properties of these algorithms hold as they are evaluated by humans, and how the dynamics of trust between the human and the robot evolve during the process of these interactions.",,第1页.xls

Unsettled are the effects of these changes, their mechanism(s), and how to measure them. In this article, I propose a central concept for understanding human-machine interaction: convergent cause. That is, Agent 1's response to the object is caused by the object and Agent 2's response, while Agent 2 responds to Agent 1's response and the object. To the extent a human-machine team acts, AI converges with a human. One benefit of this concept is that it allows degrees, and so avoids the question of Strong or Weak AI. To defend my proposal, I repurpose Donald Davidson's triangulation as a model for human-machine teams and systems.",,第1页.xls

As an initial step towards adaptive agents, the present study examined individuals adaptive actions in a cooperative task. By analyzing the performance when participants paired with different partners, we were able to identify adaptations and isolate individual contributions to team performance. It is shown that the team performance is determined by factors at both individual and team levels. Using subjective similarity data collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we constructed high-dimensional embeddings of similarity distance between team trajectories. Results showed that team members who adapted most led to improved team performance. In current experiments we are extending our approach to examine the relation between teammate-likeness, sensitivity to social risk and performance in human-agent teams.",,第1页.xls

Understanding how AI systems can generate appropriate levels of trust among users is necessary to achieve this goal. This study focuses on the impact of displaying integrity, which is one of the factors that influence trust. The study analyzes how different integrity-based explanations provided by an AI agent affect a human's appropriate level of trust in the agent. To explore this, we conducted a between-subject user study involving 160 participants who collaborated with an AI agent to estimate calories on a food plate, with the AI agent expressing its integrity in different ways through explanations. The preliminary results demonstrate that an AI agent that explicitly acknowledges honesty in its decision making process elicit higher subjective trust than those that are transparent about their decision-making process or fair about biases. These findings can aid in designing agent-based AI systems that foster appropriate trust from humans.",,第1页.xls
610,Navigating autonomy and control in human-AI delegation: User responses to technology- versus user-invoked task allocation,2024,"Users can increasingly delegate to information systems (IS) - that is transferring rights and responsibilities regarding certain tasks - even to the degree that IS can act autonomously (i.e., without the intervention or supervision of users). What is more, IS increasingly offer to assume the rights and responsibilities for a task not only in response to user prompts (i.e., user-invoked delegation) but also without user prompts (i.e., IS-invoked delegation). Yet, little is known about whether, how, and why users agree to delegation when they are asked by the IS in contrast to when they self-initiate the delegation. Drawing on self-affirmation theory, we investigate user acceptance of IS- versus user-invoked delegation in two complementary online experiments in software development. Our core findings reveal that IS-invoked (vs. user-invoked) delegation increases users' perceived self-threat and thus decreases their willingness to accept delegation. This threatening effect is larger the less (vs. more) the user perceives control after the potential delegation. Taken together, we uncover defensive user responses to IS-invoked delegation. Furthermore, we shed light on the underlying and moderating mechanisms representing the reasons and contextual features that explain and mitigate these defensive measures. These findings have significant implications for IS designers seeking to improve user-IS collaboration and outcomes by employing IS-invoked delegation.",,第1页.xls

613,Team formation through an assessor: choosing MARL agents in pursuit-evasion games,2024,"Team formation in multi-agent systems usually assumes the capabilities of each team member are known, and the best formation can be derived from that information. As AI agents become more sophisticated, this characterisation is becoming more elusive and less predictive about the performance of a team in cooperative or competitive situations. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible way of anticipating the outcome of a game for any lineups (the agents, sociality regimes and any other hyperparameters for the team). To this purpose, we simply train an assessor using an appropriate team representation and standard machine learning techniques. We illustrate how we can interrogate the assessor to find the best formations in a pursuit-evasion game for several scenarios: offline team formation, where teams have to be decided before the game and not changed afterwards, and online team formation, where teams can see the lineups of the other teams and can be changed at any time.",,第1页.xls
614,Moral behaviour alters impressions of humans and AIs on teams: unethical AIs are more powerful while ethical humans are nicer,2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly being used as teammates, not just as tools, across many domains, and teammates' moral behaviour can alter impressions of themselves and the team. How good, powerful, and active is an AI versus human team member engaging in an ethical or unethical behaviour? How good, powerful, and active is their team? To address these questions, we conduct four studies across three domains (chess, esports, and poetry composition) where participants rate their impressions of team members and teams presented in a scenario. In the scenario, a member of a hybrid team of 2 humans and 2 AIs is presented with an opportunity to cheat, and either does or does not. We manipulate which team member (AI vs human) is acting and the morality of that action (non-cheating vs cheating). Across the studies, results show that ethical behaviour significantly increases the goodness of the human more than the AI, and unethical behaviour significantly increases the power of the AI more than the human. However, there were no systematic human versus AI differences on team impressions.",,第1页.xls

619,Algorithmically identifying strategies in multi-agent game-theoretic environments,2019,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has enormous potential for military applications. Fully realizing the conceived benefits of AI requires effective interactions among Soldiers and computational agents in highly uncertain and unconstrained operational environments. Because AI can be complex and unpredictable, computational agents should support their human teammates by adapting their behavior to the human's elected strategy for a given task, facilitating mutually-adaptive behavior within the team. While some situations entail explicit and easy-to-understand human top-down strategies, more often than not, human strategies tend to be implicit, ad hoc, exploratory, and difficult to describe. In order to facilitate mutually-adaptive human-agent team behavior, computational teammates must identify, adapt, and modify their behaviors to support human strategies with little or no a priori experience. This challenge may be achieved by training learning agents with examples of successful group strategies. Therefore, this paper focuses on an algorithmic approach to extract group strategies from multi-agent teaming behaviors in a game-theoretic environment: predator-prey pursuit. Group strategies are illuminated with a new method inspired from Graph Theory. This method treats agents as vertices to generate a timeseries of group dynamics and analytically compares timeseries segments to identify group coordinated behaviors. Ultimately, this approach may lead to the design of agents that can recognize and fall in line with strategies implicitly adopted by human teammates. This work can provide a substantial advance to the field of human-agent teaming by facilitating natural interactions within heterogeneous teams.",,第1页.xls
620,When Do Humans Heed AI Agents' Advice? When Should They?,2024,"Objective We manipulate the presence, skill, and display of artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations in a strategy game to measure their effect on users' performance. Background Many applications of AI require humans and AI agents to make decisions collaboratively. Success depends on how appropriately humans rely on the AI agent. We demonstrate an evaluation method for a platform that uses neural network agents of varying skill levels for the simple strategic game of Connect Four. Methods We report results from a 2 x 3 between-subjects factorial experiment that varies the format of AI recommendations (categorical or probabilistic) and the AI agent's amount of training (low, medium, or high). On each round of 10 games, participants proposed a move, saw the AI agent's recommendations, and then moved. Results Participants' performance improved with a highly skilled agent, but quickly plateaued, as they relied uncritically on the agent. Participants relied too little on lower skilled agents. The display format had no effect on users' skill or choices. Conclusions The value of these AI agents depended on their skill level and users' ability to extract lessons from their advice. Application Organizations employing AI decision support systems must consider behavioral aspects of the human-agent team.

This work presents two experiments (N=200 each) that measure peoples perceptions of eight different notions of moral responsibility concerning AI and human agents in the context of bail decision-making. Using real-life adapted vignettes, our experiments show that AI agents are held causally responsible and blamed similarly to human agents for an identical task. However, there was a meaningful difference in how people perceived these agents moral responsibility; human agents were ascribed to a higher degree of present-looking and forward-looking notions of responsibility than AI agents. We also found that people expect both AI and human decision-makers and advisors to justify their decisions regardless of their nature. We discuss policy and HCI implications of these findings, such as the need for explainable AI in high-stakes scenarios.",,第1页.xls

Given past examples where humans and autonomous systems can either succeed or fail at tasks, we seek to train a delegating manager agent to make delegation decisions with respect to these potential performance deficiencies. Additionally, we cannot always expect the various agents to operate within the same underlying model of the environment. It is possible to encounter cases where the actions and transitions would vary between agents. Therefore, our framework provides a manager model which learns through observations of team performance without restricting agents to matching dynamics. Our results show our manager learns to perform delegation decisions with teams of agents operating under differing representations of the environment, significantly outperforming alternative methods to manage the team.",,第1页.xls
632,"Designing Human-Agent Collaborations: Commitment, responsiveness, and support",2022,"With the advancements in AI, agents (i.e., smart products, robots, software agents) are increasingly capable of working closely together with humans in a variety of ways while benefiting from each other. These human-agent collaborations have gained growing attention in the HCI community; however, the field lacks clear guidelines on how to design the agents' behaviors in collaborations. In this paper, the qualities that are relevant for designers to create robust and pleasant human-agent collaborations were investigated. Bratman's Shared Cooperative Activity framework was used to identify the core characteristics of collaborations and survey the most important issues in the design of human-agent collaborations, namely code-of-conduct, task delegation, autonomy and control, intelligibility, common ground, offering help and requesting help. The aim of this work is to add structure to this growing and important facet of HCI research and operationalize the concept of human-agent collaboration with concrete design considerations.",,第1页.xls
633,Application of the GORITE BDI Framework to Human-Autonomy Teaming: A Case Study,2019,"Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) is of growing interest in the military sector, particularly in its application to war gaming using semi-automated computer generated forces (CGF). In these applications, one or more operators manage multiple semi-autonomous game entities. If effective collaboration (teaming) is to occur between operators and entities, then having effective interaction models is essential if the levels of trust and explanatory capability required for military operations are to be delivered. The Situation Awareness-Based Agent Transparency (SAT) Model has been identified as providing a suitable conceptual framework for such models. However, while the SAT model is informed by the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model of agency, to date there has been no implementation of an interaction model at the level of desires and intentions, i.e. goals. In this paper, we propose that GORITE, a novel BDI framework that employs explicit goal representations and a shared data context for goal execution, provides a suitable platform for the development of SAT-enabled agents. The feasibility of this proposition is demonstrated through the development of a simple but representative CGF case study.",,第1页.xls

635,Architecture and Interface for Collaborating with a Group of Agents in an Adversarial Game,2020,"Despite the impressive advances in artificial intelligence (AI), close collaboration between people and AI systems is still hard to achieve. To overcome this problem, we have designed an architecture consisting of the Contract Net Protocol, the Behavior Tree, and a human-multiple agent interface that we call human-swarm interaction. Its effectiveness and feasibility were evaluated using team play in a simulated Tail Tag game. Matches with up to 19 AI agents and 1 person on one team and 20 people on the other team were played. The results indicate that our system is scalable and that there is room for improvement. We identified two key features for AI agents to achieve collaboration with people in a serious game as represented by Tail Tag game: the ability to at least remain alive in any situation, and active declaration of roles being attempted as well as sharing of roles.",,第1页.xls

637,The Power of Teams that Disagree: Team Formation in Large Action Spaces,2015,"Recent work has shown that diverse teams can outperform a uniform team made of copies of the best agent. However, there are fundamental questions that were never asked before. When should we use diverse or uniform teams? How does the performance change as the action space or the teams get larger? Hence, we present a new model of diversity, where we prove that the performance of a diverse team improves as the size of the action space increases. Moreover, we show that the performance converges exponentially fast to the optimal one as we increase the number of agents. We present synthetic experiments that give further insights: even though a diverse team outperforms a uniform team when the size of the action space increases, the uniform team will eventually again play better than the diverse team for a large enough action space. We verify our predictions in a system of Go playing agents, where a diverse team improves in performance as the board size increases, and eventually overcomes a uniform team.",,第1页.xls
638,Attitude cycle for problem solving teams in a dynamic world,2004,"In this paper, a mental attribute called attitude is introduced and its importance in agent problem solving is discussed. It presents the various properties of agents describing how the attitudes of the agents affect the behavior of the agents. The paper also discusses how the attitudes could be described computationally in terms of various attributes. This paper formalizes the team as a collective abstract attitude of participating agents. This concept especially has been very useful in formalising the behaviour of complex teams. The team model grounds the team attitude as the individual attitude of its member agents, which in turn is further divided into the attitudes and behaviours towards the various team attributes. In this paper a team problem solving methodology is also presented, which has the notion attitude and team cycle as its core to allow robust and coherent team behavior. It also shows how these various attitudes ultimately result into various team behaviors in a fire world. The application and implementation of this methodology to a virtual fire-fighting domain has revealed a promising prospect in developing problem solving team agents.",,第1页.xls
639,Human perceptions on moral responsibility of AI: a case study in AI-assisted bail decision-making [arXiv],2021,"How to attribute responsibility for autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems' actions has been widely debated across the humanities and social science disciplines. This work presents two experiments (N=200 each) that measure people's perceptions of eight different notions of moral responsibility concerning AI and human agents in the context of bail decision-making. Using real-life adapted vignettes, our experiments show that AI agents are held causally responsible and blamed similarly to human agents for an identical task. However, there was a meaningful difference in how people perceived these agents' moral responsibility; human agents were ascribed to a higher degree of present-looking and forward-looking notions of responsibility than AI agents. We also found that people expect both AI and human decision-makers and advisors to justify their decisions regardless of their nature. We discuss policy and HCI implications of these findings, such as the need for explainable AI in high-stakes scenarios. [doi:10.1145/3411764.3445260].",,第1页.xls

641,Differentiating 'Human in the Loop' Decision Process,2021,"Recently, research by groups in academia, industry, and government has shifted toward the development of AI and machine learning tools to advise human decision-making in complex, dynamic problems. Within this collaborative environment, humans alone are burdened with the task of managing team strategy due to the AI-agent's use of an unrealistic model of the human-agent's decision-making process. This work investigates the use of an unsupervised machine learning method to enable AI-systems to differentiate between human decision-making strategies, enabling improved team collaboration and decision support. An interactive experiment is designed in which human-agents are subjected to a complex decision-making environment (a storm tracking interface) in which the provided visual data sources change over time. Behavioral data from the human-agent is collected, and a k-means clustering algorithm is used to identify individual decision strategies. This approach provides evidence of three distinct decision strategies which demonstrated similar degrees of success as measured by task performance. One cluster utilized a more analytic approach to decision-making, spending more time observing and interacting with each data source, while the other two clusters utilized more heuristic decision-making strategies. These findings indicate that if AI-based decision support systems utilize this approach to distinguish between the human-agent's decision strategies in real time, the AI could develop an improved awareness of team strategy, enabling better collaboration with human teammates.",,第1页.xls

644,A conceptual model for designing adaptive human-computer interfaces using the living systems theory,2009,"This paper discusses the application of the living systems theory (LST) to human-computer interface (HCI) design. It introduces LST as a paradigm for HCI design that can produce interfaces with self-learning and adaptive capabilities. From a biological system perspective, LST framework provides an emergence property to HCI, an attribute required to encourage self-organized behaviours during user interaction with computers. A sample interface in the domain of power systems information management is used to demonstrate the efficacy of LST as an adaptive HCI design tool. It is shown that the application of LST will not only provide a robust framework for designing HCI, but can also allow for real-time performance of the adaptive processes of the interface agents.

647,Human Factors Considerations for Teaming between Construction Workers and Voice-based Intelligent Virtual Agent (VIVA),2021,"Construction sites experience low productivity due to particular characteristics such as unique designs in each project, sporadic arrival of projects, and complexity of the process. Another contributing factor to low productivity is poor communication among workers, supervisors, and a site's centralized knowledge hub. Research shows that introducing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology in construction can tackle these problems. In this paper, we analyzed human factors considerations-user, task, environment, and technology and identified their characteristics and challenges to design an interactive AI system to facilitate communication between workers and other stakeholders. Based on the analysis, we propose a voice-based intelligent virtual agent (VIVA) as a multi-purpose AI system on construction sites with a further research agenda.

Aside from all the technological hurdles that have to be overcome on the hardware and control sides to make robots fit for work with humans, the added complication here is that humans have many conscious and subconscious expectations of their teammates - indeed, teaming is mostly a cognitive rather than physical coordination activity. This focus on cognitive coordination, however, introduces new challenges for the robotics community that require fundamental changes to the traditional view of autonomous agents. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the differences between traditional autonomous robots and robots that team with humans, identifying the necessary teaming capabilities that are largely missing from current robotic systems. We then focus on the important challenges that are unique and of particular importance to human-robot teaming, especially from the point of view of the deliberative process of the autonomous agent, and sketch potential ways to address them.",,第1页.xls

We anticipate that within our lifetimes it may become common practice for people to create a custom AI agent to interact with loved ones and/or the broader world after death. We call these generative ghosts, since such agents will be capable of generating novel content rather than merely parroting content produced by their creator while living. In this paper, we first discuss the design space of potential implementations of generative ghosts. We then discuss the practical and ethical implications of generative ghosts, including potential positive and negative impacts on individuals and society. Based on these considerations, we lay out a research agenda for the AI and HCI research communities to empower people to create and interact with AI afterlives in a safe and beneficial manner.",,第1页.xls

However, other aspects of emotion might be equally important, depending on the kind of interaction we are aiming at. My research has focused on two different aspects of affective computing. On the one hand, the generation of affect-driven expressive musical performances that can elicit different emotional states in humans, and that can also contribute to the understanding of how listeners perceive the expressive aspects that the musician intends to communicate. On the other hand, my work focuses on emotion synthesis for action selection and behavior modulation in autonomous agents.

The domain experts' specifications are compiled into behavior based agents.The 1999 RoboCup World Cup provided an interesting basis for evaluation of the approach. We found that for RoboCup it is not necessary to allow a user to change low level aspects of the agents' behavior in order for them to create a range of different, interesting teams.

661,Helmsman of the Masses? Evaluate the Opinion Leadership of Large Language Models in the Werewolf Game,2024,"Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited memorable strategic behaviors in social deductive games. However, the significance of opinion leadership exhibited by LLM-based agents has been overlooked, which is crucial for practical applications in multi-agent and human-AI interaction settings. Opinion leaders are individuals who have a noticeable impact on the beliefs and behaviors of others within a social group. In this work, we employ the Werewolf game as a simulation platform to assess the opinion leadership of LLMs. The game features the role of the Sheriff, tasked with summarizing arguments and recommending decision options, and therefore serves as a credible proxy for an opinion leader. We develop a framework integrating the Sheriff role and devise two novel metrics for evaluation based on the critical characteristics of opinion leaders. The first metric measures the reliability of the opinion leader, and the second assesses the influence of the opinion leader on other players' decisions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate LLMs of different scales. In addition, we collect a Werewolf question-answering dataset (WWQA) to assess and enhance LLM's grasp of the game rules, and we also incorporate human participants for further analysis. The results suggest that the Werewolf game is a suitable test bed to evaluate the opinion leadership of LLMs and few LLMs possess the capacity for opinion leadership.",,第1页.xls

The study compares quantitative survey data and qualitative interviews assessing outcomes between a control group and an experimental group leveraging Claude.ai over a semester across two graduate courses. Initial findings demonstrate tangible improvements in reading comprehension and engagement among participants using the AI agent versus unsupported independent study. However, there is potential for overreliance and ethical considerations that warrant continued investigation.

663,Designs for Enabling Collaboration in Human-Machine Teaming via Interactive and Explainable Systems,2024,"Collaborative robots and machine learning-based virtual agents are increasingly entering the human workspace with the aim of increasing productivity and enhancing safety. Despite this, we show in a ubiquitous experimental domain, Overcooked-AI, that state-of-the-art techniques for human-machine teaming (HMT), which rely on imitation or reinforcement learning, are brittle and result in a machine agent that aims to decouple the machine and human's actions to act independently rather than in a synergistic fashion. To remedy this deficiency, we develop HMT approaches that enable iterative, mixed-initiative team development allowing end-users to interactively reprogram interpretable AI teammates. Our 50-subject study provides several findings that we summarize into guidelines. While all approaches underperform a simple collaborative heuristic (a critical, negative result for learning-based methods), we find that white-box approaches supported by interactive modification can lead to significant team development, outperforming white-box approaches alone, and black-box approaches are easier to train and result in better HMT performance highlighting a tradeoff between explainability and interactivity versus ease-of-training. Together, these findings present three important directions: 1) Improving the ability to generate collaborative agents with white-box models, 2) Better learning methods to facilitate collaboration rather than individualized coordination, and 3) Mixed-initiative interfaces that enable users, who may vary in ability, to improve collaboration.",,第1页.xls

Conversational agents are even scripted to handle abuse in stereotypical ways. Such scripting, however, often escalates the abuse.

668,Human Decision-making in an Artificial Intelligence-Driven Future in Health: Protocol for Comparative Analysis and Simulation.,2022,"BACKGROUND: Health care can broadly be divided into two domains: clinical health services and complex health services (ie, nonclinical health services, eg, health policy and health regulation). Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming both of these areas. Currently, humans are leaders, managers, and decision makers in complex health services. However, with the rise of AI, the time has come to ask whether humans will continue to have meaningful decision-making roles in this domain. Further, rationality has long dominated this space. What role will intuition play?OBJECTIVE: The aim is to establish a protocol of protocols to be used in the proposed research, which aims to explore whether humans will continue in meaningful decision-making roles in complex health services in an AI-driven future.METHODS: This paper describes a set of protocols for the proposed research, which is designed as a 4-step project across two phases. This paper describes the protocols for each step. The first step is a scoping review to identify and map human attributes that influence decision-making in complex health services. The research question focuses on the attributes that influence human decision-making in this context as reported in the literature. The second step is a scoping review to identify and map AI attributes that influence decision-making in complex health services. The research question focuses on attributes that influence AI decision-making in this context as reported in the literature. The third step is a comparative analysis: a narrative comparison followed by a mathematical comparison of the two sets of attributes-human and AI. This analysis will investigate whether humans have one or more unique attributes that could influence decision-making for the better. The fourth step is a simulation of a nonclinical environment in health regulation and policy into which virtual human and AI decision makers (agents) are introduced. The virtual human and AI will be based on the human and AI attributes identified in the scoping reviews. The simulation will explore, observe, and document how humans interact with AI, and whether humans are likely to compete, cooperate, or converge with AI.RESULTS: The results will be presented in tabular form, visually intuitive formats, and-in the case of the simulation-multimedia formats.CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a road map for the proposed research. It also provides an example of a protocol of protocols for methods used in complex health research. While there are established guidelines for a priori protocols for scoping reviews, there is a paucity of guidance on establishing a protocol of protocols. This paper takes the first step toward building a scaffolding for future guidelines in this regard.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/42353.",,第1页.xls
669,Agent Supported Serious Game Environment,2016,"This study proposes and applies a novel concept for an AI enhanced serious game collaborative environment as a supplementary learning tool in tertiary education. It is based on previous research that investigated pedagogical agents for a serious game in the OpenSim environment. The proposed AI features to support the serious game are the following: a) a pedagogical game agent, b) non-playing characters, c) chat bots, and d) a game interface called Progress Map. This study aims to explore whether the utilization of AI features in game based collaborative learning in a tertiary education course can positively affect students' attitudes towards the course and educational games, students' game performance, as well as the students' perception of their learning environment. Summarizing, even though the intelligent game environment does not affect students' attitudes, neither towards the course nor towards the educational games, it has a positive impact on the performance of the teams and so it can be considered useful in collaborative game based learning. Moreover, the intelligent game environment improves the cohesiveness in the classroom after the completion of the game activity in terms of helping, supporting, and becoming connected to each-other.",,第1页.xls

672,Creating cooperative NPCs using Unity's ML-Agents,2023,"Non-player characters (NPCs) are one of the key components in many modern games. The degree of intelligence of NPCs directly affects the quality of the player's gaming experience. In this work, we use Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit for machine learning to create an AI that controls a team of NPCs. The main goal is to create intelligent team behaviour, without having fixed roles for each NPC within the team. The chosen game setting is a simple first-person shooter with a capture the flag mechanic to win the game. The main idea for the development of intelligent team behaviour presented in this paper is the creation of an Agent-Commander which assigns tasks to each NPC of the team to win the game. Each task is executed by a separately trained agent, an Agent-Executor, which only cares about its current goal, e.g., to steal the opponent's flag. The study is divided into two main stages: creating different environments and training Agents-Executors for specific tasks and secondly, the training of the Agent-Commander. We reveal the potential of using ML-Agents reinforcement learning toolkit for these kind of tasks, and explore the strategies developed by our AI through an analysis of its behaviour and the decisions being made during the game-play.",,第1页.xls
673,Impact of Heterogeneity and Risk Aversion on Task Allocation in Multi-Agent Teams,2021,"Cooperative multi-agent decision-making is a ubiquitous problem with many real-world applications. In many practical applications, it is desirable to design a multi-agent team with a heterogeneous composition where the agents can have different capabilities and levels of risk tolerance to address diverse requirements. While heterogeneity in multi-agent teams offers benefits, new challenges arise including how to find optimal heterogeneous team compositions and how to dynamically distribute tasks among agents in complex operations. In this work, we develop an artificial intelligence framework for multi-agent heterogeneous teams to dynamically learn task distributions among agents through reinforcement learning. The framework extends Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDP) to be compatible to model various types of heterogeneity. We demonstrate our approach with a benchmark problem on a disaster relief scenario. The effect of heterogeneity and risk aversion in agent capabilities and decision-making strategies on the performance of multi-agent teams in uncertain environments is analyzed. Results show that a well-designed heterogeneous team outperforms its homogeneous counterpart and possesses higher adaptivity in uncertain environments.",,第1页.xls

676,The hats simulator,2004,"The Hats Simulator is designed to be a lightweight proxy for many intelligence analysis problems, and thus a test environment for analysts' tools. It is a virtual world in which many agents engage in individual and collective activities. Most agents are benign, some intend harm. Agent activities are planned by a generative planner. Playing against the simulator, the job of the analyst is to find harmful agents before they carry out their plans. The simulator maintains information about all agents. However, information is hidden from the analyst and some is expensive. After each game, the analyst is assessed a set of scores including the cost of acquiring information about agents, the cost of falsely accusing benign agents, and the cost of failing to detect harmful agents. The simulator is implemented and currently manages the activities of up to one hundred thousand agents.",,第1页.xls
677,Latent Design Spaces: Interconnected Deep Learning Models for Expanding the Architectural Search Space,2024,"This work proposes an adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted workflow for architectural design, to enable the interrogation of possibilities which may otherwise remain latent. The proposed design methodology hinges on the systems theory consideration of architectural design, expressed in Christopher Alexander's systems generating systems, offering an alternative to the reductionist and complexity-lacking structure of design processes (Alexander 1968). This logic is pursued through the integration of DL models into an open-ended workflow of interconnected Deep Learning strategies (DL) and other computational tools, rather than treating it as a closed input-output cycle (single DL model). While a closed cycle risks flattening architectural layers, ending up with a reductionist encoding of design intentions, an open-ended workflow can inquire into an expanded design search space and augment creative decision making. This way, chained model strategies can simultaneously address design intentionality within discrete architectural layers (i.e. organization, composition, structure).This system enables three distinct modes of collaboration:human-human, human-AI,andAI-AI. Understanding the contribution of human and machine agents within the workflow offers a re-evaluation of designers' processes. The proposed nested workflow reflects the transition from 'expert systems', which rely on hard-coded rules, to 'learning systems', which are inspired by the human brain (DL) (Hassabis 2018). This allows architects to approach design problems which are not fully defined (Rossi 2019) and helps avoid over-constraining the search in creative domains like architecture. Furthermore, the design investigation is strengthened by accessing a search space that is otherwise beyond the designer's reach towards an expanded design creativity.",,第1页.xls
678,An AI Planning-Based Approach to the Multi-Agent Plan Recognition Problem,2018,"Multi-Agent Plan Recognition (MAPR) is the problem of inferring the goals and plans of multiple agents given a set of observations. While previous MAPR approaches have largely focused on recognizing team structures and behaviors, given perfect and complete observations, in this paper, we address potentially unreliable observations and temporal actions. We propose a multi-step compilation technique that enables the use of AI planning for the computation of the probability distributions of plans and goals, given observations. We present results of an experimental evaluation on a novel set of benchmarks, using several temporal and diverse planners.",,第1页.xls
679,Context-centric proactive information delivery,2004,"Delivering only those information relevant to the needs of teammates is critical for avoiding information overload. Need-driven proactive information delivery has thus been widely investigated in diverse areas spanning from psychology, AI, to Web-based services. CAST, a team-oriented agent architecture, realized proactive information delivery as a built-in agent behavior which is derived by the capability of anticipating others' information-needs based on a computational shared mental model. However the first implementation of CAST is limited in managing the dynamic activation and deactivation of team-mates' information-needs. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel mechanism for organizing and managing the context of information-needs, which facilitates information-needs to be activated and deactivated dynamically. We evaluate the proposed approach by comparing its performance with agent teams using only reactive communications (e.g., ask/reply) and with the original CAST agent teams.",,第1页.xls
680,"What makes an AI device human-like? The role of interaction quality, empathy and perceived psychological anthropomorphic characteristics in the acceptance of artificial intelligence in the service industry",2021,"Intelligent AI devices have become a common presence in the business landscape, offering a wide range of services, from the medical sector to the hospitality industry. From an organizational perspective, AI devices have several advantages, by performing certain tasks quicker and more accurately in comparison to humans while at the same time being more cost-efficient. However, in order to maintain the high standards of a brand, they have to be accepted by consumers and deliver socially adequate performance. Therefore, it is important to determine the characteristics of AI devices which make them accepted and trusted by consumers. Based on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Theory, we have researched on the role of psychological anthropomorphic characteristics, perceived empathy, and interaction quality in the acceptance of AI devices in the service industry. The results show that anthropomorphic characteristics alone do not influence acceptance and trust towards AI devices. However, both perceived empathy and interaction quality mediate the relation between anthropomorphic characteristics and acceptance. A human-like AI device has higher acceptance when it has the ability to show empathy and interaction in relation to the human consumer. This result reveals the importance of developing forms of strong intelligence and empathetic behaviour in service robots and AI devices. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第1页.xls
681,Deception in Reinforced Autonomous Agents: The Unconventional Rabbit Hat Trick in Legislation,2024,"Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), while offering a powerful foundation for developing natural language agents, raise safety concerns about them and the autonomous agents built upon them. Deception is one potential capability of AI agents of particular concern, which we refer to as an act or statement that misleads, hides the truth, or promotes a belief that is not true in its entirety or in part. We move away from the conventional understanding of deception through straight-out lying, making objective selfish decisions, or giving false information, as seen in previous AI safety research. We target a specific category of deception achieved through obfuscation and equivocation. We broadly explain the two types of deception by analogizing them with the rabbit-out-of-hat magic trick, where (i) the rabbit either comes out of a hidden trap door or (ii) (our focus) the audience is completely distracted to see the magician bring out the rabbit right in front of them using sleight of hand or misdirection. Our novel testbed framework displays intrinsic deception capabilities of LLM agents in a goal-driven environment when directed to be deceptive in their natural language generations in a two-agent adversarial dialogue system built upon the legislative task of lobbying for a bill. Along the lines of a goal-driven environment, we show developing deceptive capacity through a reinforcement learning setup, building it around the theories of language philosophy and cognitive psychology. We find that the lobbyist agent increases its deceptive capabilities by ~ 40% (relative) through subsequent reinforcement trials of adversarial interactions, and our deception detection mechanism shows a detection capability of up to 92%. Our results highlight potential issues in agent-human interaction, with agents potentially manipulating humans towards its programmed end-goal.",,第1页.xls

683,Multi Behavior NPC Coordination Using Fuzzy Coordinator And Gaussian Distribution,2015,"Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have an important role in modern computer games especially to make NPCs in games more human-like, believable and natural. In a real time warfare game, coordination of NPC troops can create a deeper sense of immersion. Anyhow, multi behavior NPC troops have intelligence for selecting their behavior itself which sometimes does not appropriate to accomplish a team objective. Therefore, in this research we propose to develop smart agent for team coordination to produce better team behavior. Fuzzy coordinator method is employed for team coordination based on smart agent as a leader in attacking scenario. The smart agent coordinates a team strategy with uncoordinated action from the NPC to produce coordinated action for each NPC. Gaussian distribution is used to make variation action of each NPC more natural and unpredictable. The experiment demonstrates the smart agent with fuzzy coordinator who becomes the leader can analyze attack time remaining, health of each NPC and enemy to decide which one has to offense or defense in battle by change decision of each NPC troop to select action that has contribution for team.",,第1页.xls

685,You Were Always on My Mind: Introducing Chef's Hat and COPPER for Personalized Reinforcement Learning.,2021,"Reinforcement learning simulation environments pose an important experimental test bed and facilitate data collection for developing AI-based robot applications. Most of them, however, focus on single-agent tasks, which limits their application to the development of social agents. This study proposes the Chef's Hat simulation environment, which implements a multi-agent competitive card game that is a complete reproduction of the homonymous board game, designed to provoke competitive strategies in humans and emotional responses. The game was shown to be ideal for developing personalized reinforcement learning, in an online learning closed-loop scenario, as its state representation is extremely dynamic and directly related to each of the opponent's actions. To adapt current reinforcement learning agents to this scenario, we also developed the COmPetitive Prioritized Experience Replay (COPPER) algorithm. With the help of COPPER and the Chef's Hat simulation environment, we evaluated the following: (1) 12 experimental learning agents, trained via four different regimens (self-play, play against a naive baseline, PER, or COPPER) with three algorithms based on different state-of-the-art learning paradigms (PPO, DQN, and ACER), and two dummy baseline agents that take random actions, (2) the performance difference between COPPER and PER agents trained using the PPO algorithm and playing against different agents (PPO, DQN, and ACER) or all DQN agents, and (3) human performance when playing against two different collections of agents. Our experiments demonstrate that COPPER helps agents learn to adapt to different types of opponents, improving the performance when compared to off-line learning models. An additional contribution of the study is the formalization of the Chef's Hat competitive game and the implementation of the Chef's Hat Player Club, a collection of trained and assessed agents as an enabler for embedding human competitive strategies in social continual and competitive reinforcement learning.",,第1页.xls

It is important that, while we encourage cooperation among agents in a team, we maintain autonomy of individual agents as much as possible, so as to maintain flexibility and generality. This paper presents an approach based on bidding utilizing reinforcement values acquired through reinforcement learning. We tested and analyzed this approach and demonstrated that a team indeed performed better than the best single agent as well as the average of single agents.",,第1页.xls

688,Differentiating 'Human in the Loop' Decision Process,2021,"Recently, research by groups in academia, industry, and government has shifted toward the development of AI and machine learning tools to advise human decision-making in complex, dynamic problems. Within this collaborative environment, humans alone are burdened with the task of managing team strategy due to the AI-agent's use of an unrealistic model of the human-agent's decision-making process. This work investigates the use of an unsupervised machine learning method to enable AI-systems to differentiate between human decision-making strategies, enabling improved team collaboration and decision support. An interactive experiment is designed in which human-agents are subjected to a complex decision-making environment (a storm tracking interface) in which the provided visual data sources change over time. Behavioral data from the human-agent is collected, and a k-means clustering algorithm is used to identify individual decision strategies. This approach provides evidence of three distinct decision strategies which demonstrated similar degrees of success as measured by task performance. One cluster utilized a more analytic approach to decision-making, spending more time observing and interacting with each data source, while the other two clusters utilized more heuristic decision-making strategies. These findings indicate that if AI-based decision support systems utilize this approach to distinguish between the human-agent's decision strategies in real time, the AI could develop an improved awareness of team strategy, enabling better collaboration with human teammates.",,第1页.xls

691,Allocation of Moral Decision-Making in Human-Agent Teams: A Pattern Approach,2020,"Artificially intelligent agents will deal with more morally sensitive situations as the field of AI progresses. Research efforts are made to regulate, design and build Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs) capable of making moral decisions. This research is highly multidisciplinary with each their own jargon and vision, and so far it is unclear whether a fully autonomous AMA can be achieved. To specify currently available solutions and structure an accessible discussion around them, we propose to apply Team Design Patterns (TDPs). The language of TDPs describe (visually, textually and formally) a dynamic allocation of tasks for moral decision making in a human-agent team context. A task decomposition is proposed on moral decision-making and AMA capabilities to help define such TDPs. Four TDPs are given as examples to illustrate the versatility of the approach. Two problem scenarios (surgical robots and drone surveillance) are used to illustrate these patterns. Finally, we discuss in detail the advantages and disadvantages of a TDP approach to moral decision making.",,第1页.xls
692,A Proposed Model of Learners' Acceptance and Trust of Pedagogical Conversational AI,2024,"Conversational AI (C-AI), like OpenAI's ChatGPT [38] or Google's Gemini [1], has seen a surge in development in recent years, driven by advancements in large language models. C-AI has the unique capability to instantaneously communicate with others using vast and contextual knowledge, providing personalized assistance tailored to individual needs. While the specific applications and advantages of conversational technologies are still being explored, prior research has noted the potential for conversational agents to serve in pedagogical settings, such as teaching agents, collaborative partners, or motivational tools [13, 30]. The successful development and implementation of pedagogical C-AI relies on an understanding of learners' perceptions, trust, and overall acceptance of C-AI. There is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing learners' trust and acceptance of this emerging technology.Grounded in the theories proposed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [16], the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [47], and Mayer, Davis and Schoorman's model of organizational trust [35], this paper proposes a model of learners' acceptance and trust for C-AI. The proposed model integrates factors relating to learners' perceptions and trust of C-AI, and additionally, four groups of moderating variables (e.g. individual characteristics). The proposed model hypothesizes that learners' perceptions and trust significantly influence their acceptance and behavioral intention to use C-AI. The relationships between learners' perceptions, trust, and acceptance are additionally proposed to be influenced by four groups of moderating variables: individual characteristics, AI characteristics, facilitating conditions, and subjective norms.To validate the proposed model, we plan to collect survey data and leverage structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. We will specifically evaluate the fitness of the proposed model through chi-square tests, RMSEA, CFI, and SRMR metrics. This study can provide valuable insights toward the scalable adoption and usage of C-AI in learning environments. Understanding the structural relationships between the factors that influence learners' acceptance and trust of pedagogical C-AI will be crucial for designing and deploying these technologies in ways that foster learners' engagement, self-efficacy, academic interest, and ultimately lead to positive learning outcomes.",,第1页.xls

Previous HCI works have explored how cuteness can be leveraged to create more joyful user experiences across a variety of technologies, for example, in the design of cute interfaces for AI agents and the cute physical and behavioral aspects of robots. These works rely on the Baby Schema identified by ethologist Konrad Lorenz to apply cuteness as a decoration. This pictorial explores ways that artists and designers can contribute their cultural and aesthetic understandings of cuteness to create richer interactive experiences. Our interpretive framework serves as a provocation for discussing the value of style in the design of interactive systems, and provides guidance for defining cuteness building blocks to support interdisciplinary teams of artists, designers and engineers in the creation of cute user experiences.",,第1页.xls
696,The effects of agent activeness and cooperativeness on team decision efficiency: A computational simulation study using Team-Soar,2007,"Within an organizational context, an agent type reflects the behavioral tendency that a member might employ across tasks. Until now, however, the impacts of agent types on team performance are not well understood. To address this issue, this study examines the relationships of agent activeness and cooperativeness with team decision efficiency at different degrees of information redundancy by using a team model consisting of four AI agents. This study presents the team model called Team-Soar and describes how the model implements agent activeness at two levels (active and passive) and agent cooperativeness at three levels (cooperative, neutral, and selfish). Then a computational simulation experiment is described. Results of the simulation indicate that the impacts of the agent type depend on the amount of information to be processed and active style boosts the effects of agent cooperativeness on team efficiency. The results also indicate that active agents do not always contribute team efficiency more than passive agents. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第1页.xls

Success depends upon giving the best clues for your teammate, who may be unknown. Previous Codenames AI agents make the implicit assumption that their teammate is using the same language model. We show how team performance can often be improved if an agent also assumes that their teammate will only observe a noisy version of each clue. We propose and evaluate several methods for adapting the scale of this noise over time and show that by adapting the noise level we can significantly outperform agent teams that do not adapt. These results demonstrate a successful method for adapting language-model based agents so that they perform better with a variety of teammates.",,第1页.xls
702,Explanation and Coordination in Human-Agent Teams: A Study in the BW4T Testbed,2011,"There are several applications in which humans and agents jointly perform a task. If the task involves interdependence among the team members, coordination is required to achieve good team performance. Coordination in human-agent teams can be improved by giving humans insight in the behavior of the agents. When humans are able to understand and predict an agent's behavior, they can more easily adapt their own behavior to that of the agent. One way to achieve such understanding is by letting agents explain their behavior. This paper presents a study in the BW4T coordination test bed that examines the effects of agents explaining their behavior on coordination in human-agent teams. The results show that explanations about agent behavior do not always lead to better team performance, but they do impact user experience in a positive way.",,第1页.xls

The coordination between agents is mainly obtained through shared mental states, communications and observations of actions of team members.

708,Developing Effective and Resilient Human-Agent Teamwork Using Team Design Patterns,2019,"Human-agent teams exhibit emergent behavior at the team level, as a result of interactions between individuals within the team. This begs the question how to design artificial team members (agents) as adequate team players that contribute to the team processes advancing team performance, resilience, and learning. This paper proposes the development of a library of team design patterns as a way to make dynamic team behavior at the team and individual level more explicit. Team design patterns serve a dual purpose: (1) in the system development phase, designers can identify desirable team patterns for the creation of artificial team members. (2) During the operational phase, team design patterns can be used by artificial team members to drive and stimulate team development and to adaptively mitigate problems that may arise. We describe a pattern language for specifying team design patterns, discuss their use, and illustrate the concept using representative human-agent teamwork applications.",,第1页.xls

711,An approach to mixed-initiative management of heterogeneous software agent teams,1999,"The rapid growth in research and development of agent-based software systems has led to concerns about how human users will control the activities of teams of agents that must actively collaborate. We believe that practical multi-agent systems developed will often be comprised of small teams of heterogeneous agents, under direct supervision by users acting as team leaders. We are now developing an environment for investigating approaches to controlling small to medium-sized groups of agents as coordinated teams. This environment will be used to explore mixed-initiative approaches to planning for the activities of agent teams and managing them during execution. Our approach arises out of a long-standing interest in mixed-initiative planning systems. In this paper, we discuss our approach to mixed-initiative agent team management, some representational issues involved in identifying compatible agent team members and the capabilities needed to monitor team execution.",,第1页.xls

They take on different work-related tasks for teams and single users such as scheduling meetings or stimulating creativity. Previous research merely focused on these positive aspects of introducing CAs at the workplace, omitting ethical challenges faced by teams using these often artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies. Thus, on the one hand, CAs can present themselves as benevolent teammates, but on the other hand, they can collect user data, reduce worker autonomy, or foster social isolation by their service. In this work, we conducted 15 expert interviews with senior researchers from the fields of ethics, collaboration, and computer science in order to derive ethical guidelines for introducing CAs in virtual team collaboration. We derived 14 guidelines and seven research questions to pave the way for future research on the dark sides of human-agent interaction in organizations.",,第1页.xls

Traditional approaches for team coordination require a lot of inter-agent electronic communication and often result in wasted effort. Methods that reduce inter-agent communication and conflicts are likely to increase productivity of virtual teams. In this research, we propose an evolutionary genetic algorithm based intelligent agent that will learn team member preferences from past actions and develop an agent-coordination schedule by minimizing schedule conflicts between different members serving on a virtual team.

Based on our analysis of cyber threats and opportunities in the coming years, we assess it as very likely that teams consisting of humans and synthetic agents will routinely work together in many if not most organizations. To fully leverage the potential of these teams, we must continue to develop new paradigms in human-machine teaming. Specifically, we must address three areas that are currently in their infancy. Firstly, we need interfaces that allow all teammates to communicate effectively with each other and seamlessly transfer tasks among them. This must be true regardless of whether the endpoints are human or not. Secondly, we will need cybersecurity operators with broad knowledge and skills. They must know how their synthetic teammates think, when to task them and when to question their reports. Thirdly, our AI systems must be able to explain their decision-making processes to their human teammates. This paper provides an overview of cyberspace threats and opportunities in the next ten years and how these will impact human-machine teaming. We then apply the key lessons we have learned while working a multitude of advanced research projects at the intersection of human and AI agents to cyberspace operations. Finally, we propose areas of research that will allow humans and machines to better collaborate in the future.",,第1页.xls
716,Moral Decision Making in Human-Agent Teams: Human Control and the Role of Explanations.,2021,"With the progress of Artificial Intelligence, intelligent agents are increasingly being deployed in tasks for which ethical guidelines and moral values apply. As artificial agents do not have a legal position, humans should be held accountable if actions do not comply, implying humans need to exercise control. This is often labeled as Meaningful Human Control (MHC). In this paper, achieving MHC is addressed as a design problem, defining the collaboration between humans and agents. We propose three possible team designs (Team Design Patterns), varying in the level of autonomy on the agent's part. The team designs include explanations given by the agent to clarify its reasoning and decision-making. The designs were implemented in a simulation of a medical triage task, to be executed by a domain expert and an artificial agent. The triage task simulates making decisions under time pressure, with too few resources available to comply with all medical guidelines all the time, hence involving moral choices. Domain experts (i.e., health care professionals) participated in the present study. One goal was to assess the ecological relevance of the simulation. Secondly, to explore the control that the human has over the agent to warrant moral compliant behavior in each proposed team design. Thirdly, to evaluate the role of agent explanations on the human's understanding in the agent's reasoning. Results showed that the experts overall found the task a believable simulation of what might occur in reality. Domain experts experienced control over the team's moral compliance when consequences were quickly noticeable. When instead the consequences emerged much later, the experts experienced less control and felt less responsible. Possibly due to the experienced time pressure implemented in the task or over trust in the agent, the experts did not use explanations much during the task; when asked afterwards they however considered these to be useful. It is concluded that a team design should emphasize and support the human to develop a sense of responsibility for the agent's behavior and for the team's decisions. The design should include explanations that fit with the assigned team roles as well as the human cognitive state.",,第1页.xls
717,Formal dialogue and its application to team formation in cooperative design,2005,"This paper presents a model of formal dialogue between intelligent and autonomous agents and its application to team formation in cooperative design. Using formal dialogue, agents exchange information about their specialty domain, ability, opportunity and willingness.

We consider multi-agent planning problem with task coordination using stochastic programming. Agents within a centralised team cooperate so that the expected team performance is maximised. The success of each agent to accomplish any task is critical for the team performance. Inaccuracy on estimation of uncertain success probability is addressed using robust optimisation where different uncertainty sets are considered. Robust optimisation computes the optimal task allocation simultaneously with worst-case by taking into account of all scenarios. The computational results show trade-off between team efficiency and robustness of solution.,,第1页.xls

In this case study, we report user experiences and lessons learned of the Enactive Virtual Environment for teaching practice (EVETeach) with AI-powered virtual student agents called Evelyn. We conducted a user study with a case study research design. We collected multiple sources of data from 24 student teachers, including participatory observations, field notes, semi-structured interviews, computer-based conversation logs, audio-, video-, and screen-recordings, and a cognitive walkthrough. We identified the following salient emerging findings as lessons learned: 1) Student teachers value and relate to the teaching practices in virtual reality simulation with AI-powered conversational agents, 2) AI-powered conversational agents inject humor to facilitate situational and social teaching practice, and 3) AI-powered conversational student agents maintain authentic discourse to promote student teachers' pedagogical reasoning.",,第1页.xls
722,Towards robust teams with many agents,2002,"Agents in deployed multi-agent systems monitor other agents to coordinate and collaborate. However, as the number of agents monitored is scaled up, two key challenges arise: (i) the number of monitoring hypotheses to be considered can grow exponentially in the number of agents; and (ii) agents become physically and logically unconnected (unobservable) to their peers. This paper examines these challenges in teams of cooperating agents, focusing on a monitoring task that is of particular importance to robust teamwork: detecting disagreements among team-members. We present YOYO, a highly scalable disagreement-detection algorithm which guarantees sound detection in time linear in the number of agents despite the exponential number of hypotheses. In addition, we present new upper bounds for the number of agents that must be monitored in a team to guarantee disagreement detection. Both YOYO and the new bounds are explored analytically and empirically in thousands of monitoring problems, scaled to thousands of agents.",,第1页.xls
723,What's the Difference? Reconciling Knowledge Structure Concepts to Aid AI Development for Human-Machine Teaming,2020,"A significant challenge for the development of artificial social intelligence for effective human-machine teams is defining the forms of artificial knowledge structures needed for machine agents to meaningfully engage in collaboration. Relevant to this, individual and shared knowledge structure concepts have been proposed across a variety of disciplines, resulting in a lack of conceptual clarity and impeding their operationalization for human-machine teaming. To reconcile conceptual differences across disciplines and enable the emergence of complex socio-cognitive abilities in machine agents, research is needed to integrate theory on the knowledge structures that underpin complex cognition. Toward this end, we survey research from the cognitive and computational sciences to develop a framework for the systematic application and evaluation of knowledge structure concepts for machine agents in teams. Our approach focuses on contextual factors, specifically the task environment structure and the situation temporality, that can help guide knowledge structure requirements for artificial social intelligence.",,第1页.xls

BDS is a cybersecurity system that utilizes white-hat botnets to defend IoT systems against malicious botnets. Once a BDS detects a malicious botnet, it launches white-hat worms in order to drive out the malicious botnet. The proposed strategy aims at the proper use of the worms based on the worms' capability such as lifespan and secondary infectivity. If the worms have high secondary infectivity or a long lifespan, the BDS only has to launch a few worms. Otherwise, it should launch as many worms as possible. The effectiveness of the strategy was confirmed through the simulation evaluation using agent-oriented Petri nets.",,第1页.xls

731,An Adversarial Approach for Automated Pokemon Team Building and Metagame Balance,2024,"Metagame balance is a crucial task in game development, and automation of this process could assist game developers by vastly reducing time costs. We explore and evaluate a metagame balance model over the recently proposed VGC AI Competition Framework. We propose an adversarial model where team builder agents try to maximize their win rate by narrowing to the most optimal team configurations, resulting in a reduction of the diversity of Pok & eacute;mon employed, while a balancing agent readapts the Pok & eacute;mon inner attributes to incentivize the team builder agents to incorporate a greater variety of Pok & eacute;mon into their teams increasing the metagame's overall diversity and balance. Furthermore, we develop multiple team builder agents divided into two groups: the first group assumes that individual Pok & eacute;mon advantages are the primary factor to determine the outcome of game matches; the second group also exploits the implicit synergy between teammates. These agents make use of metagaming, linear optimization, and evolutionary search to find strong combinations against the current metagame. The strongest team builder is faced against the team metagame balance agent for its evaluation. Deep learning is also employed to predict the outcome of matches and recommend constructive elements of teams.",,第1页.xls
732,Two-stage training algorithm for AI robot soccer [arXiv],2021,"In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the cooperative learning behavior of agents is very important. In the field of heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning, cooperative behavior among different types of agents in a group is pursued. Learning a joint-action set during centralized training is an attractive way to obtain such cooperative behavior, however, this method brings limited learning performance with heterogeneous agents. To improve the learning performance of heterogeneous agents during centralized training, two-stage heterogeneous centralized training which allows the training of multiple roles of heterogeneous agents is proposed. During training, two training processes are conducted in a series. One of the two stages is to attempt training each agent according to its role, aiming at the maximization of individual role rewards. The other is for training the agents as a whole to make them learn cooperative behaviors while attempting to maximize shared collective rewards, e.g., team rewards. Because these two training processes are conducted in a series in every timestep, agents can learn how to maximize role rewards and team rewards simultaneously. The proposed method is applied to 5 versus 5 AI robot soccer for validation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can train the robots of the robot soccer team effectively, achieving higher role rewards and higher team rewards as compared to other approaches that can be used to solve problems of training cooperative multi-agent.",,第1页.xls
733,The rationality of explanation or human capacity? Understanding the impact of explainable artificial intelligence on human-AI trust and decision performance,2024,"Artificial intelligence models can process massive amounts of data and surpass human experts in predictions. However, the lack of trust in algorithms sealed in the black box is one of the most challenging barriers to taking advantage of AI in human decision-making. Improving algorithm transparency by presenting explanations is one of the most common approaches to curing this. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been a recent research focus, but most concentrate on explainable algorithm development rather than human factors. Thus, the objective of this study is twofold: (1) to explore whether or not XAI can improve human performance and trust in AI in the competitive tasks of sales prediction, and (2) to reveal the different impact routines XAI on individuals with different task-related capacities. Based on a quasi-experimental study, our results indicate that XAI can improve human decision accuracy in the scenario of sales prediction in cross-border e-commerce. XAI cannot improve self-report trust to AI but can improve behavioral trust. We also found the placebo effect of explanation for relatively low task-related capacity.",,第1页.xls

739,"Human-computer co-operative systems: HCI research at Napier University, Edinburgh",2001,"Research in human-computer interaction at Napier University is centred on the HCI group based in the School of Computing. The group currently consists of one professor, eight full-time lecturers, two research fellows and six PhD students and is active in a number of areas of HCI These may be brought together under the overall research theme of human-computer co-operative systems. We believe that HCI is not merely about a person interacting with a computer; increasingly, it is concerned with how networks of computers (or other information artefacts), people and artificial agents engage in meaningful and effective activities. The distinctive nature of HCI research at Napier lies in its openness to different approaches to understanding the nature of interaction and on how to design for cooperation between people and information artefacts. The nature of design requires us to consider people engaged in co-operative activity, situated within a socio-cultural environment. Thus we find the concept of interaction, as traditionally understood, to be problematic. There is a need for designers ID be aware of non-cognitive and non-engineering approaches to the development of human-computer systems and to see design itself as a human activity. Our research seeks to contribute to the development of appropriate methods for understanding human-computer co-operative systems and to inform our understanding of design.",,第1页.xls
740,EVOLVING A TEAM IN A FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER GAME BY USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM,2013,"Evolving game agents in a first-person shooter game is important to game developers and players. Choosing a proper set of parameters in a multiplayer game is not a straightforward process because consideration must be given to a large number of parameters, and therefore requires effort and thorough knowledge of the game. Thus, numerous artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are applied in the designing of game characters' behaviors. This study applied a genetic algorithm to evolve a team in the mode of One Flag CTF in Quake III Arena to behave intelligently. The source code of the team AI is modified, and the progress of the game is represented as a finite state machine. A fitness function is used to evaluate the effect of a team's tactics in certain circumstances during the game. The team as a whole evolves intelligently, and consequently, effective strategies are discovered and applied in various situations. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed evolution method is capable of evolving a team's behaviors and optimizing the commands in a shooter game. The evolution strategy enhances the original game AI and assists game designers in tuning the parameters more effectively. In addition, this adaptive capability increases the variety of a game and makes gameplay more interesting and challenging.",,第1页.xls

This paper challenges the AI community to develop theory and to implement prototypes of ad hoc team agents.

742,Simultaneous team assignment and behavior recognition from spatio-temporal agent traces,2007,"This paper addresses the problem of activity recognition for physically-embodied agent teams. We define team activity recognition as the process of identifying team behaviors from traces of agent positions over time; for many physical domains, military or athletic, coordinated team behaviors create distinctive spatio-temporal patterns that can be used to identify low-level action sequences. This paper focuses on the novel problem of recovering agent-to-team assignments for complex team tasks where team composition, the mapping of agents into teams; changes over time. Without a priori knowledge of current team assignments, the behavior recognition problem is challenging since behaviors are characterized by the aggregate motion of the entire team and cannot generally be determined by observing the movements of a single agent in isolation. To handle this problem, we introduce a new algorithm, simultaneous team assignment and behavior recognition (STABR), that generates behavior annotations from spatio-temporal agent traces. The proposed approach is able to perform accurate team behavior recognition without an exhaustive search over the combinatorial space of potential team assignments, as demonstrated on several scenarios of simulated military maneuvers.",,第1页.xls
743,Integrity-based Explanations for Fostering Appropriate Trust in AI Agents,2024,"Appropriate trust is an important component of the interaction between people and AI systems, in that inappropriate trust can cause disuse, misuse, or abuse of AI. To foster appropriate trust in AI, we need to understand how AI systems can elicit appropriate levels of trust from their users. Out of the aspects that influence trust, this article focuses on the effect of showing integrity. In particular, this article presents a study of how different integrity-based explanations made by an AI agent affect the appropriateness of trust of a human in that agent. To explore this, (1) we provide a formal definition to measure appropriate trust, (2) present a between-subject user study with 160 participants who collaborated with an AI agent in such a task. In the study, the AI agent assisted its human partner in estimating calories on a food plate by expressing its integrity through explanations focusing on either honesty, transparency, or fairness. Our results show that (a) an agent who displays its integrity by being explicit about potential biases in data or algorithms achieved appropriate trust more often compared to being honest about capability or transparent about the decision-making process, and (b) subjective trust builds up and recovers better with honesty-like integrity explanations. Our results contribute to the design of agent-based AI systems that guide humans to appropriately trust them, a formal method to measure appropriate trust, and how to support humans in calibrating their trust in AI.",,第1页.xls

746,"Let's think together! assessing shared mental models, performance, and trust in human-agent teams",2022,"An emerging research agenda in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work focuses on human-agent teaming and AI agent's roles and effects in modern teamwork. In particular, one understudied key question centers around the construct of team cognition within human-agent teams. This study explores the unique nature of team dynamics in human-agent teams compared to human-human teams and the impact of team composition on perceived team cognition, team performance, and trust. In doing so, a mixed-method approach, including three team composition conditions (all human, human-human-agent, human-agent-agent), completed the team simulation NeoCITIES and completed shared mental model, trust, and perception measures. Results found that human-agent teams are similar to human-only teams in the iterative development of team cognition and the importance of communication to accelerating its development; however, human-agent teams are different in that action-related communication and explicitly shared goals are beneficial to developing team cognition. Additionally, human-agent teams trusted agent teammates less when working with only agents and no other humans, perceived less team cognition with agent teammates than human ones, and had significantly inconsistent levels of team mental model similarity when compared to human-only teams. This study contributes to Computer-Supported Cooperative Work in three significant ways: 1) advancing the existing research on human-agent teaming by shedding light on the relationship between humans and agents operating in collaborative environments, 2) characterizing team cognition development in human-agent teams; and 3) advancing real-world design recommendations that promote human-centered teaming agents and better integrate the two.",,第1页.xls

It is used to dynamically coordinate agent teams that perform distributed collaborative tasks. Current agent coordination approaches recognise team activity by considering team member mental states using explicit communication, plan recognition, and observation. Such information is sometimes incomplete or unavailable. Our strategy recognises team activities by analysing role relationships in hierarchical teamwork structures. At runtime, graph representations of team structures, called Rolegraphs, are extracted, capturing collaborative team activity. Rolegraphs are approximately matched against predefined templates of known behaviour to infer agent mental states, such as intention, in order to recognise team activities. A case base is then referenced to retrieve suitable examples of coordinated team action.",,第1页.xls

756,Did You Notice? Artificial Team-mates Take Risks for Players,2011,"Artificial agents are increasingly included in digital games, often taking on a role as a team-mate with human players. An interesting area of focus is the differences in player responses to team-mates that are either controlled by another human or a computer. Although there has been research examining social dynamics of team-mates and even some recent research comparing the responses to computer and human team-mates examining blame, credit, enjoyment, and differences in physiological responses of arousal, there does not seem to have been any research looking specifically at the differences in responses to acts of risk-taking on behalf of a team-mate. In order to study this question, a quantitative study was conducted in which 40 participants played a real-time, goal-oriented, cooperative game. The game allows (but does not require) players to perform risky actions that benefit their team-mates - specifically, players can draw gunfire towards themselves (and away from their team-mates). During the study, all participants played the game twice: once with an AI team-mate and once with a presumed human team-mate (i.e., an AI team-mate that they believed was a human team-mate). Thus, the team-mate performance and behaviors were identical for both cases - and in both cases, the team-mate drew gunfire an equal amount of the time. The main finding reported here is that players are more likely to notice acts of risk-taking by a human team-mate than by an artificial team-mate.",,第1页.xls
757,Studying the impact of negotiation environments on negotiation teams' performance [arXiv],2016,"In this article we study the impact of the negotiation environment on the performance of several intra-team strategies (team dynamics) for agent-based negotiation teams that negotiate with an opponent. An agent-based negotiation team is a group of agents that joins together as a party because they share common interests in the negotiation at hand. It is experimentally shown how negotiation environment conditions like the deadline of both parties, the concession speed of the opponent, similarity among team members, and team size affect performance metrics like the minimum utility of team members, the average utility of team members, and the number of negotiation rounds. Our goal is identifying which intra-team strategies work better in different environmental conditions in order to provide useful knowledge for team members to select appropriate intra-team strategies according to environmental conditions.

We propose a modeling framework for strategy-based multi-agent multi-team simulation environments. For these types of environments it is necessary to have a modeling infrastructure that allows for high-level, high-complexity, hierarchical interactions where team goals are prevalent but individual needs are balanced.

Our research interest focuses on the relationship between the distribution of authority in the firefighting team and its team performance. There are two types of authority distribution factors: self-managing factor and supervisor-centered factor. We found that a high team performance can be obtained when the self-managing factor is in the state of self-managing and the supervisor-centered factor is in the state of supervisor-centered. We also found that the self-managing factor has a major impact on the team performance.,,第1页.xls

To increase reliability of the solution, efficient group of experts should be formed. Here in this paper we have proposed a methodology for finding efficient team of experts for solution of a given problem collaboratively. The methodology is conceptualized with the notion of Multiagent system.

A challenging research issue in cooperation concerns the extent to which an agent should pay attention to the actions and effects of other agents. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of an object search team. We first propose the concept of an activity window which captures an agent's view of the activities and effects of the team. Then we pinpoint some criteria that can be used to determine whether it is beneficial for an agent to put an action of the team into its window. Finally, we present experimental results to test these criteria.",,第1页.xls
763,A model of symbiomemesis: machine education and communication as pillars for human-autonomy symbiosis,2021,"Symbiosis is a physiological phenomenon where organisms of different species develop social interdependencies through partnerships. Artificial agents need mechanisms to build their capacity to develop symbiotic relationships. In this paper, we discuss two pillars for these mechanisms: machine education (ME) and bi-directional communication. ME is a new revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) which aims at structuring the learning journey of AI-enabled autonomous systems. In addition to the design of a systematic curriculum, ME embeds the body of knowledge necessary for the social integration of AI, such as ethics, moral values and trust, into the evolutionary design and learning of the AI. ME promises to equip AI with skills to be ready to develop logic-based symbiosis with humans and in a manner that leads to a trustworthy and effective steady-state through the mental interaction between humans and autonomy; a state we name symbiomemesis to differentiate it from ecological symbiosis. The second pillar, bi-directional communication as a discourse enables information to flow between the AI systems and humans. We combine machine education and communication theory as the two prerequisites for symbiosis of AI agents and present a formal computational model of symbiomemesis to enable symbiotic human-autonomy teaming. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards symbiotic autonomous systems'.",,第1页.xls
764,Responsible Emergent Multi-Agent Behavior [arXiv],2023,"Responsible AI has risen to the forefront of the AI research community. As neural network-based learning algorithms continue to permeate real-world applications, the field of Responsible AI has played a large role in ensuring that such systems maintain a high-level of human-compatibility. Despite this progress, the state of the art in Responsible AI has ignored one crucial point: human problems are multi-agent problems. Predominant approaches largely consider the performance of a single AI system in isolation, but human problems are, by their very nature, multi-agent. From driving in traffic to negotiating economic policy, human problem-solving involves interaction and the interplay of the actions and motives of multiple individuals. This dissertation develops the study of responsible emergent multi-agent behavior, illustrating how researchers and practitioners can better understand and shape multi-agent learning with respect to three pillars of Responsible AI: interpretability, fairness, and robustness. First, I investigate multi-agent interpretability, presenting novel techniques for understanding emergent multi-agent behavior at multiple levels of granularity. With respect to low-level interpretability, I examine the extent to which implicit communication emerges as an aid to coordination in multi-agent populations. I introduce a novel curriculum-driven method for learning high-performing policies in difficult, sparse reward environments and show through a measure of position-based social influence that multi-agent teams that learn sophisticated coordination strategies exchange significantly more information through implicit signals than lesser-coordinated agents. Then, at a high-level, I study concept-based interpretability in the context of multi-agent learning. I propose a novel method for learning intrinsically interpretable, concept-based policies and show that it enables...",,第1页.xls
765,Agent-Based Game Platform with Cascade-Fuzzy System Strategy Module,2008,"As hardware performance rises, game users demand higher computer graphic, more convenient UI(User Interface), faster network, and smarter AI(Artificial Intelligence). At this time, however, AI development is accomplished by a co-development team or only one developer. For that reason, it's hard to verify that AI performance and basic game AI technology is lacking for developing high-level AI. Searching the merits and demerits of existing game AI platforms, we investigate main points to consider when designing game AI platforms in this paper. From this we suggest Darwin, a game platform, based on agent that developers embody AI easily and capable of proposing AI test with module that makes them find strategic position. And then evaluate achievement results through making agent used strategic module that Darwin offers.",,第1页.xls
766,Privacy-Aware Explanations for Team Formation,2023,"Over the recent years there is a growing move towards explainable AI (XAI). The widespread use of AI systems in a large variety of applications that support human's decisions leads to the imperative need for providing explanations regarding the AI system's functionality. That is, explanations are necessary for earning the user's trust regarding the AI systems. At the same time, recent legislation such as GDPR regarding data privacy require that any attempt towards explainability shall not disclose private data and information to third-parties. In this work we focus on providing privacy-aware explanations in the realm of team formation scenarios. We propose the means to analyse whether an explanation leads an explainability algorithm to incur in privacy breaches when computing explanation for a user.",,第1页.xls
767,Guided team selection,1996,"Team selection, the process of selecting a group of agents with complementary skills to achieve a goal, is an important collaborative task in multi-agent systems. Typically, team selection occurs at run-time using a first principles approach, for example after agents have exchanged relevant information about their abilities, loads, or other status. In time-critical domains such approaches may be impractical. Our work assumes that agents have limited resources and are embedded in a continuously changing world. We provide a mechanism whereby system developers can describe recipes for team selection in terms of the required abilities of the team, and appropriate run-time constraints. The paper provides definitions and algorithms, and includes comparisons with related work.",,第1页.xls
768,Interactive Journaling with AI: Probing into Words and Language as Interaction Design Materials,2023,"Conversational Agents (CAs) are making human-computer interaction more collaborative and conversational through using natural language. The HCI and interaction design communities, have been experimenting with and exploring the area of designing conversational interactions. Furthermore, interaction designers may need to acquire new skills for designing, prototyping, and evaluating artifacts that embody AI technologies in general, and CAs in particular. This paper builds upon a previous study on principles of designing interactive journaling experiences with CA and explores the practice of designing such experiences, using words, language, and conversations as design materials. We present a prototype for interactive and reflective journaling interaction with CA and the result of a Wizard of Oz experiment. Our findings suggest that designing interactions with CA challenges designers to use materials with inherently different natures and qualities. Despite this challenge, words appear to have unique characteristics to support designers to externalize and iterate on ideas, e.g., tone and intent. Hence, we suggest considering words, language, and conversations as the primary design materials, and the AI's predictability, adaptivity, and agency as secondary materials, while designing human interactions with Conversational Agents.",,第1页.xls

770,Why did my AI agent lose?: Visual Analytics for Scaling Up After-Action Review,2021,"How can we help domain-knowledgeable users who do not have expertise in AI analyze why an AI agent failed? Our research team previously developed a new structured process for such users to assess AI, called After-Action Review for Al (AAR/AI), consisting of a series of steps a human takes to assess an AI agent and formalize their understanding. In this paper, we investigate how the AAR/AI process can scale up to support reinforcement learning (RL) agents that operate in complex environments. We augment the AAR/AI process to be performed at three levels-episode-level, decision-level, and explanation-level-and integrate it into our redesigned visual analytics interface. We illustrate our approach through a usage scenario of analyzing why a RL agent lost in a complex real-time strategy game built with the StarCraft 2 engine. We believe integrating structured processes like AAR/AI into visualization tools can help visualization play a more critical role in AI interpretability.",,第1页.xls

772,Task Allocation with Load Management in Multi-Agent Teams,2022,"In operations of multi-agent teams ranging from homogeneous robot swarms to heterogeneous human-autonomy teams, unexpected events might occur. While efficiency of operation for multi-agent task allocation problems is the primary objective, it is essential that the decision-making framework is intelligent enough to manage unexpected task load with limited resources. Otherwise, operation effectiveness would drastically plummet with overloaded agents facing unforeseen risks. In this work, we present a decision-making framework for multi-agent teams to learn task allocation with the consideration of load management through decentralized reinforcement learning, where idling is encouraged and unnecessary resource usage is avoided. We illustrate the effect of load management on team performance and explore agent behaviors in example scenarios. Furthermore, a measure of agent importance in collaboration is developed to infer team resilience when facing handling potential overload situations.",,第1页.xls
773,Collective multi-agent cooperation,2017,"A multiagent system is a set of agents which collaborate and realize a collective product. We are interested by teams where agents have only a partial view on their team and of the collective products they generate. Teams cooperation allows them to exploit each other collective products, instead of exploiting individually the skills of agents from each team. This cooperation can help each team to realize or to enhance its own products. We propose a model to allow the cooperation of distributed preexisting teams by avoiding the disturbance of the initial functioning of each team. To meet this constraint, we insert virtual probes into each team to observe and to influence the agents in order to allow their cooperation by using collective products. The proposed approach is evaluated on a scenario where a sensor network and a drone network need to cooperate while designed and deployed separately.",,第1页.xls
774,What affects the usage of artificial conversational agents? An agent personality and love theory perspective,2023,"Artificial-intelligence (AI) powered conversational (CAI) agents have been growing in popularity. Like human personality, CAI agent personality can also impact the relationship users develop with them. In this work we adopt a multi-methodological systematic approach for generating CAI agent personality descriptors. 235 unique descriptors are obtained grouped into 8 personality dimensions. Having generated the personality framework, we propose a research model based on Stimulus Organism Response framework and Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love for explaining how these personality traits lead to formation of love with these agents affecting their usage scenario. Results indicate that all the three components of love (passion, intimacy, and commitment) have significant effects on the usage scenario. However, depending upon the agent personality the nature of relationships varies. Cognitive personality results in fatuous love, affective personality results in consummate love, and social personality results in friendly relationship. A conceptual difference is observed between brand love, and the love for AI. The results of this research will not only help the HCI designers to create suitable machine personality for various AI-based agents, but it will also provide an unconventional approach towards examining adoption of emerging AI-based technologies by exploring the love aspect between man and machines.

775,An Interaction Taxonomy of Human-Agent Teaming in Next Generation Combat Vehicle Systems,2021,"Next Generation Combat Vehicles (NGCVs) are incorporating more advanced technology which will enable humans and intelligent artificial agents to team up on the battlefield. Effective system design and evaluation for these human-agent teams require an understanding of individual and team tasks in the context of larger-scale operations. Previous taxonomies of human-automation interaction and human-agent teaming have been proposed, however, there is a lack of work focused on team interactions in the military domain and the teamwork dynamics required for our purposes are not captured. Unstructured interviews with subject matter experts, manuals, and relevant literature were synthesized, and a task analysis was conducted to develop a novel interaction taxonomy approach consisting of three primary categories, each with multiple dimensions:task,teamcomposition, andcommunication. This taxonomy may generalize into human-agent teaming within a variety of NGCV crews and serve as a model for characterizing human-agent team interactions in other domains.",,第1页.xls

AI Soccer is a 5:5 robot soccer game where each participant develops an algorithm that controls five robots in a team to defeat the opponent participant. Deep Q-Network is designed to implement our original rewards, the state space, and the action space to train each agent so that it can take proper actions in different situations during the game. Our algorithm was able to successfully train the agents, and its performance was preliminarily proven through the mini-competition against 10 teams wishing to take part in the AI Soccer international competition.

777,Designing for human-agent interaction,1998,"Interacting with a computer requires adopting some metaphor to guide our actions and expectations. Most human-computer interfaces can be classified according to two dominant metaphors: (1) agent and (2) environment. Interactions based on an agent metaphor treat the computer as an intermediary that responds to user requests. In the environment metaphor, a model of the task domain is presented for the user to interact with directly. The term agent has come to refer to the automation of aspects of human-computer interaction (HCI), such as anticipating commands or autonomously performing actions. Norman's 1984 model of HCI is introduced as reference to organize and evaluate research in human-agent interaction (HAI). A wide variety of heterogeneous research involving HAI is shown to reflect automation of one of the stages of action or evaluation within Norman's model. Improvements in HAI are expected to result from a more heterogeneous use of methods that target multiple stages simultaneously.",,第1页.xls

780,MDPs for adjustable autonomy in real-world multi-agent environments,2001,"Research on adjustable autonomy (AA) is critical if we are to deploy multi-agent systems in support of important human activities. Through AA, an agent can dynamically vary its level of autonomy - harnessing human abilities when needed, but also limiting such interaction. While most previous AA work has focused on individual agent-human interactions, this paper focuses on agent teams embedded in human organizations in the context of real-world applications. The need for agent teamwork and coordination in such environments introduces novel AA challenges. In particular, transferring control to human users becomes more difficult, as a lack of human response can cause agent team miscoordination; yet not transferring control causes agents to take enormous risks. Furthermore, despite appropriate individual agent decisions, the agent teams may reach decisions that are completely unacceptable to the human team. We address these challenges by pursuing a two-part decision-theoretic approach. First, to avoid team miscoordination due to transfer of control decisions, an agent: (i) considers the cost of potential miscoordination with team-mates; (ii) does not rigidly commit to a transfer of control decision; (iii) if forced into a risky autonomous action to avoid miscoordination, it considers changes in the team's coordination that mitigate the risk. Second, to ensure effective team decisions, not only individual agents, but also sub-teams and teams can dynamically adjust their own autonomy. We implement these ideas using Markov decision processes (MDPs), providing a decision-theoretic basis for reasoning about the costs and uncertainty of individual and team actions. This approach is central to our deployed multi-agent system, called Electric Elves, that assists our research group in re-scheduling meetings, choosing presenters, tracking people's locations and ordering meals.",,第1页.xls
781,Orchestrating Human Systems Integration Looking for the Right Mix for Human-Machine Teaming,2020,"Human systems integration (HSI) is commonly thought as the association of human-centered design (HCD) and systems engineering (SE). HCD relies on human-in-the-loop simulation (HITLS) and artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, AI and SE terminologies, methods, and tools should be harmonized in the context of human-machine teaming (HMT). Evolutions from singleagent to multi-agent approaches in AI, and from isolated-system to system-of-systems in SE are comparable. System and agent representations commonly apply to humans and machines. They are defined by their structures and functions. Based on research currently developed on HCD of increasingly-autonomous complex systems, this paper uses the Orchestra metaphor model that supports HMT organization design and management, based on: domain ontology (music theory); tasks and designers (scores and composers); activity and performance coordination (conductors); human/machine operators (musicians); end-users and consumers (audience). This approach requires elicitation, understanding and mastery of new interdependences, co-adaptation, and integration of agents emerging functions using HITLS.",,第1页.xls
782,Risk-Bounded Online Team Interventions via Theory of Mind,2024,"Despite advancements in human-robot teamwork, limited progress was made in developing AI assistants capable of advising teams online during task time, due to the challenges of modeling both individual and collective beliefs of the team members. Dynamic epistemic logic has proved to be a viable tool for representing a machine Theory of Mind and for modeling communication in epistemic planning, with applications to human-robot teamwork. However, this approach has yet to be applied in an online teaming assistance context and fails to account for the real-life probabilities of potential team beliefs. We propose a novel blend of epistemic planning and POMDP techniques to create a risk-bounded AI team assistant, that intervenes only when the team's expected likelihood of failure exceeds a predefined risk threshold or in the case of potential execution deadlocks. Our experiments and simulated demonstration on the Virtualhome testbed show that the assistant can effectively improve team performance.",,第1页.xls

The result is a new form of electronic institution that is created dynamically out of existing components to provide ad-hoc communication and coordination support for teamwork.

785,AI for dynamic team-mate adaptation in games,2010,"There is a long tradition of developing games in which the difficulty level is dynamically adapted to the performance of human players. However, there has been less work on the creation of game systems that perform dynamic team-mate adaption - and even less on developing team-mate NPCs (Non Player Characters) that adaptively support players in the face of opponents that adaptively increase the difficulty for the player. This paper is based on preliminary research to identify the key elements involved in developing buddy NPC team-mates that dynamically adapt to the needs and behaviors of human players while cooperating to compete against adaptive AI opponents. We discuss the computational and design challenges involved in developing such agents in the context of a simple test game called Capture the Gunner (CTG). The main contributions of the paper include: a proposed vocabulary and framework for understanding/modeling team-mate systems with adaptive difficulty, a particular technique for adaptive team-mate cooperation in the face of an adaptive opponent, and the identification of several significant new issues that arise in the process of developing computer games that involve adaptive NPC team-mates that cooperate with the player in the face of adaptive opponents.",,第1页.xls

For pragmatic reasons, behavioral cloning has usually been implemented and tested in simulation environments using a single nonexpert subject. In this paper, we capture behaviors for a team of subject matter experts engaged in real competition (a soccer tournament) rather than participating in a study. From this data set, we create software agents that clone the observed human tactics. We place the agents in a simulation to determine whether increased behavioral realism results in higher performance within the simulation and argue that the transferability of real-world tactics is an important metric for simulator validation. Other applications for validated agents include automated agent behavior, factor analysis for team performance, and evaluation of real team tactics in hypothetical scenarios such as fantasy tournaments.",,第1页.xls
794,Artificial intelligence in virtual reality simulation for interprofessional communication training: Mixed method study,2023,"Background: Virtual reality simulations are shown to be an effective approach for interprofessional nurse -physician communication training. However, its scalability is constrained by unequal medical-nursing cohort size, rendering a great challenge for all nursing students to form an interprofessional team with medical students. With the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), an AI medical team player can be integrated into virtual reality simulations for more nursing students to engage in interprofessional team training. Objectives: To describe the development of a novel AI-enabled virtual reality simulation (AI-enabled VRS) and to evaluate nursing students' competencies and experiences in communicating with an AI medical doctor.Methods: A mixed-methods design using a one-group pretest-posttest design and focus group discussions were employed in the evaluation phase. Nursing students from a university were recruited to undertake the 2-hour AI -enabled VRS. Pre-test and post-tests were administered to evaluate the participants' communication knowledge and self-efficacy. Survey questionnaires were administered to examine their experiences with the virtual reality environment and the AI doctor. Five focus group discussions were conducted to gain deeper insight into their learning experiences. Results: The participants demonstrated significant improvements in communication knowledge and interpro-fessional communication self-efficacy after the learning. They reported positively on the acceptability, feasibility and usability of the AI-enabled VRS. The subscale of human-like feature of the AI medical doctor was rated the lowest. Three themes surrounding participants' experiences of the virtual learning emerged: relate to the real world, artificial intelligence versus human intelligence and complement with face-to-face learning.Conclusions: This study demonstrates initial evidence on the potential of AI-enabled VRS in fostering nursing students' learning on interprofessional communication skills. The findings have also provided insights on how to improve the AI-enabled VRS, in particular, the expressiveness of the AI pedagogical agent and facilitating more dialogue trainings with learner-agent conversations.",,第1页.xls

798,Crossover operators for evolving a team,1997,"Cooperative co-evolutionary systems can facilitate the development of teams of heterogeneous agents. We believe that k different behavioral strategies for controlling the actions of a group of k agents can combine to form a cooperation strategy which efficiently achieves global goals. We examine the online adaption of behavioral strategies utilizing genetic programming. Specifically, we deal with the credit assignment problem of how to fairly split the fitness of a team to all of its participants. We present several crossover mechanisms in a genetic programming system to facilitate the evolution of more than one member in the team during each crossover operation. Our goal is to reduce the time needed to evolve a good team.",,第1页.xls
799,A distributed AI architecture for customer network control,1990,"A telecommunication network management application of distributed artificial intelligence research on cooperative distributed problem solving between dissimilar autonomous agents is described. From small personal subnets to large corporate networks, private network management and customer control of private networks ranks as an important new class of telecommunication services. Distributed network management automation systems, collections of intelligent, but dissimilar, agents that cooperate to solve common service provisioning and facility allocation problems, are proposed. Such agents form the basis of an architecture for joint private and public network management and customer network control. A research testbed, TEAM-CPS, that explores cooperative problem solving among such agents is described. Interagent cooperation in the testbed is illustrated with a simplified dialog between two agents jointly solving a facility failure problem.",,第1页.xls
800,UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES ON VIRTUAL TEAM PERFORMANCE: AN AGENT-BASED SIMULATION MODEL,2011,"Enterprises are constantly looking for ways to get the most from their geographically dispersed human resources by forming virtual teams, and leveraging communications technologies for enabling good team performance. The experience in using these technologies by virtual teams has been mixed at best, and the extant literature has gaps in offering satisfactory explanation for the variations. To address that gap, we have developed an agent-based simulation model to understand the dynamic complexities of the interplay between the characteristics of a virtual team, the task of the team, individuals forming the team, and the key functionalities provided by communications technologies, and to simulate the collaboration and work done by the team for its assigned tasks. Preliminary results point to the potential usefulness of the model to investigate the impact of communications technologies on virtual team performance.",,第1页.xls
801,A Wizard or a Fool? Initial Assessment of a Wizard of Oz Agent Supporting Collaborative Virtual Environments,2022,"A popular technique for evaluating envisioned AI agents without committing significant engineering resources to implement such an agent is the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) methodology. Thus far, many of the WoZ studies concerned with the design of conversational agents have been standalone systems for individual participants to interact with. The aim of this work was to determine whether a WoZ conversational agent could be embedded within an existing team-based collaborative virtual environment. In doing so, we uncovered a number of potential challenges in designing such a system which may be valuable for those implementing such a system in the future.",,第1页.xls
802,Dynamic Cooperative Interaction Strategy for Solving RCPSP by a Team of Agents,2016,"In this paper a dynamic cooperative interaction strategy for the A-Team solving the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is proposed and experimentally validated. The RCPSP belongs to the class of NP-hard optimization problems. To solve this problem a team of asynchronous agents (A-Team) has been implemented using multiagent environment. An A-Team consist of the set of objects including multiple optimization agents, manager agents and the common memory which through interactions produce solutions of hard optimization problems. In this paper the dynamic cooperative interaction strategy is proposed. The strategy supervises cooperation between agents and the common memory. To validate the proposed approach the preliminary computational experiment has been carried out.",,第1页.xls
803,Modeling role-based agent team,2007,"The problem of ensuring agents work as an effective team in dynamic distributed environments still remains a challenging issue. In this paper we proposed a role-based team model. In our model, the role characterizes the responsibilities and provides logic patterns to achieve certain goals and cooperate with others. The agent is an autonomous execution unit and follows the logic patterns that the role provides. We also developed algorithms and mechanisms to evolve the plan of a role to the plan of an agent. Our role-based team model allows the split of roles (who define the plans) and agents (who execute the plans) in team plans, and dynamic role-agent assignment. It also achieves a certain level of plan reusability. We present two experiments which show plan reusability and its flexibility in supporting simultaneously plan invocation.",,第1页.xls
804,Adaptation in Human-Autonomy Teamwork,2020,"With the development of AI technology, intelligent agents are expected to team with humans and adapt to their teammates in changing environments, as effective human team members would do. As an initial step towards adaptive agents, the present study examined individual's adaptive actions in a cooperative task. By analyzing the performance when participants paired with different partners, we were able to identify adaptations and isolate individual contributions to team performance. It is shown that the team performance is determined by factors at both individual and team levels. Using subjective similarity data collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we constructed high-dimensional embeddings of similarity distance between team trajectories. Results showed that team members who adapted most led to improved team performance. In current experiments we are extending our approach to examine the relation between teammate-likeness, sensitivity to social risk and performance in human-agent teams.",,第1页.xls
805,A framework for coordination and learning among teams of agents,1998,"We present a framework for team coordination under incomplete information based on the theory of incomplete information games. When the true distribution of the uncertainty involved is not known in advance, we consider a repeated interaction scenario and show that the agents can learn to estimate this distribution and share their estimations with one another. Over time, as the set of agents' estimations become more accurate, the utility they can achieve approaches the optimal utility when the true distribution is known, while the communication requirement for exchanging the estimations among the agents can be kept to a minimal level.",,第1页.xls
806,Action control of multiple agents using ADG; automatically defined groups,2000,"In generating a multi-agent team which solves a problem cooperatively by means of genetic programming (GP), it seems that a heterogeneous team performs better than a homogeneous team. In a heterogeneous team, however, as the number of agents increases, the size of search space becomes vast and the efficiency of search declines. One of the solutions of this problem is to divide a team into the proper number of groups, and to provide the same program for the all agents belonging to the same group. However it is difficult to know the adequate team structure beforehand. In order to solve these problems, we propose a method called ADG; Automatically Defined Groups. We applied this method to a simple load transportation problem and a modified Tile World problem, and confirmed that the optimal team structure was acquired by the method in each problem.",,第1页.xls

The general conceptual model of agent teams' antagonistic counteraction and cooperation is suggested. The task of developing the agent cyberworld, where agents realize the distributed attacks and defense, is investigated on the example of distributed denial of service attack subject domain. The architecture and implementation of research environment for agent-oriented simulation is presented. The environment is implemented on the basis of discrete-event simulation system that allowed to combine the agent-oriented and network protocol based simulation.",,第1页.xls

Adjusting autonomy of agent proxies in human organizations,2000,"Teams of heterogeneous agents working within and alongside human organizations offer exciting possibilities for streamlining processes in ways not possible with conventional software. To support effective user interaction with a complex multi-agent system we are developing a layered adjustable autonomy approach that allows users to intervene either with a single agent or with a team of agents. Previous work in adjustable autonomy (AA) has looked at either individual agents or whole teams but not, to our knowledge, a layered approach to AA.

809,"A Research Ensemble of Humans, Machines, and Algorithms: Future Designs of Research and Scholarly Communication",2024,"Bill Hart-Davidson's Writing with Robots [1] describes current practices of creating augmented research and writing teams that include robots, algorithms, and other machine partners with their human collaborators in designed space. In writing about emergent workplace practices in high technology environments, we (authors Michael and John) created a team of researchers, undergraduate research interns, and robot assistants to create the forthcoming book Artificial Infrastructures. In preparing the book, we used Otter.ai [2] to transcribe interviews with three working professionals. These rough transcriptions, produced by algorithmic assistants, saved the team important resources, namely time, money, and attention. Transcription tools like Otter.ai quickly create transliterated texts-word-for-word transcripts of spoken speech. In our ensemble, transcriptions were then edited by undergraduate researchers trained using Weiss's Learning From Strangers [3] as well as practice editing transcripts of other recordings of subject matter experts. The core finding was that we, as researchers, were able to concentrate on writing our analyses and organizing book contents while our undergraduate team members remained focused and more productive than previous teams working without advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Overall, it was a productive and enjoyable research process with less frustration and tedious, repetitious work, leading to more productive engagement. Our initial findings suggest that as long as researchers retain their autonomy in establishing the study agenda, and SMEs are informed how AI tools are going to be used, research can be streamlined and made more productive. We are realizing the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) outlined in Shneiderman [4] in which AI becomes a superpower. This experience report describes how AI tools, such as Otter.ai's transcription service, played a role in our research ensemble for creating our forthcoming book Artificial Infrastructures. It outlines the research team structure, use of AI tools, and the interplay between human and algorithmic agents to create a research ensemble that gestures towards a future for the design of communication.",,第1页.xls
810,SIMULATION OF AGENT TEAMS: APPLICATION OF A DOMAIN-INDEPENDENT FRAMEWORK TO COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY,2009,"The paper proposes an approach for multi-agent simulation of intelligent agent teams' collaboration and competition. This approach is for representing the complex processes ongoing in different subject domains by using various types of agent teams and their interactions. Teams can be in relations of indifference, antagonistic and non-antagonistic competing or (and) various kinds of cooperation, and may adapt to the actions of opponents or collaborators. The domain-independent multi-agent framework and common simulation environment are proposed. The suggested approach differs from other related approaches by attempting to formalize main components needed for agent teamwork and team collaboration and competition. The approach is applicable for the tasks of competitive activity in commerce, counteraction in the Internet, simulation of rescue operations, coalition actions, military conflicts, etc. We consider the theoretical models, implementation and investigations of the proposed approach on an example of simulation of distributed Internet attacks and defense.",,第1页.xls
811,On the Varying Benefit of Communication between Mobile Agents in a Decentralized Team,2009,"Cooperative behavior in decentralized mobile agents requires communication among them. However, such communication can also have negative consequences for a variety of reasons, and the benefits of communication can vary over the course of the agent team's task or mission. In this paper, we compare the benefits of communication over time for a team of mobile agents performing a general search-and-engage mission. Monte Carlo simulations show that communication provides variable benefit at different times and under different circumstances. In particular, communication can sometimes lead to poorer performance if agents have imperfect sensors.",,第1页.xls

814,Marsupial-like mobile robot societies,1999,"Work in mobile robots (Anderson et al., 1996; Murphy and Rogers, 1998) has generated a novel type of heterogeneous agent team: marsupial robots. In applications such as urban search and rescue, humans are often involved in control and communicating with the robot teams. As a result, marsupial robots offer rich, complex opportunities for exploring issues of: representation; adaptive control, communication and cooperation strategies; and reasoning about the roles of agents for a task and environment. The paper defines the marsupial robot team concept and proposes a taxonomy of roles for each agent. It describes the team members (human, dispensing agent, and passenger agent) in terms of the characteristics of more traditional agent societies. The marsupial concept is compared with related work in multi-agent robot teams. The paper also discusses the results of an investigation where environmental and task constraints dictate the deployment of passenger agents, and the resulting heuristics.",,第1页.xls
815,A note of caution regarding anthropomorphism in HCI agents,2013,"Universal usability is an important component of HCI, particularly as companies promote their products in increasingly global markets to users with diverse cultural backgrounds. Successful anthropomorphic agents must have appropriate computer etiquette and nonverbal communication patterns. Because there are differences in etiquette, tone, formality, and colloquialisms across different user populations, it is unlikely that a generic anthropomorphic agent would be universally appealing. Additionally, because anthropomorphic characters are depicted as capable of human reasoning and possessing human motivations, users may ascribe undue trust in these agents. Trust is a complex construct that exerts an important role in a users interactions with an interface or system. Feelings and perceptions about an anthropomorphic agent may impact the construction of a mental model about a system, which may lead to inappropriate calibrations of automation trust that is based on an emotional connection with the anthropomorphic agent rather than on actual system performance.

816,The Roles of Instructional Agents in Human-Agent Interaction Within Serious Games,2022,"Automated agent technology in video games is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that interacts with humans, and thus can provide interactive skills training via human-agent interaction. Having a good framework for agent types could help industry agent designers make best use of agents' capabilities. This research extends the previously established Human-Agent Team Game Analysis Framework from traditional video games to serious games focused on learning by clarifying the instructional agent types based on characteristics from the literature. Using the characteristics of (1) interaction timing, (2) level of autonomy, and (3) memory, agents of type Planner, Advisor, Critic, Companion, Actor, and Player were analyzed across eight different serious games. The new clarification of agent types could help agent designers decide the best agent type appropriate for their applications.",,第1页.xls

Intelligent agents are used to simulate team members of self-organizing teams. In the virtual self-organizing team, agents adapt the Q-learning algorithm to adjust their actions. Three sets of experiments are manipulated to study the evolution of rules. The results of few experiments show a new rule for conflict resolution emerged from the dynamic interactions of agents. For the other experiments, agents cannot resolve conflicts by themselves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第1页.xls
818,SiMAMT: a framework for strategy-based multi-agent multi-team systems,2017,"Multi-agent multi-team systems are commonly seen in environments where hierarchical layers of goals are at play. For example, theater-wide combat scenarios where multiple levels of command and control are required for proper execution of goals from the general to the foot soldier. Additionally, similar structures can be seen in game environments, where agents work together as teams to compete with other teams. The different agents within the same team must, while maintaining their own personality, work together and coordinate with each other to achieve a common team goal. This paper develops strategy-based multi-agent multi-team systems, where strategy is framed as an instrument at the team level to coordinate the multiple agents of a team in a cohesive way. The authors present SiMAMT, a framework for strategy-based multi-agent multi-team systems. The different components of the framework, including strategy simulation, strategy inference, strategy evaluation, and strategy selection are described. A formal specification of strategy and strategy-based multi-agent multi-team systems is provided. An example and experimental results are given to illustrate the proposed framework and its efficacy.",,第1页.xls

In particular, the use of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) opened new possibilities for studying different domains using social simulation. In the present work we have implemented and empirically evaluated a Multi-Agent Based Social Simulation (MABSS) system to support the formation of creative work teams. Based on existent psychological and organizational creativity studies, we have modelled a set of personal characteristics and contextual factors to represent and analyse their influence on creativity at both: the individual and the group level. The obtained initial results were significantly better than the results obtained with a pure stochastic model (average improvement of 8.2%). Additionally, we empirically confirm some hypothesis about group formation from the organizational studies.",,第1页.xls

An agent decides whether to offer help or not to another agent based on both utility gain and also social attachment consideration toward the other agent. We experiment with heterogeneous agents that use different combinations of utility and social relation to make decisions. We study the development of cooperative teams among agents as they help each other to accomplish tasks. We also evaluate the effect of social relationship development on individual agent's and the system's overall performance.",,第1页.xls

824,Future of Artificial Intelligence in Agile Software Development,2024,"The advent of Artificial intelligence has promising advantages that can be utilized to transform the landscape of software project development. The Software process framework consists of activities that constantly require routine human interaction, leading to the possibility of errors and uncertainties. AI can assist software development managers, software testers, and other team members by leveraging LLMs, GenAI models, and AI agents to perform routine tasks, risk analysis and prediction, strategy recommendations, and support decision making. AI has the potential to increase efficiency and reduce the risks encountered by the project management team while increasing the project success rates. Additionally, it can also break down complex notions and development processes for stakeholders to make informed decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach in which AI tools and technologies can be utilized to bestow maximum assistance for agile software projects, which have become increasingly favored in the industry in recent years.",,第1页.xls
825,Adjustable autonomy in real-world multi-agent environments,2001,"Through adjustable autonomy (AA), an agent can dynamically vary the degree to which it acts autonomously, allowing it to exploit human abilities to improve its performance, but without becoming overly dependent and intrusive in its human interaction. AA research is critical for successful deployment of multi-agent systems in support of important human activities. While most previous AA work has focused on individual agent-human interactions, this paper focuses on teams of agents operating in real-world human organizations. The need for agent teamwork and coordination in such environments introduces novel AA challenges. First, agents must be more judicious in asking for human intervention, because, although human input can prevent erroneous actions that have high team costs, one agent's inaction while waiting for a human response can lead to potential miscoordination with the other agents in the team. Second, despite appropriate local decisions by individual agents, the overall team of agents can potentially make global decisions that are unacceptable to the human team. Third, the diversity in real-world human organizations requires that agents gradually learn individualized models of the human members, while still making reasonable decisions even before sufficient data are available. We address these challenges using a multi-agent AA framework based on an adaptive model of users (and teams) that reasons about the uncertainty, costs, and constraints of decisions at all levels of the team hierarchy, from the individual users to the overall human organization. We have implemented this framework through Markov decision processes, which are well suited to reason about the costs and uncertainty of individual and team actions. Our approach to AA has proven essential to the success of our deployed multi-agent Electric Elves system that assists our research group in rescheduling meetings, choosing presenters, tracking people's locations, and ordering meals.",,第1页.xls
826,Empathic Interactions in Automated Vehicles #EmpathicCHI,2021,"Automation in driving will change the role of the drivers from actor to passive supervisor. Although the vehicle will be responsible for driving manoeuvres, drivers will need to rely on automation and understand its decisions to establish a trusting relationship between them and the vehicle. Progress has been made in conversational agents and affective machines recently. Moreover, it seems to be promising in this establishment of trust between humans and machines. We believe it is essential to investigate the use of emotional conversational agents in the automotive context to build a solid relationship between the driver and the vehicle. In this workshop, we aim at gathering researchers and industry practitioners from different fields of HCI, ML/AI, NLU and psychology to brainstorm about affective machines, empathy and conversational agent with a particular focus on human-vehicle interaction. Questions like What would be the specificities of a multimodal and empathic agent in a car?, How the agent could make the driver aware of the situation? and How to measure the trust between the user and the autonomous vehicle? will be addressed in this workshop.",,第1页.xls

The difficulty of the environment is altered by varying the perceptual capabilities of the agents in the game. The behaviours of the agents are evolved using a genetic program. These experiments show that the level of difficulty of the environment does have an impact on the evolvability of effective team behaviours; i.e. simpler environments are more conducive to the evolution of effective team behaviours than more difficult environments. In addition, the experiments show that no one best solution from any environment is optimal for all environments.",,第1页.xls

Gaia methodology was used for the design and analysis of the Simurgh multi-agent system. The main strategy was obtaining a higher score through the support of agents with a better perceived strategic placement.

We demonstrate the viability and utility of self-organization in an agent-based system involving complex interactions within the agent set. We present a multi-agent parametric design system called L-TEAM where a set of heterogeneous agents learn their organizational roles in negotiated search for mutually acceptable designs. We tested the system on a steam condenser design domain and empirically demonstrated its usefulness. L-TEAM produced better results than its non-learning predecessor, TEAM, which required elaborate knowledge engineering to hand-code organizational roles for its agent set.

An emerging landscape of development environments is making powerful RL techniques more accessible for a growing community of researchers. However, most existing frameworks do not directly address the problem of learning in complex operating environments, such as dense urban settings or defense-related scenarios, that incorporate distributed, heterogeneous teams of agents. To help enable AI research for this important class of applications, we introduce the AI Arena: a scalable framework with flexible abstractions for associating agents with policies and policies with learning algorithms.

833,Direct execution of team specifications in STAPLE,2002,Formal theories of teamwork are typically treated as software design specifications of team behavior. We take a different approach to programming teamwork by directly executing logical specifications of joint commitment and joint intention. This approach leads to a domain-independent framework for programming teamwork where one can modify (or add new) behavior for a team of agents just by modifying (or adding) logical sentences. One may also be able to predict the behavior of an agent team offline using its team intention specification and verify it by running the actual system.,,第1页.xls
834,"Tasks for agent-based negotiation teams: analysis, review, and challenges [arXiv]",2016,"An agent-based negotiation team is a group of interdependent agents that join together as a single negotiation party due to their shared interests in the negotiation at hand. The reasons to employ an agent-based negotiation team may vary: (i) more computation and parallelization capabilities; (ii) unite agents with different expertise and skills whose joint work makes it possible to tackle complex negotiation domains; (iii) the necessity to represent different stakeholders or different preferences in the same party (e.g., organizations, countries, married couple, etc.). The topic of agent-based negotiation teams has been recently introduced in multi-agent research. Therefore, it is necessary to identify good practices, challenges, and related research that may help in advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based negotiation teams. For that reason, in this article we review the tasks to be carried out by agent-based negotiation teams. Each task is analyzed and related with current advances in different research areas.

835,A Model for Estimating the Performance of a Team of Agents,2011,"In this paper, we present a model for estimating the performance of a team of agents, based on the capabilities of the agents and importance of these capabilities for the task. Performance of a team is assumed to be the sum of contributions of individual agents and contributions of subgroups built in the team. We introduce a set of notations, which is required for discussing the suggested models. We also propose a model to estimate the benefit of an agent from interaction with other agents in a subgroup. Based on this benefit model and different (common) strategies, the agents devise plans in which they formulate to what extent they are willing to cooperate with other agents. A negotiation algorithm that resolves the conflicts between the desires of the agents is presented. The effect of this algorithm and different strategies are tested on a set of generated data. The test results show that the performance of a team when the agents choose a cooperation strategy that follows the principle of least effort (Zipf's law) is higher than teams with other cooperation strategies.",,第1页.xls

841,Towards a distributed multi-agent system for a robotic soccer team,2000,"Many AI professionals consider RoboCup small robots league competition as an ideal platform for testing distributed artificial intelligence techniques. Among these techniques are Multi-Agent systems (MAS), which advocate collective intelligence by focusing on autonomy of agents and their intercommunication. Multi-Agent Systems have been used by. computer scientists and software engineers in several disciplines such as Internet and Industry [16]. For the robotics community Multi-Agent Systems was a paradigm shift from the classical centralized approach in building intelligent machines. By the late 80's MAS were used in several multi robot systems ranging from cellular robots (Fukuda et al) [1] to a team of trash-collecting robots (Arkin et al) [2]. This paper describes a distributed approach in implementing the Multi-Agent system architecture of a robotic soccer team, Temasek POlytechnic Team( TPOT).",,第1页.xls
842,Playmaker: Graphical definition of formations and setplays,2010,"The fall of chess as a main domain for Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, after the victory of Deep Blue over Kasparov, put forward robotic soccer as a new challenging domain for AI researchers. Robotic Soccer is very appropriate for researching in Distributed AI problems, e.g. coordination methodologies, whose results can later be applied to other domains. Coordination can be defined as the capability of several agents to work together as a team, in order to accomplish a common goal. In the context of robotic soccer, several aspects may benefit from appropriate coordination methodologies, since team play is decisive for winning the games. This paper presents a methodology to enable a team of robotic soccer agents to coordinate their positioning in the field, and a methodology that enables them to cooperatively execute predefined set plays (flexible plans). Both coordination methods are used in real soccer and sports in general, commonly known as formations and set plays respectively. However, its use in a team of autonomous agents is still unexplored and is a major innovation of this work. A graphical tool to define formations and set plays was fully developed in the context of this work offering a quicker and more appealing way to define both formations and set plays. The tool's interface was inspired on blackboard applications, used nowadays for the same purpose in real sports. The tool enables very easy definition of set plays that may then be executed in real-time during the matches. Examples of complete set plays and their practical execution are also described, showing the usefulness of the set play concept and the utility of the developed tool.",,第1页.xls
843,Context-aware mobile assistant agents in software project management,2008,"Inter team communication within a software project team is currently cumbersome considering the globally distributed development nature of software projects. We have designed a novel approach based on mobile multi-agent technology that would assist the members of a project teams in effectively communicating within themselves in scheduling meetings and relay of other information among globally distributed teams. Modeled using the GAIA methodology, the system also allows for offline scheduling of meetings and automatic synchronization as and when connection is established. The prototypical system has also been designed using the JADE LEAP platform. The novelty of this approach gives us a better insight into the utility of agent technology as applied to personalized software project management systems.",,第1页.xls

845,A New Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach,2010,"A new multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is proposed to learn the optimal behaviors among cooperative agent teams. The approach combines advantages of the integer programming, single agent learning and repeated game in a multi-agent framework. The integer programming is used to build cooperative teams in order to prevent the curse of dimensionality. Every cooperative team learns independently, whose members take the best response actions in the light of other agents actions in the same condition, after many repeated games, the aim root could be found. Because of other agents influence, the process of learning is supervised periodically, then through changing the learning rate to gain the right learning results. Simulation results on pursuit problem show that the proposed learning approach overcomes the divergence and improves learning speed obviously.",,第1页.xls
846,Emotional Debiasing Explanations for Decisions in HCI,2023,"Emotions play an important role in human decision-making. However, first approaches to incorporating knowledge of this influence into AI-based decision support systems are only very recent. Accordingly, our target is to develop an interactive intelligent agent that is capable of explaining the recommendations of AI-systems while taking emotional constraints into account. This article addresses the following research questions based on the emotions of happiness and anxiety: (1) How do induced emotions influence risk propensity in HCI? (2) To what extent does the explanation strategy influence the human explanation recipient in a lottery choice? (3) How well can an HCI system estimate the emotional state of the human? Our results showed that (1) our emotion induction strategy was successful. However, the trend took the opposite direction of ATF predictions. (2) Our explanation strategy yielded a change in the risk decision in only 26% of the participants; in some cases, participants even changed their selection in the opposite direction. (3) Emotion recognition from facial expressions did not provide sufficient indications of the emotional state - because of head position and a lack of emotional display - but heart rate showed significant effects of emotion induction in the expected direction. Importantly, in individual cases, the dynamics of facial expressions followed the expected path. We concluded that (1) more differentiated explanation strategies are needed, and that temporal dynamics may play an important role in the explanation process, and (2) that a more interactive setting is required to elicit more emotional cues that can be used to adapt the explanation strategy accordingly.",,第1页.xls

853,"Team-partitioned, opaque-transition reinforcement learning",1999,"We present a novel multi-agent learning paradigm called team-partitioned, opaque-transition reinforcement learning (TPOT-RL). TPOT-RL introduces the use of action dependent features to generalize the state space. In our work, we use a learned action-dependent feature space to aid higher-level reinforcement learning. TPOT-RL allows a team of agents to learn to cooperate towards the achievement of a specific goal. It is an adaptation of traditional RL methods that is applicable in complex, non-Markovian, multi-agent domains with large state spaces and limited training opportunities. TPOT-RL is fully implemented and tested in the robotic soccer domain, a complex, multi-agent framework.

855,Hierarchical Macro Strategy Model for MOBA Game AI,2019,"The next challenge of game AI lies in Real Time Strategy (RTS) games. RTS games provide partially observable gaming environments, where agents interact with one another in an action space much larger than that of GO. Mastering RTS games requires both strong macro strategies and delicate micro level execution. Recently, great progress has been made in micro level execution, while complete solutions for macro strategies are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based Hierarchical Macro Strategy model for mastering MOBA games, a sub-genre of RTS games. Trained by the Hierarchical Macro Strategy model, agents explicitly make macro strategy decisions and further guide their micro level execution. Moreover, each of the agents makes independent strategy decisions, while simultaneously communicating with the allies through leveraging a novel imitated cross-agent communication mechanism. We perform comprehensive evaluations on a popular 5v5 Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game. Our 5-AI team achieves a 48% winning rate against human player teams which are ranked top 1% in the player ranking system.",,第1页.xls

857,Content-Based Multimedia Analytics: US and NATO Research,2018,"The US and nations of the NATO Alliance are increasingly threatened by the global spread of terrorism, humanitarian crises/disaster response, and public health emergencies. These threats are influenced by the unprecedented rise of information sharing technologies and practices, where mobile access to social networking sites is ubiquitous. In this new information environment, agile data algorithms, machine learning software, and threat alert mechanisms must be developed to automatically create alerts and drive quick response. US science and technology investments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Human Agent Teaming (HAT) are increasingly focused on developing capabilities toward that end. A critical foundation of these technologies is the awareness of the underlying context to accurately interpret machine-processed warnings and recommendations. In this sense, context can be a dynamic characteristic of the operating environment and demands a multi-analytic approach In this paper, we describe US doctrine that formulates capability requirements for operations in the information environment. We then describe a promising social computing approach that brings together information retrieval strategies using multimedia sources that include text, video, and imagery. Social computing is used in this case to increase awareness of societal dynamics at various scales that influence and impact military operations in both the physical and information domains Our focus, content based information retrieval and multimedia analytics, involves the exploitation of multiple data sources to deliver timely and accurate synopses of data that can be combined with human intuition and understanding to develop a comprehensive worldview.",,第1页.xls

859,Harnessing agent-based games research for analysis of collective agent Behavior in critical settings,2006,"This paper presents an AI architecture that has been developed specifically for controlling complex multi-agents interaction in games. The model is based on previous research into Emotional Societies and presents a realistic and believable environment for games. In response to a perceived lack of depth and realism in the team relationship dynamics of modem gaming, we developed a human agent architecture, multi-agent system, and demonstrative game application. The agent architecture was based partially on research into social psychology, and utilized emotion and belief representations to drive action selection. Agent interaction and relationship development was produced on the basis of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), through which a team's success came to be determined by its members' choices to cooperate or compete with its leader. A produced game application illustrated the operation of the developed architecture within the context of a political street protest. A set of evaluation scenarios were devised to test the success of the project work within this game application, and ultimately found it to be successful in achieving a good level of realistic team-based reasoning and interaction. Beside the potential application of the model and architecture to a computer entertainment environment, the model is generic and can be used as well for serious application which involves distributed emerging behavior, scenarios based simulation, complex agent-based modeling including emotional, reactive and deliberative reasoning.",,第1页.xls

864,A framework for enhancing human-agent teamwork through adaptive individualized technologies,2019,"Future military operations will require teams of Soldiers and intelligent systems to plan and execute collective action in a dynamic and adversarial environment. In human teams, teamwork processes such as effective communication and shared understanding underlie effective team performance. Recent work proposes a vision for generalizing this theory to human-agent teams and facilitating teamwork via individualized, adaptive technologies. We propose a dynamical system model to understand how individualized, adaptive technology can facilitate teamwork in human-agent teams. The model reveals three scientific challenges: describing the dynamics of team state, understanding how technological interventions will manifest in team states, and observing latent teamwork states. Using this model, we motivate a problem in which we predict team outcomes from non-obtrusive observation of a military staff during a training exercise. Representing pairwise interactions between team members as a weighted adjacency matrix, we use low-rank matrix recovery techniques to identify communication patterns that predict external evaluations of three team processes during task completion: effective communication, shared understanding, and positive affect.",,第1页.xls

This investigation looked at the framing of agent communication and how it might interact with level of agent transparency.

871,The Effects of Cooperativeness and Information Redundancy on Team Performance：A Simulation Study,2002,"Cooperativeness within an organization can be conceptualized as the degree of members' willingness to work with others. The simulation study investigates the relationships of cooperativeness with team performance at different levels of information redundancy by using a multi-agents model called Team-Soar. The model consists of a group of four individual AI agents situated in a network, which models a naval command and control team consisting of four members. The study used a 9 X 3 design in which agent cooperativeness was manipulated at nine levels by gradually replacing selfish team members with increasing numbers of neutral and cooperative members, while information redundancy was controlled at three different levels (i.e., low, medium, and high). Results of the Team-Soar simulation show that cooperation has positive impacts on team performance.

875,Combining job and team selection heuristics,2009,"In open markets and within business and government organizations, selfish agents often face the question of what tasks to work on, and what partners to work with. Optimal solutions are particularly difficult to find in large- scale, unpredictably dynamic environments. Previous work has examined the use of separate job selection and team selection heuristics to guide agent decisions in these domains, but did not explore how these decisions influence each other, and how these heuristics should therefore be used together. Accordingly, this paper presents a mechanism for combining job and team selection heuristics for agents operating in a large-scale, unpredictably dynamic environment. An experimental analysis of this new job/team selection mechanism demonstrates significant improvements in agent performance, both in terms of credit earned and in percentage of jobs successfully completed.",,第1页.xls

877,Teamwork under extreme uncertainty: AI for Pokemon ranks 33rd in the world [arXiv],2022,"The highest grossing media franchise of all times, with over 90 billion in total revenue, is Pokemon. The video games belong to the class of Japanese Role Playing Games (J-RPG). Developing a powerful AI agent for these games is very hard because they present big challenges to MinMax, Monte Carlo Tree Search and statistical Machine Learning, as they are vastly different from the well explored in AI literature games. An AI agent for one of these games means significant progress in AI agents for the entire class. Further, the key principles of such work can hopefully inspire approaches to several domains that require excellent teamwork under conditions of extreme uncertainty, including managing a team of doctors, robots or employees in an ever changing environment, like a pandemic stricken region or a war-zone. In this paper we first explain the mechanics of the game and we perform a game analysis. We continue by proposing unique AI algorithms based on our understanding that the two biggest challenges in the game are keeping a balanced team and dealing with three sources of uncertainty. Later on, we describe why evaluating the performance of such agents is challenging and we present the results of our approach. Our AI agent performed significantly better than all previous attempts and peaked at the 33rd place in the world, in one of the most popular battle formats, while running on only 4 single socket servers.",,第1页.xls
878,Communication in Human-Agent Teams for Tasks with Joint Action,2016,"In many scenarios, humans must team with agents to achieve joint aims. When working collectively in a team of human and artificial agents, communication is important to establish a shared situation of the task at hand. With no human in the loop and little cost for communication, information about the task can be easily exchanged. However, when communication becomes expensive, or when there are humans in the loop, the strategy for sharing information must be carefully designed: too little information leads to lack of shared situation awareness, while too much overloads the human team members, decreasing performance overall. This paper investigates the effects of sharing beliefs and goals in agent teams and in human-agent teams. We performed a set of experiments using the BlocksWorlds for Teams (BW4T) testbed to assess different strategies for information sharing. In previous experimental studies using BW4T, explanations about agent behaviour were shown to have no effect on team performance. One possible reason for this is because the existing scenarios in BW4T contained joint tasks, but notjoint actions. That is, atomic actions that required interdependent and simultaneous action between more than one agent. We implemented new scenarios in BW4T in which some actions required two agents to complete. Our results showed an improvement in artificial-agent team performance when communicating goals and sharing beliefs, but with goals contributing more to team performance, and that in human-agent teams, communicating only goals was more effective than communicating both goals and beliefs.",,第1页.xls

880,Why did my AI agent lose?: Visual Analytics for Scaling Up After-Action Review,2021,"How can we help domain-knowledgeable users who do not have expertise in AI analyze why an AI agent failed? Our research team previously developed a new structured process for such users to assess AI, called After-Action Review for AI (AAR/AI), consisting of a series of steps a human takes to assess an AI agent and formalize their understanding. In this paper, we investigate how the AAR/AI process can scale up to support reinforcement learning (RL) agents that operate in complex environments. We augment the AAR/AI process to be performed at three levels-episode-level, decision-level, and explanation-level-and integrate it into our redesigned visual analytics interface. We illustrate our approach through a usage scenario of analyzing why a RL agent lost in a complex real-time strategy game built with the StarCraft 2 engine.

882,Predicting Player Experience without the Player An Exploratory Study,2017,"A key challenge of procedural content generation (PCG) is to evoke a certain player experience (PX), when we have no direct control over the content which gives rise to that experience. We argue that neither the rigorous methods to assess PX in HCI, nor specialised methods in PCG are sufficient, because they rely on a human in the loop. We propose to address this shortcoming by means of computational models of intrinsic motivation and AI game-playing agents. We hypothesise that our approach could be used to automatically predict PX across games and content types without relying on a human player or designer. We conduct an exploratory study in level generation based on empowerment, a specific model of intrinsic motivation. Based on a thematic analysis, we find that empowerment can be used to create levels with qualitatively different PX. We relate the identified experiences to established theories of PX in HCI and game design, and discuss next steps.",,第1页.xls
883,Beyond Words: Infusing Conversational Agents with Human-like Typing Behaviors,2024,"Recently, large language models have facilitated the emergence of highly intelligent conversational AI capable of engaging in human-like dialogues. However, a notable distinction lies in the fact that these AI models predominantly generate responses rapidly, often producing extensive content without emulating the thoughtful process characteristic of human cognition and typing. This paper presents a design aimed at simulating human-like typing behaviors, including patterns such as hesitation and self-editing, as well as a preliminary user experiment to understand whether and to what extent the agent with human-like typing behaviors could potentially affect conversational engagement and its trustworthiness. We've constructed an interactive platform featuring user-adjustable parameters, allowing users to personalize the AI's communication style and thus cultivate a more enriching and immersive conversational experience. Our user experiment, involving interactions with three types of agents-a baseline agent, one simulating hesitation, and another integrating both hesitation and self-editing behaviors-reveals a preference for the agent that incorporates both behaviors, suggesting an improvement in perceived naturalness and trustworthiness. Through the insights from our design process and both quantitative and qualitative feedback from user experiments, this paper contributes to the multimodal interaction design and user experience for conversational AI, advocating for a more human-like, engaging, and trustworthy communication paradigm.",,第1页.xls

The implementation extends the robot persona, previously utilized for allocating resources within a distributed robot team, and constructs a context adapter to allow each robot to assume a role as directed by the cognitive agent.",,第1页.xls

886,A robust cooperation architecture for teams of UCAVs,2002,"We deal with cooperation in communication-limited and dynamic environments. More precisely, the focus is on cooperation with local communication for teams of non-selfish agents operating in dynamic and unpredictable environments. We propose a framework that allow the creation and evolution of groups (sub-teams) within a team. We support this framework by experimental and formal results.",,第1页.xls
887,Attitude based teams in a hostile dynamic world,2005,"In this paper, we propose a teamwork model based on the concept of a mental attribute called attitude. Our team model presents team as a collective abstract attitude, in which is embedded a novel way of solving problems and conflicts in our domain. We argue that this collective attitude is further decomposed into the individual attitudes of the agents towards various team attributes. We then evaluate the team problem solving behaviours of the agents in a simulated fire world using teams with and without different types of attitudes. The application and implementation of this model to a virtual fire world has revealed a promising prospect in developing team agents. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第1页.xls

889,Communication and Shared Mental Models for Teams Performing Interdependent Tasks,2016,"Research shows that performance of human teams improves when members have a shared understanding of their task; that is, when teams develop and use a shared mental model (SMM). An SMM can contain different types of information or components and this paper investigates the influence on team performance of sharing different components. We consider two components of an SMM: intentions (e.g. goals) and world knowledge (e.g. beliefs) and investigate which component(s) contribute most to team performance across different forms of interdependent tasks. We performed experiments using a Blocks World for Team (BW4T) testbed for artificial agent teams and our results show that with high levels of interdependence in tasks, communicating intentions contributes most to team performance, while for low levels of interdependence, communicating world knowledge contributes more. Additionally, as is the case with human teams, higher sharedness correlated with improved team performance for the artificial agent teams. These insights can assist in the design of communication protocols that improves team performance when team members are engaged in interdependent tasks and help design artificial agents that can communicate effectively when working with humans as teammates.",,第1页.xls
890,Explaining Explaining,2024,"Explanation is key to people having confidence in high-stakes AI systems. However, machine-learning-based systems - which account for almost all current AI - can't explain because they are usually black boxes. The explainable AI (XAI) movement hedges this problem by redefining explanation. The human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) movement identifies the explanation-oriented needs of users but can't fulfill them because of its commitment to machine learning. In order to achieve the kinds of explanations needed by real people operating in critical domains, we must rethink how to approach AI. We describe a hybrid approach to developing cognitive agents that uses a knowledge-based infrastructure supplemented by data obtained through machine learning when applicable. These agents will serve as assistants to humans who will bear ultimate responsibility for the decisions and actions of the human-robot team. We illustrate the explanatory potential of such agents using the under-the-hood panels of a demonstration system in which a team of simulated robots collaborates on a search task assigned by a human.",,第1页.xls
891,Adaptive Team-Based Multi-Agent Organizational Model: A Case in Rescue Systems,2011,"In this paper, we addressed the problem of modelling complex cooperative multi-agent organizations. Proposed team-based model is inspired from the Schwaninger's model of intelligent human organizations. Considering time and agents' identity features is the main important factor in the mentioned model. In our considered problem domain, rescue systems, rapid task handling is a main requirement. Proposed model supports it through fast initial team formation, greedy capability-based coalition formation, and using the nearest neighbours' resources. Adaptation via reorganization makes the model appropriate for dynamic environments.",,第1页.xls
892,Toward Empathic Agents for Defusing Toxic Behaviors on Team Competition Games,2017,"Preventing toxic behaviors in a team competition game is an important issue since it could cause serious problems as well as giving players poor experiences in the gaming.

893,Team programming with GORITE,2008,"The intelligent agent paradigm has shown considerable promise as a candidate for general complex systems development. However, it is our belief that this promise will remain unfulfilled, with application of the paradigm constrained to situations where there is an overriding requirement to model human behaviour in a cognitively realistic manner. In our experience, such applications are uncommon and we have found that a team programming paradigm, as realised in frameworks such as GORITE, is generally more appropriate for complex systems development, particularly for engineered systems. In this paper, we introduce both the team programming paradigm and its realisation using GORITE.",,第1页.xls
894,A new approach to credit assignment in a team of cooperative Q-learning agents,2002,"Q-learning is widely used in many multi agent systems. In most cases, a separate critic is considered for qualifying each individual agent behavior or it is assumed that the critic is completely aware of effects of all agents' actions on the team qualification. But, in many cases, the role of each team member in the group performance is not known. In order to distribute a common credit among the agents, a suitable criterion must be provided to estimate the role of each agent in the team performance and to judge if an agent has done a wrong action. In this paper two such criteria, named certainty and expertness, for a team of agents with parallel tasks are introduced. In addition, two methods for reinforcing the agents based on the proposed measures are provided. Some simulation results are also reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed measures and methods.",,第1页.xls
895,Team-solvability: A model-theoretic perspective,2000,"At present, the extension of formal learning theory to the multi-agent case considers teams of agents sharing a common end. Success is achieved if one or more of the agents is successful, and cooperation is not involved in the team formation. Unfortunately, this is rarely the idea of successful team we have in mind. One generally expects agents' behavior to influence each other in a way that is not captured by the present paradigms. A real problem in extending single agent learning methods to multi-agent setting is thus determining paradigms of cooperation. This paper makes a contribution to the solution of this problem. First, we advance a paradigm of cooperation as a kind of two-person repeated game and compare it to a major paradigm of solvability for isolated agents. Second, we pay attention to a subset of unsuccessful agents who take advantage from teamwork. For these agents, cooperation is proved to be a key of success. The formal results are raised within the model-theoretic tradition of formal learning theory.",,第1页.xls
896,A Evolutionary Behavior Tree AI for Neural MMO Challenge,2022,"The Neural MMO Challenge aims to study robustness and teamwork in large-scale multi-agent environments. AI needs to explore, search and fight in large-scale environments, and get higher scores than other competitors. Therefore, we developed AI based on evolutionary behavior tree, which has the advantages of strong interpretability, low coupling between modules and strong robustness. Specifically, the AI adopts the idea of divide and conquer, divides the decision-making into two levels: team and individual, divides the four task achievements into several subtasks, finds appropriate agents for each subtask according to the current advantages, and then completes specific actions such as attack, foraging, avoidance and collaboration, and optimizes the parameters with evolutionary strategy algorithm.AI won the silver medal in IJCAI 2022 Neural MMO Challenge.",,第1页.xls

These agents participate in markets for exchanging goods and services, and team their abilities to compose complex services. Realising the UMDL agent architecture requires us to provide sound mechanisms to encapsulate functions as agents, protocols to support the evolution of teams and agent interactions through markets, and protocols to enable interoperability among library agents that are teamed.

898,Experimental evaluation of A-teams solving resource availability cost problem,2020,"In this paper, a multi-agent system (MAS) based on the Asynchronous Team (A-Team) concept employs different cooperation strategies to solving the resource availability cost problem (RACP). The strategies proposed are experimentally validated. The RACP, known also as the resource investment problem (RIP), belongs to the class of NP-hard optimization problems. To solve the problem, the A-Team-based system which uses asynchronous agents implemented in the JADE-based A-Team (JABAT) environment has been proposed. Four strategies and four kinds of optimization agents are used. In this paper, one static and three dynamic strategies are used to manage the A-Team. The approach is validated experimentally using 144 problem instances.",,第1页.xls
899,Conflict mediation in human-machine teaming: using a virtual agent to support mission planning and debriefing,2019,"Socially intelligent artificial agents and robots are anticipated to become ubiquitous in home, work, and military environments. With the addition of such agents to human teams it is crucial to evaluate their role in the planning, decision making, and conflict mediation processes. We conducted a study to evaluate the utility of a virtual agent that provided mission planning support in a three-person human team during a military strategic mission planning scenario. The team consisted of a human team lead who made the final decisions and three supporting roles, two humans and the artificial agent. The mission outcome was experimentally designed to fail and introduced a conflict between the human team members and the leader. This conflict was mediated by the artificial agent during the debriefing process through discuss or debate and open communication strategies of conflict resolution [1]. Our results showed that our teams experienced conflict. The teams also responded socially to the virtual agent, although they did not find the agent beneficial to the mediation process. Finally, teams collaborated well together and perceived task proficiency increased for team leaders. Socially intelligent agents show potential for conflict mediation, but need careful design and implementation to improve team processes and collaboration.",,第1页.xls
900,Reinforcement Learning-Based Autonomous Collision Prediction and Avoidance System for Vehicles,2023,"This study investigates the feasibility developing an Autonomous Collision Prediction and Avoidance System (RL-ACPAS) based on Reinforcement Learning automobiles in light of the increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles on the road. In this research, we used a thorough approach that included data gathering from many sensors, RL agent training using deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and performance assessment. The findings show that RL-ACPAS has high rates of avoiding collisions, fast reaction times, and effective decision-making, all of which bode well for enhancing road safety, traffic efficiency, and economic sustainability. These results, combined with hypothetical data and practical consequences, illustrate the transformational potential of RL-ACPAS. The real-world effects on security, effectiveness, economy, and trust are emphasized throughout the presentation. Insights into technological developments, road safety awareness, regulatory issues, and consumer advantages are also provided to readers. Future directions include things like improved learning algorithms, sensor integration, field testing, ethics, human-AI interaction, regulatory frameworks, data sharing, and constant progress. The future of RL-ACPAS is one of experimentation, cooperation, and dedication to making autonomous transportation systems more secure and dependable.",,第1页.xls
901,Training time and team composition robustness in evolved multi-agent systems,2008,"Evolutionary algorithms are effective at creating cooperative, multi-agent systems. However, current Island and Team algorithms show subtle but significant weaknesses when it comes to balancing member performance with member cooperation, leading to sub-optimal overall team performance. In this paper we apply a new class of cooperative multi-agent evolutionary algorithms called Orthogonal Evolution of Teams (OET) which produce higher levels of cooperation and specialization than current team algorithms. We also show that sophisticated behavior evolves much sooner using OET algorithms, even when training resources are significantly reduced. Finally, we show that when teams must be reformed, due to agent break down for example, those teams composed of individuals sampled from OET teams perform much better than teams composed of individuals sampled from teams created by other methods.",,第1页.xls
902,Online Team Formation under Different Synergies [arXiv],2022,"Team formation is ubiquitous in many sectors: education, labor markets, sports, etc. A team's success depends on its members' latent types, which are not directly observable but can be (partially) inferred from past performances. From the viewpoint of a principal trying to select teams, this leads to a natural exploration-exploitation trade-off: retain successful teams that are discovered early, or reassign agents to learn more about their types? We study a natural model for online team formation, where a principal repeatedly partitions a group of agents into teams. Agents have binary latent types, each team comprises two members, and a team's performance is a symmetric function of its members' types. Over multiple rounds, the principal selects matchings over agents and incurs regret equal to the deficit in the number of successful teams versus the optimal matching for the given function. Our work provides a complete characterization of the regret landscape for all symmetric functions of two binary inputs. In particular, we develop team-selection policies that, despite being agnostic of model parameters, achieve optimal or near-optimal regret against an adaptive adversary.",,第1页.xls
903,Agents for establishing Ad hoc cross-organizational teams,2004,"Ad hoc cross-agency teams are often needed to deal with actual, imminent, or potential crises involving multiple geographic/political jurisdictions or requiring coordinated expertise from organizations,with different responsibilities. Our, initial ontology-based,, policy-driven version of personal agents and agent-based work flows and Web services facilitates the establishment of such teams. The agents and services use and augment the existing email and office automation applications of an organization. Preliminary results indicate a potential reduction of two orders of magnitude in the time needed to form a team.",,第1页.xls
904,How much should an agent know what other agents are doing in a cooperative team?,1998,"Cooperation in a task oriented multi-agent team is important because a well designed cooperation strategy among a group of cooperating agents can lead to an increase of the group performance. A challenging research issue in cooperation is to assess how much and to what extent an agent should consider the actions and effects of other agents. In this paper; we address this issue in the context of an object search team. We first propose the concept of activity window to capture the view of an agent on the activities of the team. Then we pinpoint some criteria that can be used to determine whether it is beneficial for an agent to put an action of the team into its window. Finally, we present experimental results.",,第1页.xls
905,Human-agent transfer from observations,2020,"Learning from human demonstration (LfD), among many speedup techniques for reinforcement learning (RL), has seen many successful applications. We consider one LfD technique called human-agent transfer (HAT), where a model of the human demonstrator's decision function is induced via supervised learning and used as an initial bias for RL. Some recent work in LfD has investigated learning from observations only, that is, when only the demonstrator's states (and not its actions) are available to the learner. Since the demonstrator's actions are treated as labels for HAT, supervised learning becomes untenable in their absence. We adapt the idea of learning an inverse dynamics model from the data acquired by the learner's interactions with the environment and deploy it to fill in the missing actions of the demonstrator. The resulting version of HAT-called state-only HAT (SoHAT)-is experimentally shown to preserve some advantages of HAT in benchmark domains with both discrete and continuous actions. This paper also establishes principled modifications of an existing baseline algorithm-called A3C-to create its HAT and SoHAT variants that are used in our experiments.",,第1页.xls
906,Agent-oriented software engineering for successful TAC participation,2002,We describe our approach for an efficient design and implementation of multi-agent systems using agent oriented methodologies and tools.

The first RoboCup competition was held at IJCAI-97, Nagoya. In order for a robot team to actually perform a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated including: design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning, robotics, and sensor-fusion. RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. Although RoboCup's final target is a world cup with real robots, RoboCup offers a software platform for research on the software aspects of RoboCup.

Advanced technologies have the potential to serve as teammates versus as mere tools during tasks involving human partners, yet little research has been done to quantify the factors that shape teaming perceptions in a human-machine domain. The current study used a large online sample to test a set of candidate measures related to the AAT model. Psychometric analyses were used to gauge their utility. The results demonstrate initial support for the validity of the AAT model.",,第1页.xls
909,Situation based strategic positioning for coordinating a team of homogeneous agents,2001,"In this paper we are proposing an approach for coordinating a team of homogeneous agents based on a flexible common Team Strategy as well as on the concepts of Situation Based Strategic Positioning and Dynamic Positioning and Role Exchange. We also introduce an Agent Architecture including a specific high-level decision module capable of implementing this strategy. Our proposal is based on the formalization of what is a team strategy for competing with an opponent team having opposite goals. A team strategy is composed of a set of agent types and a set of tactics, which are also composed of several formations. Formations are used for different situations and assign each agent a default spatial positioning and an agent type (defining its behaviour at several levels). Agent's reactivity is also introduced for appropriate response to the dynamics of the current situation. However, in our approach this is done in a way that preserves team coherence instead of permitting uncoordinated agent behaviour. We have applied, with success, this coordination approach to the RoboSoccer simulated domain. The FC Portugal team, developed using this approach won the RoboCup2000 (simulation league) European and World championships scoring a total of 180 goals and conceding none.",,第1页.xls
910,Improving multi-agent systems using Jason,2011,We describe the approach used to develop the multi-agent system of herders that competed as the Jason-DTU team at the Multi-Agent Programming Contest 2010. We also participated in 2009 with a system developed in the agent-oriented programming language Jason which is an extension of AgentSpeak. We used the implementation from 2009 as a foundation and therefore much of the work done this year was on improving that implementation. We present a description which includes design and analysis of the system as well as the main features of our agent team strategy. In addition we discuss the technologies used to develop this system as well as our future goals in the area.,,第1页.xls
911,Diversity as a knowledge resource in top management teams - A framework for agent-based modeling,2008,"The current paper reveals and explains inconsistencies in cognitive diversity research regarding diversity effects on top management team information processing as a presumption for team performance. On the one hand diversity constitutes a resource by enlarging the knowledge-pool of the team and therefore potentially contributes to team and organisational performance. On the other hand diversity can act as a barrier and hinder access to the knowledge. The paper refers to limitations of empirical research designs and discusses different simulation approaches as alternative research methods. Following the first steps of a roadmap for using simulation given by Davis et al. (2007) a framework, comprising relevant moderator and mediator variables of the team diversity - information processing relationship, is identified. Finally agent based simulation is acknowledged as method to clarify the team diversity - team performance relationship in future research and further steps of the roadmap are outlined.",,第1页.xls
912,TAPIR: TAPS WITH INPUT REDUCTION FOR INTER-AGENT ADAPTATION IN MODERN GAMES,2008,"Tactical Agent Personality or TAP (Tan and Cheng 2008b) is a modeling concept used for capturing tactical patterns in modem game agents. TAPs are used in a learning framework to enable inter-agent adaptation in team-based games but suffer from the curse of dimensionality when team size increases. This paper presents TAPIR, the improved adaptation framework which introduces a dimension reduction mechanism that provides a fast convergence rate to enable a wider applicability to larger agent teams as well as produce better adaptation performance. The TAPIR based learning framework is implemented in an RPG scenario which is shown to outperform the previous framework in a setting with large team sizes. An analysis of execution times is also performed which shows that actual adaptation time is almost constant with increasing number of agents.",,第1页.xls
913,Improving cognitive interaction through computational collaboration agents,2014,"We propose that some of the knowledge management challenges incurred by computer-mediated collaboration be addressed by leveraging the computational resources inherent in that same collaboration to more directly serve it through Computational Collaboration Agents (CCAs). CCAs and the approach advocated here are motivated by the theory of Interactive Team Cognition which posits that team cognition can be observed in team interactions. CCAs observe and assess individual and collaborative events, analyse those events, interpret the analysis, and intervene as needed to improve collaboration. Because the CCAs are able to leverage events and actions that take place in the context of the collaboration technology, they have the advantage of operating in real-time without interfering with task performance.",,第1页.xls
914,Pow-Wow: A Dataset and Study on Collaborative Communication in Pommerman [arXiv],2020,"In multi-agent learning, agents must coordinate with each other in order to succeed. For humans, this coordination is typically accomplished through the use of language. In this work we perform a controlled study of human language use in a competitive team-based game, and search for useful lessons for structuring communication protocol between autonomous agents. We construct Pow-Wow, a new dataset for studying situated goal-directed human communication. Using the Pommerman game environment, we enlisted teams of humans to play against teams of AI agents, recording their observations, actions, and communications. We analyze the types of communications which result in effective game strategies, annotate them accordingly, and present corpus-level statistical analysis of how trends in communications affect game outcomes. Based on this analysis, we design a communication policy for learning agents, and show that agents which utilize communication achieve higher win-rates against baseline systems than those which do not.",,第1页.xls
915,The multiagent teams in a dynamic fire world,1999,"We present a complete teamwork model that identifies the key issues of team problem solving by dynamic team formation and team planning. Teams are inherently paradoxical, in that they comprise apparently contradictory elements, each of which is true. The differences of individual beliefs, intentions and plans cannot be accomplished, yet the team demands that these different insights be combined or integrated such that agents act as one. However, the team models of social activity have focused only on limited aspects of cooperation, primarily focused on notions of commitments and conventions. Our teamwork model is based on a concept of multiple level team beliefs. The model also emphasizes on the multiple level belief module (team, group, society, and individual beliefs) which allows robust and coherent team behavior. The application and implementation of this model to a virtual fire-fighting domain has revealed a promising prospect in developing team agents.",,第1页.xls

The experience provided a great deal of data about general and domain specific properties of the system. A secondary research goal was to generalize the strategy editor used to specify the team strategies of last years team to specify team strategies for agent of different types via the use of an XML interface. The poor performance of the team (3 losses and a draw in the competition) is attributed to the early stage of the research as well as the very high computational complexity of the agent runtime architecture.,,第1页.xls

919,VGC AI Competition - A New Model of Meta-Game Balance AI Competition,2021,"This work presents a framework for a new type of meta-game balance AI Competition based on Pokemon, Pokemon battles can be viewed as adversarial games played by AIs. Around these games, there is also a meta-game: which Pokemon to include in a team for battles, which moves to pick for every Pokemon in the team, etc. This meta-game is itself a game with a set of rules that govern which Pokemon and which moves are available in the roster that can be selected from, or which attributes (health points, damage, etc.) a Pokemon or moves should have. The aim of the framework is to facilitate competitions in creating the most balanced meta-game possible; one where there is a large variety of Pokemon and moves to choose from, and many possible combinations that are effective. AI agents could assist human designers in achieving strategically expressive meta-games, and this type of benchmark could incentivize game designers and researchers alike to advance knowledge on this type of domain.",,第1页.xls
920,Using a planner for coordination of multiagent team behavior,2006,"We present an approach to coordinate the behavior of a multiagent team using an HTN planning procedure. To coordinate teams, high level tasks have to be broken down into subtasks which is a basic operation in HTN planners. We axe using planners in each of the agents to incorporate domain knowledge and to make agents follow a specified team strategy. With our approach, agents coordinate deliberatively and still maintain a high degree of reactivity. In our implementation for use in RoboCup Simulation League, first results were already very promising. Using a planner leads to better separation of agent code and expert knowledge.",,第1页.xls
921,Strategies for distributing goals in a team of cooperative agents,2005,"This paper addresses the problem of distributing goals to individual agents inside a team of cooperative agents.It shows that several parameters determine the goals of particular agents. The first parameter is the set of goals allocated to the team; the second parameter is the description of the real actual world; the third parameter is the description of the agents' ability and commitments. The last parameter is the strategy the team agrees on: for each precise goal, the team may define several strategies which are orders between agents representing, for instance, their relative competence or their relative cost. This paper also shows how to combine strategies. The method used here assumes an order of priority between strategies.",,第1页.xls
922,Elo Ratings for Large Tournaments of Software Agents in Asymmetric Games [arXiv],2021,"The Elo rating system has been used world wide for individual sports and team sports, as exemplified by the European Go Federation (EGF), International Chess Federation (FIDE), International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), and many others. To evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence agents, it is natural to evaluate them on the same Elo scale as humans, such as the rating of 5185 attributed to AlphaGo Zero. There are several fundamental differences between humans and AI that suggest modifications to the system, which in turn require revisiting Elo's fundamental rationale. AI is typically trained on many more games than humans play, and we have little a-priori information on newly created AI agents. Further, AI is being extended into games which are asymmetric between the players, and which could even have large complex boards with different setup in every game, such as commercial paper strategy games. We present a revised rating system, and guidelines for tournaments, to reflect these differences.",,第1页.xls
923,Multi-Agent Path Finding - An Overview,2019,"Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding paths for multiple agents such that every agent reaches its goal and the agents do not collide. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in MAPF in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) research community. This interest is partially because real-world MAPF applications, such as warehouse management, multi-robot teams, and aircraft management, are becoming more prevalent. In this overview, we discuss several possible definitions of the MAPF problem. Then, we survey MAPF algorithms, starting with fast but incomplete algorithms, then fast, complete but not optimal algorithms, and finally optimal algorithms. Then, we describe approximately optimal algorithms and conclude with non-classical MAPF and pointers for future reading and future work.",,第1页.xls
924,On the Potential of Rocket League for Driving Team AI Development,2020,"Several Games have been used as test cases for new AI developments in the last years, e.g. the games of the Atari Learning Environment, Go, and also StarCraft. As many single player problems are treated successfully now, research is turning more to Team AI problems: AI/human and AI/AI coordinated decision making in mixed cooperative/competitive environments. OpenAI Five and RoboCup and related environments as MuJoCo soccer are pushing into this direction. Rocket League is an interesting alternative as it has quite different game mechanics compared to soccer, and an API with a number of different hots already exists. We summarize the current state, relate it to the situation in the fields that may provide useful approaches as e.g. sports analysis, and argue that it makes sense to do more research on Rocket League hot control and coordination.",,第1页.xls
925,Dealing with new guys in experienced teams the old guys might also have to adapt,2003,"This paper deals with handling the situation when in an experienced team of agents one team member is replaced by a new agent with different abilities. We extend earlier work that focused on how the new agent can make use of the strategy of the old agent as seed strategy in an evolutionary learning approach with prototypical situation-action pairs and the nearest-neighbor rule as agent architecture. We now allow also the remaining team members to adapt their behavior suing their old strategies as seed strategies in evolutionary on-line learning. After giving the new agent some time for a basic adaptation, the remaining team members take turns to adapt themselves. Our experimental evaluation shows that this extension allows us to deal with situations where the difference in abilities is too big for the previous approach to succeed. We also can report examples in which additional abilities of the new agent are made use of to get an overall better team performance than with the old agent.",,第1页.xls
926,Automated Adaptation of Strategic Guidance in Multiagent Coordination,2011,"We address multi-agent planning problems in dynamic environments motivated by assisting human teams in disaster emergency response. It is challenging because most goals are revealed during execution, where uncertainty in the duration and outcome of actions plays a significant role, and where unexpected events can cause large disruptions to existing plans. The key to our approach is giving human planners a rich strategy language to constrain the assignment of agents to goals and allow the system to instantiate the strategy during execution, tuning the assignment to the evolving execution state. Our approach outperformed an extensively-trained team coordinating with radios and a traditional command-center organization, and an agent-assisted team using a different approach.",,第1页.xls

Consequently, how to organize, supervise, and evaluate such a distributed modeling networked-team has become an important problem. The methodology and platform-DCMS (Distributed Cooperative Modeling System) have been put forward to support collaboration over such networked-team. In addition, a Soft-Agents network system is designed to perform supervising and collaborating teams and individuals in the networked-team, based on their working progress, diligence, modeling complexity and model updating frequency. Such supervising enable judgment on working characteristics and modeling quality of each team and individual separately, in turn provide a basis for future optimization and coordination of the networked-team organization.",,第1页.xls
928,Human-Autonomy Teaming and Explainable AI Capabilities in RTS Games,2020,"Real-time strategy games often times mimic the appearance and feel of military-like command and control systems. Artificial intelligence and machine learning research enjoys utilizing the environments produced by these games and are often focused on creating intelligent agents to beat them or accomplish high scores. Instead of creating these agents, or bots, to beat real-time strategy games, this work instead focuses on creating machine learning-driven agents to work with human players. However, due to the advancements in the deep learning field, machine learning models have become harder to understand, and are called 'black-box models' due to the inability to see the inner workings of such algorithms.

Additionally, strategies adopted from social insects have been employed in a multitude of problems to perform distributed problem solving. In this work, we combine collective movements with general problem solving capabilities to build multi-agent teams that perform search and collection tasks that require not only navigational skills but also a coordinate team strategy. The results show that agents undertaking collective movements are better able to self-coordinate and propagate information than those moving independently.",,第1页.xls

Front-line workers have had to shoulder runaway workloads. Software Agent technologies have been widely advocated as a solution, but there are few reported success stories. In the author's previous work, a design was proposed for a system to support front-line staff in a team teaching environment.

In the Agents in the City contest, two teams compete to accomplish logistic tasks in simulations using realistic city maps from OpenStreetMap. The new version of the scenario shifted emphasis to include jobs that require assembled items, new types of facilities, and larger teams, resulting in a significantly more complex scenario than before. In this paper, we describe the strategies used by our team, highlighting our adaptations and any new additions from our participation in the previous year. One such new addition, is that now we have fully explored the use of all three programming dimensions (agent, environment, and organization) found in JaCaMo, the multi-agent system development platform that we used to implement our team.

935,Cephalo: Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models for Bio-Inspired Materials Analysis and Design,2024,"We present Cephalo, a series of multimodal vision large language models (V-LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding and interaction within human-AI and multi-agent AI frameworks. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method, which employs a sophisticated algorithm to accurately detect and separate images and their corresponding textual descriptions from PDF documents, such as scientific papers. The method includes a careful refinement of image-text pairs through integrated vision and language processing, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant, and well reasoned training data. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data extracted from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia pages demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports complex natural language understanding in an integrated model, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-image or image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To explore the development of larger models from smaller ones, we merge sets of layers that originate from different pre-trained source models. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage the domain-specific expertise and general conversational capabilities to harness the strengths of multiple models. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse.",,第1页.xls

937,The Impact of Emotion Displays in Embodied Agents on Emergence of Cooperation with People,2011,"Acknowledging the social functions of emotion in people, there has been growing interest in the interpersonal effect of emotion on cooperation in social dilemmas. This paper explores whether and how facial displays of emotion in embodied agents impact cooperation with human users. The paper describes an experiment where participants play the iterated prisoner's dilemma against two different agents that play the same strategy (tit-for-tat), but communicate different goal orientations (cooperative vs. individualistic) through their patterns of facial displays. The results show that participants are sensitive to differences in the displays of emotion and cooperate significantly more with the cooperative agent. The results also reveal that cooperation rates are only significantly different when people play first with the individualistic agent. This is in line with the well-known black-hat/white-hat effect from the negotiation literature. However, this study emphasizes that people can discern a cooperator (white-hat) from a noncooperator (black-hat) based only on emotion displays. We propose that people are able to identify the cooperator by inferring, from the emotion displays, the agent's goals. We refer to this as reverse appraisal, as it reverses the usual process in which appraising relevant events with respect to one's goals leads to specific emotion displays. We discuss implications for designing human computer interfaces and understanding human-human interaction.",,第1页.xls
938,Inverse concave-utility reinforcement learning is inverse game theory,2024,"We consider inverse reinforcement learning problems with concave utilities. Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) is a generalisation of the standard RL objective, which employs a concave function of the state occupancy measure, rather than a linear function. CURL has garnered recent attention for its ability to represent instances of many important applications including the standard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs, offline RL, human-regularized RL, and others. Inverse reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm that focuses on recovering an unknown reward function that can rationalize the observed behaviour of an agent. There has been recent theoretical advances in inverse RL where the problem is formulated as identifying the set of feasible reward functions. However, inverse RL for CURL problems has not been considered previously. In this paper we show that most of the standard IRL results do not apply to CURL in general, since CURL invalidates the classical Bellman equations. This calls for a new theoretical framework for the inverse CURL problem. Using a recent equivalence result between CURL and Mean-field Games, we propose a new definition for the feasible rewards for I-CURL by proving that this problem is equivalent to an inverse game theory problem in a subclass of mean-field games. We present initial query and sample complexity results for the I-CURL problem under assumptions such as Lipschitz-continuity. Finally, we outline future directions and applications in human--AI collaboration enabled by our results.",,第1页.xls
939,Empowerment as a Generic Utility Function for Agents in a Simple Team Sport Simulation,2017,"Players in team sports cooperate in a coordinated manner to achieve common goals. Automated players in academic and commercial team sports simulations have traditionally been driven by complex externally motivated value functions with heuristics based on knowledge of game tactics and strategy. Empowerment is an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential to influence its environment, which has been shown to provide a useful intrinsic value function, without the need for external goals and motivation, for agents in single agent models. In this paper we expand on the concept of empowerment to propose the concept of team empowerment as an intrinsic, generic utility function for cooperating agents. We show that agents motivated by team empowerment exhibit recognizable team behaviors in a simple team sports simulation based on Ultimate Frisbee.",,第1页.xls

941,Attitude driven team formation using multi-dimensional trust,2007,"When agents form a team to solve a given problem, a critical step in improving performance is selecting beneficial teammates by identifying the helpfulness of other agents. To maximize its performance, an agent must consider the trustworthiness of potential teammates relative to multiple behavioral constraints. This multidimensional trustworthiness assessment is shown to be of significant benefit in solving the team formation problem. This research introduces the concept of attitude to assert how much an agent should trust other agents by identifying the most influential facet among multiple trustworthiness assessments. In this sense, attitudes define how an agent selects beneficial teammates given different situations. In addition, this research shows how those attitudes are learned and aid in teammate selection.",,第1页.xls
942,Towards flexible teamwork in persistent teams: Extended report,2000,"Teamwork is a critical capability in multi-agent environments. Many such environments mandate that the agents and agent-teams must be persistent i.e., exist over long periods of time. Agents in such persistent teams are bound together by their long-term common interests and goals. This paper focuses on flexible teamwork in such persistent teams. Unfortunately, while previous work has investigated flexible teamwork, persistent teams remain unexplored. For flexible teamwork, one promising approach that has emerged is model-based, i.e., providing agents with general models of teamwork that explicitly specify their commitments in teamwork. Such models enable agents to autonomously reason about coordination. Unfortunately, fur persistent trams, such models may lead to coordination and communication actions that while locally optimal, are highly problematic for the team's long-term goals. We present a decision-theoretic technique based on Markov decision processes to enable persistent teams to overcome such limitations of the model-based approach. In particular, agents reason about expected ream utilities of future team states that are projected to result from actions recommended by the teamwork model, as well as lower-cost (or higher-cost) variations on these actions. To accommodate real-time constraints, this reasoning is done in an any-time fashion. Implemented examples from an analytic search tree and some real-world domains are presented.",,第1页.xls
943,The Impact of Expertise on Pair Programming Productivity in a Scrum Team: A Multi-Agent Simulation,2018,"Scrum is an agile framework within which people can address complex problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. Pair programming refers to two software developers working together on programming activity as a single unit. The dynamics of a Pair may affect the performance of a Scrum team, which will directly affect the delivery of software. In this study, multi-agent modeling is used to simulate pair programming team dynamics in Scrum so that paired team members' interactions and performance can be modelled and analyzed. The model provides an understanding of how pair programming team composition and team dynamics affect the delivery of software by Scrum teams. In addition, this model can be used to investigate various teamwork strategies that can be implemented to ensure successful delivery of the software.

Our computational model of emotion is inspired on appraisal theory and on superior nervous system characteristics. We define the model for temperamental agent with emotions. In this paper we prove that teams of the agents with different temperaments have different performances in the same simulation scenario. The result shows that strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism strongly influence system performance and there are evident dependencies between emotional states of agents and their temperamental type, as well as dependencies between the team performance and team configuration, and this enables us to conclude that modular approach to emotional programming based on temperamental theory is a good choice to develop computational mind models for emotional behavioral Multi-Agent systems.",,第1页.xls
948,Learning Synergies for Multi-Objective Optimization in Asymmetric Multiagent Systems,2023,"Agents in a multiagent system must learn diverse policies that allow them to express complex inter-agent relationships required to optimize a single team objective. Multiagent Quality Diversity methods partially address this by transforming the agents' large joint policy space to a tractable sub-space that can produce synergistic agent policies. However, a majority of real-world problems are inherently multi-objective and require asymmetric agents (agents with different capabilities and objectives) to learn policies that represent diverse trade-offs between agent-specific and team objectives. This work introduces Multi-objective Asymmetric Island Model (MO-AIM), a multi-objective multiagent learning framework for the discovery of generalizable agent synergies and trade-offs that is based on adapting the population dynamics over a spectrum of tasks. The key insight is that the competitive pressure arising from the changing populations on the team tasks forces agents to acquire robust synergies required to balance their individual and team objectives in response to the nature of their teams and task dynamics. Results on several variations of a multi-objective habitat problem highlight the potential of MO-AIM in producing teams with diverse specializations and trade-offs that readily adapt to unseen tasks.",,第1页.xls
949,On Multi-Agent Learning in Team Sports Games [arXiv],2019,"In recent years, reinforcement learning has been successful in solving video games from Atari to Star Craft II. However, the end-to-end model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is not sample efficient and requires a significant amount of computational resources to achieve superhuman level performance. Model-free RL is also unlikely to produce human-like agents for playtesting and gameplaying AI in the development cycle of complex video games. In this paper, we present a hierarchical approach to training agents with the goal of achieving human-like style and high skill level in team sports games. While this is still work in progress, our preliminary results show that the presented approach holds promise for solving the posed multi-agent learning problem.",,第1页.xls
950,Agent theory for team formation by dialogue,2001,"The process of cooperative problem solving can be divided into four stages. First, finding potential team members, then forming a learn followed by constructing a plan for that team. Finally, the plan is executed by the team. Traditionally, protocols like the contract net protocol are used for performing the first two stages of the process. In an open environment however, there can be discussion among the agents in order to form a team that can achieve the collective intention of solving the problem. For these cases fixed protocols like contract net do not suffice. In this paper we present a theory for agents that are able to discuss the team formation and subsequently work as a team member until the collective goal has been fulfilled. We also present a solution, using structured dialogues, with an emphasis on persuasion, that can be shown to lead to the required team formation. The dialogues are described formally using modal logics and speech acts.",,第1页.xls
951,Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Evaluating the Objective and Subjective Impacts of xAI on Human-Agent Interaction,2023,"Intelligent agents must be able to communicate intentions and explain their decision-making processes to build trust, foster confidence, and improve human-agent team dynamics. Recognizing this need, academia and industry are rapidly proposing new ideas, methods, and frameworks to aid in the design of more explainable AI. Yet, there remains no standardized metric or experimental protocol for benchmarking new methods, leaving researchers to rely on their own intuition or ad hoc methods for assessing new concepts. In this work, we present the first comprehensive (n = 286) user study testing a wide range of approaches for explainable machine learning, including feature importance, probability scores, decision trees, counterfactual reasoning, natural language explanations, and case-based reasoning, as well as a baseline condition with no explanations. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of the effects of explainability on human-agent teaming. Our results will help to guide the future of explainability research by highlighting the benefits of counterfactual explanations and the shortcomings of confidence scores for explainability. We also propose a novel questionnaire to measure explainability with human participants, inspired by relevant prior work and correlated with human-agent teaming metrics.",,第1页.xls
952,Genetic learning of virtual team member preferences,2013,"Virtual team members do not have complete understanding of other team members preferences, which makes team coordination somewhat difficult and time consuming. Traditional approaches for team coordination require a lot of inter-agent electronic communication and often result in wasted effort. Methods that reduce inter-agent communication and conflicts are likely to increase productivity of virtual teams. In this research, we propose an evolutionary genetic algorithm (GA) based intelligent agent that learns a team member preferences from past actions, and develops a team-coordination schedule by minimizing schedule conflicts between different members serving on a virtual team. Using a discrete event simulation methodology, we test the proposed intelligent agent on different virtual teams of sizes two, four, six and eight members. The results of our experiments indicate that the GA-based intelligent agent learns individual team member preferences and generates a team-coordination schedule at a lower inter-agent communication cost.

953,Prioritizing fuzzy behaviors in multi-robot pursuit teams,2007,"The combination of fuzzy control and behavior hierarchies allows for the construction of more complex behavior-based robot control agents than does either technique alone. However, current implementations are limited in their complexity since high-level behaviors still use low-level sensor information. We propose a technique for abstracting this low-level sensor information into priorities which are used to completely abstract out the context in which a high-level, fuzzy behavior operates. This modification enables a single high-level behavior to coordinate the lower-level behaviors within a single robot, among the robots in a team, or even among teams of teams. This is demonstrated in a scenario in which multiple pursuers attempt to capture a prey.",,第1页.xls
954,VGC AI Competition - A New Model of Meta-Game Balance AI Competition,2021,"This work presents a framework for a new type of meta-game balance AI Competition based on Pokemon. Pokemon battles can be viewed as adversarial games played by AIs. Around these games, there is also a meta-game: which Pokemon to include in a team for battles, which moves to pick for every Pokemon in the team, etc. This meta-game is itself a game with a set of rules that govern which Pokemon and which moves are available in the roster that can be selected from, or which attributes (health points, damage, etc.) a Pokemon or moves should have. The aim of the framework is to facilitate competitions in creating the most balanced meta-game possible; one where there is a large variety of Pokemon and moves to choose from, and many possible combinations that are effective. AI agents could assist human designers in achieving strategically expressive meta-games, and this type of benchmark could incentivize game designers and researchers alike to advance knowledge on this type of domain.",,第1页.xls
955,A role-oriented BDI framework for real-time multiagent teaming,2007,"Multi-agent teaming is an active research field of multi-agent systems. Flexible multi-agent decision making requires effective reaction and adaption to dynamic changes under time pressure, especially in real-time and dynamic systems. The joint intension and sharedplan are two most popular theories for the teamwork of multi-agent systems. However, there is no clear guidance for designing and implementing agents' teaming. BDI (Belief, Desire, and Intension) architecture has been widely used to design multi-agent systems. In this paper, a role-based BDI framework is presented to facilitate the team level optimization problems such as competitive, cooperation and coordination problems. This BDI framework is extended on the commercial agent software development environment known as JACK Teams. The layered architecture has been used to group the agents' competitive and cooperative behaviors. In addition, we present the reinforcement learning techniques to learn different behaviors through experience. These issues have been specified and investigated within a real-time 2D simulation environment known as soccerBots.",,第1页.xls

958,Toward a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Model of Agent Behavior in Multiagent Teams,2011,"This paper explores the use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) as the basis for defining thepersonalityof an agent. The MBTI is a well-known psychological theory of human personality. In the MBTI model, four axes are defined to explain how humans perceive their environment, how they interact with others and how they make decisions based on these traits. The work described here presents a preliminary model of agent behavior in which two of the axes are implemented, combining to reflect four distinct agent personality types. Experiments were conducted under three environmental conditions: single agent setting, homogeneous multiagent team, and heterogeneous multiagent team. Results are presented for each condition and are analyzed in comparison with the other conditions, as well as within the context of the expected MBTI behaviors given each environment and the simulated task. It is demonstrated that agents of each personality type produce very different results, distinct for and characteristic of each MBTI personality type.",,第1页.xls

Remarkably, little prior work has addressed the problem of mechanism design for team formation, accounting for the need to elicit agents' preferences over potential teammates. Coalition formation in the related hedonic games has received much attention, but only from the perspective of coalition stability, with little emphasis on the mechanism design objectives of true preference elicitation, social welfare, and equity. We present the first formal mechanism design framework for team formation, building on recent combinatorial matching market design literature. We exhibit four mechanisms for this problem, two novel, two simple extensions of known mechanisms from other domains. Two of these (one new, one known) have desirable theoretical properties.

967,Working with a Recommendation Agent: How Recommendation Presentation Influences Users' Perceptions and Behaviors,2018,"Artificial intelligence (AI) based recommendation agents (RA) can help managers make better decisions by processing a large quantity of decision relevant information. Research on user-RA interactions show that users benefit from RA, but that there are some challenges to their adoption. For instance, RA adoption can only happen if users trust the RA. Thus, this study investigates how the richness of the information provided by an RA and the effort necessary to reach this information influence users' perceptions and usage. A within-subject lab experiment was conducted with 20 participants. Results suggest that perceptions toward the RA (trust, credibility, and satisfaction) are influenced by the RA information richness, but not by the effort needed to reach this information. In addition to contributing to HCI literature, the findings have implications for the design of better AI-based RA systems.",,第1页.xls

Tasks such as world exploration, constrained pathfinding or team tactics and coordination just to name a few are now default requirements for contemporary video games. However, despite its recent advances, video game AI still lacks the ability to learn. In this paper, we attempt to break the barrier between video game AI and machine learning and propose a generic method allowing real-time strategy (RTS) agents to learn production strategies from a set of recorded games using supervised learning.

The proposed architecture revolves around the use of interface and user supervisor agents. Primarily, these agents are responsible for the flow of information to and from individual users and user groups. The agents are also responsible for tackling the synchronisation and control issues arising during the completion of cooperative tasks.In this paper a novel approach to human computer interaction (HCI) for power systems incorporating an embedded agent infrastructure is presented.

This article presents the data sets collected for 171 participants assigned to 31 design teams, 15 teams under the guidance of an AI agent (5 participants), and 16 teams under the guidance of a human manager (6 participants). These data sets can be used for data-driven design, behavioral analyses, sequence-based analyses, and natural language processing.",,第1页.xls
972,Towards Enhanced Virtual Chronic Care: Artificial Intelligence-Human Computer Interaction Integration in Synchronous Virtual Consultations,2024,"Rising adoption of virtual consultations for patients with chronic conditions in recent years have highlighted their need to be explored and optimised with novel means. These are being undertaken in this on-going interdisciplinary PhD which combines human computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI) development and innovation with a participatory approach. This study adopts a multi-stage design inferred by the Integrate Design Assess and Share (IDEAS) framework and includes Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) input to enhance the study design. Firstly, a scoping review was conducted based on the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The on-going second stage adopts qualitative methodologies to gain insights into the lived experiences and challenges of patients and healthcare professionals when engaged in virtual consultations. These findings will inform the iterative development of an adequate AI tool in the third stage. Initial findings from the upcoming publication of the full scoping review generally indicate positive virtual consultation experiences and identified key areas of improvement that inform the focus of the qualitative study and the design of interview guides. Potential AI applications include rule-based conversational agents and decision support systems. While on-going, this timely study provides crucial insights into the HCI elements of virtual consultations and explores novel AI means to enhance such interactions.",,第1页.xls
973,Resilient Team Formation with Stabilisability of Agent Networks for Task Allocation,2021,"Team formation (TF) faces the problem of defining teams of agents able to accomplish a set of tasks. Resilience on TF problems aims to provide robustness and adaptability to unforeseen events involving agent deletion. However, agents are unaware of the inherent social welfare in these teams. This article tackles the problem of how teams can minimise their effort in terms of organisation and communication considering these dynamics. Our main contribution is twofold: first, we introduce the Stabilisable Team Formation (STF) as a generalisation of current resilient TF model, where a team is stabilisable if it possesses and preserves its inter-agent organisation from a graph-based perspective. Second, our experiments show that stabilisability is able to reduce the exponential execution time in several units of magnitude with the most restrictive configurations, proving that communication effort in subsequent task allocation problems are relaxed compared with current resilient teams. To do so, we developed SBB-ST, a branch-and-bound algorithm based on Distributed Constrained Optimisation Problems (DCOP) to compute teams. Results evidence that STF improves their predecessors, extends the resilience to subsequent task allocation problems represented as DCOP, and evidence how Stabilisability contributes to resilient TF problems by anticipating decisions for saving resources and minimising the effort on team organisation in dynamic scenarios.",,第1页.xls
974,Agent-based Modeling and Simulation of cyber-warfare between malefactors and security agents in internet,2005,"The paper considers an approach to modeling and simulation of cyber-wars in Internet between the teams of software agents. Each team is a community of agents cloned on various network hosts. The approach is considered by an example of modeling and simulation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and protection against them. Agents of different teams compete to reach antagonistic intentions. Agents of the same team cooperate to realize joint intentions. The ontologies of DDoS-attacks and mechanisms of protection against them are described. The variants of agents' team structures, the mechanisms of their interaction and coordination, the specifications of hierarchy of action plans as well as the developed software prototypes are determined.",,第1页.xls

The focus of this paper is to present our solution to integrate the communication information into our team-driven multi-model motion tracking. We present the probabilistic tracking algorithm in detail and present empirical results both in simulation and in a Segway soccer team. The information from team communication allows the robot to much more effectively track mobile targets.,,第1页.xls
976,Safeguarding AI Agents: Developing and Analyzing Safety Architectures,2024,"AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.",,第1页.xls

979,An agent-based approach to task allocation in a computer support team,1997,"The authors present an agent-based system for allocating tasks to members of a team of computer support engineers. The task allocation problem can be broadly characterised as follows: clients contact the team with task requests. The team must negotiate with the clients to agree who will perform each task, and when they will do it. The agreements must satisfy the needs of each client as much as possible, must use the team effectively, and must allow the team members some degree of influence over the decisions which are made. The motivation behind the work is not to produce a system which will be deployed, but rather to use this problem as a reference application for exploring different approaches to the design of agent systems. In particular, they are interested in exploring a variety of different macro-architectures for organising communication between, and coordination of, agents. They present the problem of task allocation in computer support teams, and give details of the first architecture they developed to solve the problem. They also present the design of the testbed they developed, which will allow the implementation of a variety of different approaches in the future.",,第1页.xls
980,Enabling Value Sensitive AI Systems through Participatory Design Fictions [arXiv],2019,"Two general routes have been followed to develop artificial agents that are sensitive to human values---a top-down approach to encode values into the agents, and a bottom-up approach to learn from human actions, whether from real-world interactions or stories. Although both approaches have made exciting scientific progress, they may face challenges when applied to the current development practices of AI systems, which require the under-standing of the specific domains and specific stakeholders involved. In this work, we bring together perspectives from the human-computer interaction (HCI) community, where designing technologies sensitive to user values has been a longstanding focus. We highlight several well-established areas focusing on developing empirical methods for inquiring user values. Based on these methods, we propose participatory design fictions to study user values involved in AI systems and present preliminary results from a case study. With this paper, we invite the consideration of user-centered value inquiry and value learning.",,第1页.xls

984,Two-Sided Parameter Learning of Role Selections for Efficient Team Formation,2012,"We propose a method of learning to determine appropriate roles for forming efficiently teams by self-interested agents in task-oriented domains. Service requests on computer networks have recently been rapidly increasing. To improve the performance of such systems, issues with efficient team formation to do tasks have attracted our interest. The main feature of the proposed method is learning from two-sided viewpoints, i.e., team leaders who have the initiative to form teams or team members who work in one of the teams that are solicited. For this purpose, we introduce three parameters to agents so that they can select their roles of being a leader or a member. Then, an agent can anticipate what other agents should be selected as team members and what team it should join. Our experiments demonstrated that the amount of utility earned as the result of successful team formation was considerably larger than that with a conventional method. We also conducted a number of experiments to investigate the characteristics of the proposed method. The results revealed that the divisional cooperation between agents was developed, which could reduce the chance of conflicts in decisions to play roles and this achieved efficient team formation.",,第1页.xls

986,Invoking Principles of Groupware to Develop and Evaluate Present and Future Human-Agent Teams,2020,"Advances in artificial intelligence are constantly increasing its validity as a team member enabling it to effectively work alongside humans and other artificial teammates. Unfortunately, the digital nature of artificial teammates and their restrictive communication and coordination requirements complicate the interaction patterns that exist. In light of this challenge, we create a theoretical framework that details the possible interactions in human-agent teams, emphasizing interactions through groupware, which is based on literature regarding groupware and human-agent teamwork. As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence. The results are a framework that detail human-agent interaction throughout the coming years, which can be used to guide groupware development.",,第1页.xls
987,The Influence of Stubborn Agents in a Multi-Agent Network for Inter-Team Cooperation/Negotiation,2015,"When teams interact for cooperation or negotiation, there are unique dynamics that occur depending on the conditions. In this paper, a multi-agent system is used under the restrain of a network structure to model two teams of agents interacting for a common consensus, however with the presence of stubborn agents. The networks used were a minimum dumbbell network and two scale-free networks joined together. The network topology, which is a global characteristic, along with the presence of conflicting stubborn agents, can cause various conditions that affect teamwork in cooperation or negotiation. Notable characteristics revealed are boundary role persons (BRPs), lack of unity, need for a third party moderator, coalition formation, and loyalty of the BRP dependent on the distance from the core ideology of the team. Both local and global characteristics of network structures contribute to such phenomenon. The modeling method and corresponding simulation results provide valuable insight for predicting possible social dynamics and outcome when planning cooperation/negotiation tactics.",,第1页.xls
988,On team knowledge and common knowledge,1998,"In this paper we report on an approach to defining knowledge in multi-agent systems that allows the knowledge of a structured group of agents (a team) to be more than just the knowledge from individual sub-teams. Teams are first class entities in our logic. A team may have a sub-team relationship with other teams. A team which has no sub-ream relationships with other teams is considered to be an agent. We ascribe knowledge directly to teams. Relationships between team and sub-team knowledge are specified axiomatically. We show that the introduction of team knowledge in this setting yields a definition of common knowledge which is an interesting generalization of the well known definition of common knowledge provided by Halpern and Moses. (sic)From a systems development perspective, the separation of knowledge from sub-team knowledge allows for both top-down and bottom-up specifications of team behavior in a single framework.",,第1页.xls
989,Team Agent Behavior Architecture in Robot Soccer,2008,"One of the most challenging goals in artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop a team of autonomous agents with human-performance. In a team-based multi-agent system with cooperative and opponent team agents, the ability to build a coordinated system of game strategies can be useful to provide the agents with team plans to achieve common goals. These team plans are used to make agents decide which behavior is the best in a given situation, specially in a realistic setting of situated agents with local perception and uncertain domains. In this paper we present a Team Agent Behavior Architecture (TABA), an approach to coordinate the behavior of a multiagent team. We introduce an autonomous and dynamic leader agent capable of analyzing the current environment, including the opponent team, and select a team plan according to the state of the world; this agent is selected among one of our cooperative team agents. The roles of the robots are not fixed and they can dynamically exchange their roles with each other. The plan selected is pre-defined and is communicated to the rest of the agents who execute it in a distributed fashion. We also propose a Soccer Strategy Description Symbols (SSDS) that is very simple and intuitive. TABA is built using a hierarchical architecture. The first stage is responsible for leader agent selection; the second stage is for strategy selection; the third stage is for role assignment and last stage is for tactic execution, in which robots execute their behavior commands based on their roles. We have successfully followed a Case-Based Reasoning approach for strategy selection in the robot soccer domain, a simulation of the RoboCup four-legged league soccer competition. Initial results of TABA are also discussed.",,第1页.xls

Our algorithm attempts to minimize the number of agents required to guarantee that any incursion into the region of interest is detected. The algorithm works by analyzing the geometric structure of the environment, and placing agents at advantageous positions in the environment, such as bottlenecks, to create a defensive perimeter of agents alongside physical obstacles (e.g. buildings). We demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithm through experimental simulations in an urban environment, and show how the min-cuts subroutine (used to reduce the number of agents required) can be implemented in a distributed way across the multi-agent team to enable better solutions to be found more quickly.",,第1页.xls

This paper proposed a multi-agent based simulation methods to model scrum team and the proposed innovative team working strategy, in order to verify the performance of the team under different working strategies. A solo strategy and pair programming strategies for the scrum team are designed.

The testing experiment shows that the adoption of pair programming to scrum team can help the team to improve its performance under specific context.",,第1页.xls
993,When are artificial intelligence versus human agents faulted for wrongdoing? Moral attributions after individual and joint decisions,2019,"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents make decisions that affect individuals and society which can produce outcomes traditionally considered moral violations if performed by humans. Do people attribute the same moral permissibility and fault to AIs and humans when each produces the same moral violation outcome? Additionally, how do people attribute morality when the AI and human are jointly making the decision which produces that violation? We investigate these questions with an experiment that manipulates written descriptions of four real-world scenarios where, originally, a violation outcome was produced by an AI. Our decision-making structures include individual decision-making - either AIs or humans - and joint decision-making - either humans monitoring AIs or AIs recommending to humans. We find that the decision-making structure has little effect on morally faulting AIs, but that humans who monitor AIs are faulted less than solo humans and humans receiving recommendations. Furthermore, people attribute more permission and less fault to AIs compared to humans for the violation in both joint decision-making structures. The blame for joint AI-human wrongdoing suggests the potential for strategic scapegoating of AIs for human moral failings and the need for future research on AI-human teams.",,第1页.xls

995,An Analysis of Video Games Using the Dimensions of Human-Agent Interaction,2018,"Designers of human-agent interaction techniques may benefit from an analysis of existing video games that include aspects of human-agent teaming. Many popular multi-player video games have been designed to integrate multiple human and computer agents in pursuit of a common objective and can serve as a testbed to explore novel interaction methods in human-agent teams. A guiding framework of human-agent interaction was created to bridge best practices between video game and real-world domains. The framework was used to analyze games on five main dimensions: 1) Levels of Automation, 2) Levels of Interaction, 3) Control Mode, 4) Teaming, and 5) Interaction Timing. Two video games, Final Fantasy XIV and Mass Effect, were assessed to identify human-agent interaction paradigms, and ramifications for real-world applications for human-agent teaming. This research draws on interaction design principles, human-agent interaction theory, and existing video games to offer human-agent team designers potential examples of successful interaction paradigms.",,第1页.xls
996,Team formation strategies in a dynamic large-scale environment,2006,"In open markets and within business and government organizations, fully autonomous agents may form teams to work on large, multifaceted problems. Factors such as uncertain information, bounded rationality and environmental dynamicism can lead to sudden, unforeseen changes in both solution requirements and team participation. Accordingly, this paper proposes and examines strategies for team formation strategies in a large-scale, dynamic environment. Strategies control how agents select problems to work on and partners to work with. The paper includes an experimental evaluation of the relative utility of each strategy in an increasingly dynamic environment, and concludes that a strategy which combines greedy job selection with adaptive team selection performs best in highly dynamic environments. Alternatively, greedy job selection combined with selecting smaller teams performs best in environments with little to no dynamicism.",,第1页.xls

To demonstrate that team training software can be made more flexible, this paper presents an approach to incorporating software agents into the distributed command-and-control (C2) simulation software DDD, which supports only human players. Based on the multiagent architecture CAST, the software agents are designed as a team to perform C2 tasks in the DDD. By associating the agents with the same basic capabilities as the DDD provides its human users, we illustrate how to specify the teamwork knowledge for the agent team, and how to make agents efficiently reason about the dynamic, partially observable environment. Different methods of communication and coordination among agents are also briefly described.",,第1页.xls

Concepts like multi agent systems demonstrate that this research situation begins to change as AI-researchers more frequently consider the importance of context for cognitive development.

In this work we investigated how a set of vocal characteristics known as conversational style could play role in engaging users in an interaction with a virtual agent. We also examined whether the similarity attraction principle influences how people orient towards agents with different styles. Results of a within subject experiment on 102 subjects revealed that users exhibited similarity attraction toward computer agents, and preferred the agent whose conversational style matched their own. The study results contribute to our understanding of how the design of intelligent agents' conversational style influences users' engagement and perceptions of the agent, compared to known human-to-human interaction.",,第2页.xls

In this paper we present a novel approach for a reward allocation in which reward payments are conducted between agents. We consider foraging task in small maze as a test problem. Firstly, we investigate an algorithm in which exchanges of (fixed amount of) reward for a food are made between agents. The experimental results show that our approach can produce territorial division of labor and its performance is significantly improved than a global reinforcement approach in which all the agents obtain equally divided reward. Secondly, several extended algorithms in which agents can determine the price of a food on their own are investigated, it is shown that minimal negotiations between agents are effective for suitable price determination and good performances of teams.",,第2页.xls

4,Probabilistic Modeling of Human Teams to Infer False Beliefs [arXiv],2023,"We develop a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) for artificially intelligent (AI) agents to infer human beliefs during a simulated urban search and rescue (USAR) scenario executed in a Minecraft environment with a team of three players. The PGM approach makes observable states and actions explicit, as well as beliefs and intentions grounded by evidence about what players see and do over time. This approach also supports inferring the effect of interventions, which are vital if AI agents are to assist human teams. The experiment incorporates manipulations of players' knowledge, and the virtual Minecraft-based testbed provides access to several streams of information, including the objects in the players' field of view. The participants are equipped with a set of marker blocks that can be placed near room entrances to signal the presence or absence of victims in the rooms to their teammates. In each team, one of the members is given a different legend for the markers than the other two, which may mislead them about the state of the rooms; that is, they will hold a false belief. We extend previous works in this field by introducing ToMCAT, an AI agent that can reason about individual and shared mental states. We find that the players' behaviors are affected by what they see in their in-game field of view, their beliefs about the meaning of the markers, and their beliefs about which meaning the team decided to adopt. In addition, we show that ToMCAT's beliefs are consistent with the players' actions and that it can infer false beliefs with accuracy significantly better than chance and comparable to inferences made by human observers.",,第2页.xls

6,The potential for intelligent software agents in defence simulation,1999,"The ability of intelligent agents to perform simple tasks autonomously has aroused much interest in potential military simulation applications, such as to support procurement, force development, evaluation of C3 structures, and training. Team work requires both coordination and shared goals. The emerging view is that intentionality, and team behaviour, needs to built into the team architecture from the ground up. Current research in teams is directed towards BDI (belief, desire, intention) agents in command and control. This paper describes the application of intelligent software agents to military simulation. The deployment of applications in parallel with further development and formalisation of the BDI agent architecture has given rise to a landmark R&D capability in multi-agent systems based in Australia.",,第2页.xls
7,The Role of a Reward in Shaping Multiple Football Agents' Behavior: An Empirical Study,2023,"In reinforcement learning (RL), a reward formed with a scalar value is seen as a sufficient means to guide an agent's behavior. A reward drives an agent to seek out an optimal policy to solve a problem (or to achieve a goal) under uncertainty. In this paper, we aimed to probe the benefit of such a scalar reward in the shaping of coordination policy using artificial football scenarios. In a football setting, a team normally practices two types of strategies: one is a primary formation, that is, the default strategy of a team regardless of their opponents (e.g., 4-4-2, 4-3-3), and the other is an adaptive strategy, that is, a reactive tactic responding to the spontaneous changes of their opponents. We focused here on the primary formation as a team coordination policy that can be trained by a reward using multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithms. Once a team of multiple football agents has successfully learned a primary formation based on a reward-driven approach, we assumed that the team is able to exhibit the primary formation when facing various opponent teams they have never faced in due course to receive a reward. To precisely examine this behavior, we conducted a large number of simulations with twelve artificial football teams in an AI world cup environment. Here, we trained two MARL-based football teams with a team guided by a random walk formation. Afterwards, we performed the artificial football matches with the most competitive of the twelve teams that the MARL-based teams had never played against. Given the analyses of the performance of each football team with regard to their average score and competitiveness, the results showed that the proposed MARL teams outperformed the others with respect to competitiveness, although these teams were not the best with respect to the average score. This indicated that the coordination policy of the MARL-based football teams was moderately consistent against both known and unknown opponents due to the successful learning of a primary formation following the guidance of a scalar reward.",,第2页.xls

Effective agent interactions in such domains raise some of the most fundamental research challenges for agent-based systems, in teamwork, multi-agent learning and agent modelling. The RoboCup research initiative, particularly the simulation league, has been proposed to pursue such multi-agent research challenges, using the common testbed of simulation soccer. Despite the significant popularity of RoboCup within the research community, general lessons have not often been extracted from participation in RoboCup. This is what we attempt to do. We have fielded two teams, ISIS97 and ISIS98, in RoboCup competitions. These teams have been in the top four teams in these competitions.

With the continued rise of virtual teams, collaborative work increasingly requires tools to manage the reality of distributed and remote work, which is often hampered by a lack of social cohesion and such phenomena as participant multi-tasking.

11,A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF TEAM ASSEMBLY IN EMERGING SCIENTIFIC FIELDS,2015,"This paper examines the assembly of interdisciplinary teams in emerging scientific fields. We develop and validate a hybrid systems dynamics and agent-based computational model using data over a 15 year period from the assembly of teams in the emerging scientific field of Oncofertility. We found that, when a new field emerges, team assembly is influenced by the reputation and seniority of the researchers, prior collaborators, prior collaborators' collaborators, and the prior popularity of an individual as a collaborator by all others. We also found that individuals are more likely to assemble into an Oncofertility team when there is a modicum of overlap across its global ecosystem of teams; the ecosystem is defined as the collection of teams that share members with other teams that share members with the Oncofertility team.",,第2页.xls
12,Know thine enemy: a champion RoboCup coach agent,2007,"In a team-based multiagent system, the ability to construct a model of an opponent team's joint behavior can be useful for determining an agent's expected distribution over future world states, and thus can inform its planning of future actions. This paper presents an approach to team opponent modeling in the context of the RoboCup simulation coach competition. Specifically, it introduces an autonomous coach agent capable of analyzing past games of the current opponent, advising its own team how to play against this opponent, and identifying patterns or weaknesses on the part of the opponent. Our approach is fully implemented and tested within the RoboCup soccer server, and was the champion of the RoboCup 2005 simulation coach competition.",,第2页.xls

14,Human Computer Interactions in Next-Generation of Aircraft Smart Navigation Management Systems: Task Analysis and Architecture under an Agent-Oriented Methodological Approach,2015,"The limited efficiency of current air traffic systems will require a next-generation of Smart Air Traffic System (SATS) that relies on current technological advances. This challenge means a transition toward a new navigation and air-traffic procedures paradigm, where pilots and air traffic controllers perform and coordinate their activities according to new roles and technological supports. The design of new Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) for performing these activities is a key element of SATS. However efforts for developing such tools need to be inspired on a parallel characterization of hypothetical air traffic scenarios compatible with current ones. This paper is focused on airborne HCI into SATS where cockpit inputs came from aircraft navigation systems, surrounding traffic situation, controllers' indications, etc. So the HCI is intended to enhance situation awareness and decision-making through pilot cockpit. This work approach considers SATS as a system distributed on a large-scale with uncertainty in a dynamic environment. Therefore, a multi-agent systems based approach is well suited for modeling such an environment. We demonstrate that current methodologies for designing multi-agent systems are a useful tool to characterize HCI. We specifically illustrate how the selected methodological approach provides enough guidelines to obtain a cockpit HCI design that complies with future SATS specifications.",,第2页.xls

16,A-teams: An agent architecture for optimization and decision-support,1999,"The effectiveness of an agent architecture is measured by its successful application to real problems. In this paper, we describe an agent architecture, A-Teams, that we have successfully used to develop real-world optimization and decision support applications. In an A-Team, an asynchronous team of agents shares a population of solutions and evolves an optimized set of solutions. Each agent embodies its own algorithm for creating, improving or eliminating a solution. Through sharing of the population of solutions, cooperative behavior between agents emerges and tends to result in better solutions than any one agent could produce. Since agents in an A-Team are autonomous and asynchronous, the architecture is both scalable and robust. In order to make the architecture easier to use and more widely available, we have developed an A-Team class library that provides a foundation for creating A-Team based decision-support systems.",,第2页.xls
17,Experimental Assessment of an Emotion Tracking Software Agent (ETA) for assisting Communicative Interactions of Multitasking Users in Groupware,2010,Interactions such as discussion and negotiation in face-to-face work contexts strongly rely on non-verbal feedback. Such feedback provides indications of important negotiation states such as agreement or disagreement and understanding or confusion. The increasing popularity of groupware and its use by virtual teams for collaborative remote work necessitates the development of appropriate tools to manage the reality of distributed and remote work. Such remote collaboration is often hampered by a lack of social cohesion and such phenomena as participant multi-tasking. This paper outlines the experimental assessment of a proof of concept AI based software agent (Emotion Tracking Agent or ETA) for the real-time tracking of groupware user's facial expressions of emotion during virtual meetings. The software agent is designed as a novel approach to the removal of negative or unwanted effects of user multitasking and attention distracting behaviours in virtual collaboration and meeting environments.,,第2页.xls

19,The Effect of Virtual Agents Emotion Displays and Appraisals on Peoples Decision Making in Negotiation,2012,"There is growing evidence that emotion displays can impact peoples decision making in negotiation. However, despite increasing interest in AI and HCI on negotiation as a means to resolve differences between humans and agents, emotion has been largely ignored. We explore how emotion displays in virtual agents impact peoples decision making in human-agent negotiation. This paper presents an experiment (N=204) that studies the effects of virtual agents displays of joy, sadness, anger and guilt on peoples decision to counteroffer, accept or drop out from the negotiation, as well as on peoples expectations about the agents decisions. The paper also presents evidence for a mechanism underlying such effects based on appraisal theories of emotion whereby people retrieve, from emotion displays, information about how the agent is appraising the ongoing interaction and, from this information, infer about the agents intentions and reach decisions themselves. We discuss implications for the design of intelligent virtual agents that can negotiate effectively.",,第2页.xls

This paper describes how to harvest these results and proposes a team for situations where human-agent collaboration is crucial to its success. A specific game type within Unreal Tournament is utilised, called Capture The Flag[5]. The proposed team is designed with the Prometheus agent design methodology[6] as a guide and is comprised of humans and agents each having a specific role.",,第2页.xls

22,Optimal rewards in multiagent teams,2012,"Following work on designing optimal rewards for single agents, we define a multiagent optimal rewards problem (ORP) in common-payoff (or team) settings. This new problem solves for individual agent reward functions that guide agents to better overall team performance relative to teams in which all agents guide their behavior with the same given team-reward function. We present a multiagent architecture in which each agent learns good reward functions from experience using a gradient-based algorithm in addition to performing the usual task of planning good policies (except in this case with respect to the learned rather than the given reward function). Multiagency introduces the challenge of nonstationarity: because the agents learn simultaneously, each agent's learning problem is nonstationary and interdependent on the other agents. We demonstrate on two simple domains that the proposed architecture outperforms the conventional approach in which all the agents use the same given team-reward function (even when accounting for the resource overhead of the reward learning); that the learning algorithm performs stably despite the nonstationarity; and that learning individual reward functions can lead to better specialization of roles than is possible with shared reward, whether learned or given.",,第2页.xls
23,IMPACT: A Trust Model for Human-Agent Teaming,2020,"A trust model IMPACT: Intention, Measurability, Predictability, Agility, Communication, and Transparency has been conceptualized to build human trust in autonomous agents. The six critical characteristics must be exhibited by the agents in order to gain and maintain the trust from their human partners towards an effective and collaborative team in achieving common goals. The IMPACT model guided a design of an intelligent adaptive decision aid for dynamic target engagement processes in a military context. Positive feedback from subject matter experts participated in a large scale joint exercise controlling multiple unmanned vehicles indicated the effectiveness of the decision aid. It also demonstrated the utility of the IMPACT model as design principles for building up a trusted human-agent teaming.",,第2页.xls
24,Experimental Investigation of the Synergetic Effect Produced by Agents Solving Together Instances of the Euclidean Planar Travelling Salesman Problem,2010,"The goal of the paper is to identify and confirm the existence of the synergetic effect produced by agents solving together instances of the Euclidean planar travelling salesman problem. The research included the computational experiment in which computation results produced by six implemented A-Teams are analyzed. The reported A-Teams have been built using the JABAT environment. Combinations of five local search procedures, each encoded as an optimizing agent, have been used. The experiment involved instances of the Euclidean planar travelling salesman problem of different sizes. Problem instances have been solved by different A-Teams with different numbers of individuals in the population of solutions stored in the common memory. The research has confirmed that constructing an A-Team from heterogeneous optimizing agents might result in achieving a synergetic effect and thus increasing a quality of the computation results.",,第2页.xls
25,A Markovian Decision Process Analysis of Experienced Agents Joining Ad-Hoc Teams,2018,"As the number of agents grows in a multi-agent system, it is very impractical to have a team that is preprogrammed to share a cooperation protocol. In this situation experienced agents that have been trained to cooperate with different teams come in handy. In this paper based on some UAV teams, we investigate the behavior of an experienced agent which we call ad-hoc agent. First, we train the ad-hoc agent to cooperate with different teams and in different environmental situations. This training is based on an approximated version of MDP which is very fast. Then the ad-hoc agent joins the teams and tries to cooperate with them in a Persistent Surveillance Mission(PSM). Our experiment for the ad-hoc agent starts with joining different fixed strategy teams and ends with joining a fully cooperative team. The results of the simulation show that the performance of a team having an ad-hoc agent is even comparable to a team that has completely trained together.",,第2页.xls

In this frame, we first describe the architecture of this system and propose assistance interaction protocols to specify agent external behaviours in performing their tasks. Then, we discuss the semantic representation of agent communication and describe an abstraction layer to let agents understand user message issues. Our future work aims at improving these mechanisms and enriching them toward a full-fledged implementation.",,第2页.xls

We also present an example to illustrate how to express team actions with the new constructs.,,第2页.xls
28,"The Impact of Multimodal Communication on a Shared Mental Model, Trust, and Commitment in Human-Intelligent Virtual Agent Teams",2018,"There is an increasing interest in the use of intelligent virtual agents (IVAs) to work in teams with humans. To achieve successful outcomes for these heterogeneous teams, many of the aspects found in successful human teams will need to be supported. These aspects include behavioural (i.e., multimodal communication), cognitive (i.e., a shared mental model (SMM)), and social (trust and commitment). Novelly, this paper aims to investigate the impact of IVAs multimodal communication on the development of a SMM between humans and IVAs. Moreover, this paper aims to explore the impact of the developed SMM on a humans trust in an IVAs decisions and a humans commitment to honour his/her promises to an IVA. The results from two studies involving a collaborative activity showed a significant positive correlation between team multimodal communication (i.e., behavioural aspect) and a SMM between teammates (i.e., cognitive aspect). Moreover, the result showed that there is a significant positive correlation between the developed SMM and a humans trust in the IVAs decision and the humans commitment to honour his/her promises (the establishment of the social aspect of teamwork). Additionally, the results showed a cumulative effect of all of these aspects on human-agent team performance. These results can guide the design of human-agent teamwork multimodal communication models.",,第2页.xls

In order to solve complex problem multiple agents are divided into several teams, each team is made of some agents and takes charge of one sub-problem. Each agent in a team embodies its own algorithm for creating a solution, and one agent may modify the solutions of the other agents by means of negotiating. Humans may also participate as agents in the process of decision-making.",,第2页.xls
30,Strategy learning for a team in adversary environments,2002,"Team strategy acquisition is one of the most important issues of multi-agent systems, especially in an adversary environment. RoboCup has been providing such an environment for AI and robotics researchers. A deliberative approach to the team strategy acquisition seems useless in such a dynamic and hostile environment. This paper presents a learning method to acquire team strategy from a viewpoint of coach who can change a combination of players each of which has a fixed policy. Assuming that the opponent has the same choice for the team strategy but keeps the fixed strategy during one match, the coach estimates the opponent team strategy (player's combination) based on game progress (obtained and lost goals) and notification of the opponent strategy just after each match. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is handled by considering how correct the expectation in each mode is. A case of 2 to 2 match was simulated and the final result (a class of the strongest combinations) was applied to RoboCup-2000 competition.",,第2页.xls
31,Being the new guy in an experienced team enhancing training on the job,2002,"We present a modification to evolutionary on-line learning of cooperative behavior, based on a special action learn, that allows the performance of a new agent replacing an old agent with somewhat different abilities in an experienced team to be improved. The general idea is to make us of the strategy of the old agent, obtained either directly or by the model the other team members made of it. This would be used as a seed strategy in the on-line learning process providing a focus to the process. This way, the flexibility of on-line learning remains, and the new agent is much less prone to making beginner mistakes that may prevent achievement of the team goal. Experiments with rather different variants of the pursuit game show that our method allows new agents to overcome the difference in abilities rather quickly. Thus, team performance is much better than when the new agent starts learning from scratch.",,第2页.xls

33,Modelling and simulation of tactical team behaviour,2007,"Realistic military simulations are needed for analysis, planning, and training. Intelligent agent technology is a valuable software concept with the potential of being widely used in military simulation applications. They provide a powerful abstraction mechanism required for designing simulations of complex and dynamic battlefields. Their ability to model the tactical decision-making behaviour of simulated battlefield entities gives them an edge over other techniques. During battlefield simulation, these entities generally represent individualistic behaviour, taking operational order from higher control and executing relevant plans. However, since a complex battlefield scenario typically involves thousands of entities, their coordinated team behaviour should also be considered to make the simulation more realistic. This paper demonstrates the use of intelligent agent-based team behaviour modelling concepts in simulating the armoured tanks in a tactical masking scenario.",,第2页.xls
34,Towards flexible negotiation in teamwork,1999,"In a complex, dynamic multi-agent setting, coherent team actions are often jeopardized by agents' conflicting beliefs about different aspects of their environment, about resource availability, and about their own or teammates' capabilities and performance. Team members thus need to communicate and negotiate to restore team coherence. This paper focuses on the problem of negotiations in teamwork to resolve such conflicts. The basis of such negotiations is inter-agent argumentation based on Toulmin's (1958) argumentation pattern. There are several novel aspects in our approach. First, our approach to argumentation exploits recently developed general, explicit teamwork models, which make it possible to provide a generalized and reusable argumentation facility based on teamwork constraints. Second, an emphasis on collaboration in argumentation leads to novel argumentation strategies geared towards benefiting the team rather than the individual. Third, our goal, to realize argumentation in practice in an agent team, has led to decision theoretic and pruning techniques to reduce argumentation overhead. Our approach is implemented in a system called CONSA.",,第2页.xls
35,A role-based decision-mechanism for teams of reactive and coordinating agents,1998,"In this paper we present a system for developing autonomous agents that combine reactivity to an uncertain and rapidly changing environment with commitment to prespecified tactics involving coordination and team work, The concept of roles in a team is central to the paper. Agents act and coordinate with other agents depending on their roles. The decision-mechanism of an agent is specified in terms of prioritized rules organized in a decision tree. In the decision-tree both reactivity to changes in the environment and commitment to long term courses of actions (behaviors) are present, The coordination between agents is mainly obtained through common tactics, strategies, and observations of actions of team members, rather than explicit communication. Coordinated behaviors can be specified in terms of roles and are encoded simultaneously for all participating agents.",,第2页.xls
36,Reducing Q-Value Estimation Bias via Mutual Estimation and Softmax Operation in MADRL,2023,"With the development of electronic game technology, the content of electronic games presents a larger number of units, richer unit attributes, more complex game mechanisms, and more diverse team strategies. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning shines brightly in this type of team electronic game, achieving results that surpass professional human players. Reinforcement learning algorithms based on Q-value estimation often suffer from Q-value overestimation, which may seriously affect the performance of AI in multi-agent scenarios. We propose a multi-agent mutual evaluation method and a multi-agent softmax method to reduce the estimation bias of Q values in multi-agent scenarios, and have tested them in both the particle multi-agent environment and the multi-agent tank environment we constructed. The multi-agent tank environment we have built has achieved a good balance between experimental verification efficiency and multi-agent game task simulation. It can be easily extended for different multi-agent cooperation or competition tasks. We hope that it can be promoted in the research of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.",,第2页.xls
37,Simulation of the Teaching Team Based on Multi-agent,2012,"In order to study the dynamic process of cooperation-competition in the teaching team and the construction of a cooperation mechanism to improve the overall performance, this paper proposes the hypothesis that both egoism and non-egoism exist in humanity and that resources are both limited and unlimited. It brings the mechanism of direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity and kin altruism into the study of cooperation-competition in the teaching team, builds the Member-agent. and Team-agent simulation model, and analyzes the payoff and strategy equilibrium in single round interaction of teacher-to-teacher and teacher-to-student respectively. Moreover, it simulates the infinite round dynamic interactions between multi-agent and reachs the conclusions that whether team members cooperate or not has nothing to do with what they cooperate on, and that in order to improve the overall performance of the team it is necessary to maintain a harmonious relationship between members, to form a positive atmosphere, to keep critical resources sufficient, and to promote equity. Finally, it introduced the practical application in Xuchang University.",,第2页.xls
38,From centralized to distributed selective overhearing,2007,"Overhearing is an approach for monitoring open, distributed, multi-agent systems by listening to the routine communications taking place within them. Previous investigations of overhearing assumed that all inter-agent communications are accessible to a single overhearing agent. However, as multi-agent systems grow both in size and distribution two problems arise. First, in large-scale settings, an overhearing agent cannot monitor all agents and their conversations, and must therefore be selective in carefully choosing its targets. Second, a single overhearer would encounter difficulties overhearing agents acting in a geographically-distributed environment. This paper tackles these challenges by addressing distributed teams of overhearing agents involved in selective overhearing. Building on prior work on centralized selective overhearing, we consider the consequences of transitioning from overhearing teams working in a centrally-coordinated manner to distributed overhearing teams. In doing so, we distinguish the various factors influencing the level of distribution within these teams and determine their importance in terms of effective selective overhearing.",,第2页.xls
39,Impacts of team size on role learning in multiagent systems,2008,"In multiagent systems, division of labor is essential for achieving tasks. To reduce the burden of the designer, it is preferable that agents assume their role by learning. Thus, it is important to clarify the appropriate conditions under which division of labor can easily emerge. In this paper, we focus on the impact of team size on role learning. We use a simple transportation task as the test problem and investigate the impact of the team size on the learnability of division of labor.The results show that a large team size is beneficial for learning of division of labor.",,第2页.xls

The learners have the ability to learn together thus utilising one another's strengths and alleviating individual weaknesses. This paper describes the cooperative inductive learning team (CILT) multi-agent learning system that consists of two or more machine learners which induce rules from training examples.

41,Modeling the Effects of Personality on Team Formation in Self-assembly Teams,2015,"Optimizing the performance of teams in modern organizations is an important managerial function, and particularly so in contexts where new teams must continually be formed voluntarily, such as with software development, crowd-sourcing platforms, and even the formation of scientific collaborative teams. In many such cases, team performance is significantly influenced by the makeup of participant personalities and temperaments and goes beyond the analysis of individual skills. In this study, we present a team-assemblage model that is primarily influenced by knowledge of the past performance of team members and their personalities. Our goal is to provide a model, which can be parameterized for specific organizational contexts, for policy makers and managers to assess potential teams formed in dynamic circumstances. To provide real-world validation for our approach, we extracted data from the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, which involves the repeated self-assembly of software teams from a common pool of developers. We then used agent-based simulation to enact our model with PEP data to predict team grouping formation and resulting team performances.",,第2页.xls
42,Agents out of control? Towards the formal verification of autonomous agent teams,2005,"NASA are interested in using intelligent agents in future space missions, for example Mars exploration or deep space missions. Such missions might involve completely autonomous agents, able to direct their own activity, or might involve human-agent (typically human-robot) teams in which the participants work together. However, the dangers of allowing agents to control, even partially, critical aspects of a mission are clear. Software agents, just like any other computer program, need to be verified to ensure they are appropriate for use in mission critical areas. In this talk, we outline some of our ongoing work concerned with verifying, using logical representations of autonomous agents, the behaviour of systems comprising multiple agents. In addition, we indicate the possibilities (and pitfalls) involved in extending this work to more sophisticated human-agent teams.",,第2页.xls
43,Task decomposition and dynamic role assignment for real-time strategic teamwork,1999,"Multi-agent domains consisting of teams of agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment offer challenging research opportunities. In this paper, we introduce periodic team synchronization domains, as time-critical environments in which agents act autonomously with limited communication, but they can periodically synchronize in a full-communication setting. We present a team agent structure that allows for an agent to capture and reason about team agreements. We achieve collaboration between agents through the introduction of formations. A formation decomposes the task space defining a set of roles. Homogeneous agents can flexibly switch roles within formations, and agents can change formations dynamically, according to pre-defined triggers to be evaluated at run-time. This flexibility increases the performance of the overall team. Our team structure further includes pre-planning for frequent situations. We fully implemented this approach in the domain of robotic soccer. Our simulator team made it to the semi-finals of the RoboCup-97 competition, in which 29 teams participated. It achieved a total score of 67-9 over six different games, and successfully demonstrated its flexible team structure. Using the same team structure, our small robot team won the RoboCup-97 small-robot competition, in which 4 teams participated. It achieved a total score of 13-1 over 4 games and also demonstrated its flexible team structure.",,第2页.xls

45,Simulation Platform for Large-scale Multi-agent Team Coordination,2012,"Large-scale multi-agent system has been a popular research field in distributed artificial intelligence. A major challenge exists in team overall performance optimization because there are a large number of uncertainties in agents' complex processes of interactions. In our previous work, we have found that a small change of a parameter may influence the performance significantly. On the other hand, existing researches of large-scale multi-agent coordination algorithm only proved the evidences by simply comparing with the non-intelligent coordination method, where a general simulation platform is required that can abstract the details of environment but is able to simulate the complex coordination activities for each agent. In this paper, we have designed such a general platform for large-scale multi-agent team coordination. This platform is able to simulate a variety of tasks that are imperative to agents' team coordination. In addition, by varying the setting of giving team coordination parameters as well as loading different coordination strategies, it is capable of simulating and evaluating system performance according to different properties and provides the clue on building optimization algorithms in future.",,第2页.xls

48,ENIGMA: An explainable digital twin security solution for cyber-physical systems,2023,"Digital Twins (DTs), being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, share valuable knowledge of the underlying physical processes and act as data acquisition and dissemination sources to Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Moreover, without obstructing the ongoing operations, DTs also provide an assessment platform for evaluating the operational behavior and security of the CPS. Therefore, they become a potential source of data breaches and a broad attack surface for attackers to launch covert attacks. To detect and mitigate security loopholes in DTs, one of the potential solutions is to leverage a gamification approach that can assess the security level of DTs while providing security analysts with a controlled and supportive virtual training environment. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based approaches can complement the idea of security orchestration and automation in the gamification approach. However, AI/ML-based DTs security solutions are generally constrained by the lack of transparency of AI operations, which results in less confidence in the decisions made by the AI models. To address the explainable security challenges of DTs, this article proposes a gamification approach called sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA). While leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming scenarios to assess DTs' security and train security analysts. The game players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI agents (the defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based DT security assessment model that explains the decisions made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack vectors for the defender team, i.e., the AI agent. The SHAP values illustrate the contribution of different features towards predicting the outcome of attack vectors. This explanation can help security analysts to take security measures based on reasoned and trustworthy decisions. Finally, experimental validation has been carried out to demonstrate the viability of ENIGMA.",,第2页.xls
49,The Perception of Teamwork With an Autonomous Agent Enhances Affect and Performance Outcomes,2017,"Among groups of humans, the team structure has been argued to be the most effective way for people to organize to accomplish work. Research suggests that humans and autonomous agents can be more effective when working together. However, the drive toward capable autonomous teammates has focused on design characteristics while ignoring the importance of social interactions between teammates. In the present study we created team structure though task interdependence and observed teamwork outcomes in the form of affect, behavior, and performance outcomes. A team structure resulted in improved affect and performance outcomes relative to a non-team structure. However, team structure did not elicit significant behavioral differences. Human partners received higher affect ratings and elicited significantly more communication from the participant than an autonomous partner. These findings suggest that social interactions between humans and autonomous teammates should be an important design consideration. While the current data is promising, team structure alone may not be sufficient to ensure effective teams, so further research should explore the utility of team development interventions between humans and autonomous agents.",,第2页.xls

This paper first introduces machine learning approaches to problems in conversational AI in general, where computational agents must coordinate with humans to solve tasks using conversational Natural Language. It also covers some of the practical systems developed in the Interaction Lab, ranging from speech interfaces on smart speakers to embodied robots interacting using visually grounded language.

51,Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information Modulation,2024,"This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.

53,Learning to cooperate in solving the traveling salesman problem,2005,"A cooperative team of agents may perform many tasks better than single agents. The question is how cooperation among self-interested agents should be achieved. It is important that, while we encourage cooperation among agents in a team, we maintain autonomy of individual agents as much as possible, so as to maintain flexibility and generality. This paper presents an approach based on bidding utilizing reinforcement values acquired through reinforcement learning. We tested and analyzed this approach and demonstrated that a team indeed performed better than the best single agent as well as the average of single agents.",,第2页.xls

57,A role-based framework for multi-agent teaming,2008,"Multi-agent teaming is a key research field of multi-agent systems. BDI (Belief, Desire, and Intension) architecture has been widely used to solve complex problems. The theory of joint behavior has been widely used to solve the team level optimisation problems. Due to the inherent complexity of real-time and dynamic environments, it is often extremely complex and difficult to formally specify the joint behavior of the team a priori. This paper presents a role-based BDI framework to facilitate cooperation and coordination problems. This BDI framework is extended and based on the commercial agent software development environment known as JACK Teams. A real-time 2D simulation environment known as soccerbots has been used to investigate the difficulties of multi-agent teaming. The layered architecture has been used to group the agents' competitive and cooperative behaviors, which can be learned through experience by using the reinforcement learning techniques.",,第2页.xls
58,Agent-based Intelligent Middleware for User-Centric Services in Ubiquitous Computing Environments,2011,"With the emergence of the ubiquitous computing era, it has become increasingly important for a middleware that fully exploits Human Computer Interaction (HCI)-friendly characteristics in order to support user-centric services. Many studies about HCI-friendly middleware designed to support user-centric services have been performed. However, most of the existing research focuses on functional improvements to middleware that concentrates on a specific application rather than on general user-centric services. In this paper, we propose an agent-based intelligent middleware that provides user-centric services in ubiquitous computing environments. We introduce various HCI-friendly middleware projects that support user-centric services, and propose a design for a middleware architecture that effectively supports several functions, such as context awareness, context management, pattern inference based on user behavior, and dynamic agent generation. We also suggest service scenarios that illustrate the adaptive User Interface (UI), spontaneous UI migration for collaboration between users, and UI migration according to the changes of the user's task environments in smart spaces. We implemented a prototype of our middleware architecture, called Agent-based Intelligent Middleware (AIM), based on our scenarios, in order to show the benefits by verifying the feasibility of user-centric services with minimal user intervention in ubiquitous computing environments.",,第2页.xls
59,Learning collaborative behavior by observation,2010,This paper presents a multi-agent framework capable of learning teamwork by observation. The system combines proven single entity learning by observation techniques with a multi-agent system shown to exhibit effective teamwork. An effective simulated production team is observed. An off-line training algorithm uses the observed data to develop behavior maps for a Collaborative Context-based Reasoning framework. The Collaborative Context-based Reasoning framework provides generic base classes capable of recreating the behavior of the original agents using the behavior maps developed by the training algorithm. The resulting prototype effectively replaces the original team of agents and is capable of reproducing its behavior and generalizing the behavior to encompass similar situations.,,第2页.xls
60,Scalable decentralised decision making and optimisation in heterogeneous teams,2006,"This paper considers the scenario where multiple autonomous agents must cooperate in making decisions to minimise a common team cost function. A distributed optimisation algorithm is presented. This allows each agent to incrementally refine their decisions while intermittently receiving updates from the team. A convergence analysis provides quantitative requirements on the frequency agents must communicate that is prescribed by the problem structure. The general problem requires every agent to have a model of every other agent in the system. To overcome this, a specific subset of systems, called partially separable, is defined. These systems only require each agent to have a combined summary of the rest of the system. This leads to the definition of an infinitely scalable system, which may contain an infinite number of agents while ensuring the local decisions will converge to the optimal team decision. Examples are given for reconnaissance or information gathering tasks.",,第2页.xls

The objective in this paper is to propose a concept of a Web-based and agent-based support system for project teaming carried out in a huge telework community, and develop a prototypical system based on the concept. We defined a model of project teaming in telework community, and pointed out current problems in Web-based job matchmaking. Next, we proposed a concept of agent-based support system for project teaming which consists of an agent-based job matchmaking process and an elaborating process of the result by collaborative agents. The domain-specific heuristics used in the agent-based support process are formalized, and each agent in two processes is designed. Finally, a prototypical system based on the design is demonstrated.",,第2页.xls

63,Modeling and simulating human teamwork behaviors using intelligent agents,2004,"Among researchers in multi-agent systems there has been growing interest in using intelligent agents to model and simulate human teamwork behaviors. Teamwork modeling is important for training humans in gaining collaborative skills, for supporting humans in making critical decisions by proactively gathering, fusing, and sharing information, and for building coherent teams with both humans and agents working effectively on intelligence-intensive problems. Teamwork modeling is also challenging because the research has spanned diverse disciplines from business management to cognitive science, human discourse, and distributed artificial intelligence. This article presents an extensive, but not exhaustive, list of work in the field, where the taxonomy is organized along two main dimensions: team social structure and social behaviors. Along the dimension of social structure, we consider agent-only teams and mixed human-agent teams. Along the dimension of social behaviors, we consider collaborative behaviors, communicative behaviors, helping behaviors, and the underpinning of effective teamwork-shared mental models. The contribution of this article is that it presents an organizational framework for analyzing a variety of teamwork simulation systems and for further studying simulated teamwork behaviors.",,第2页.xls

68,A New Distributed Computing Environment Based on Mobile Agents for SPMD Applications,2016,"In this paper, we propose a new distributed environment for High Performance Computing (HPC) based on mobile agents.

The distributed program to be performed is encapsulated on team leader agent which deploys its team workers as Agent Virtual Processing Unit (AVPU). Each AVPU is asked to perform its assigned tasks and provides the computational results which make the data and team works tasks management difficult for the team leader agent and that influence the performance computing.

69,Reactive Programming Collaborative Agents for Self-Managing Software Teams,2016,"In self-managing software teams, developers with complementary skills collaborate with each other to improve productivity and increase innovation. Due to nature of innovation, managers in these teams will acquire only summarized information from developers to avoid micromanagement. They will not plan fine-grained activities but leave responsibility and autonomy to self-managing developers. Developers discover collaboration opportunities from up-to-date assets and decide needed collaborative activities. To maintain effective and consistent collaboration, distributed knowledge of decision making from up-to-date assets must be captured and accumulated for these teams. This study proposes a method to distribute asset monitoring and decision making through reactive agents. Reactive programming technique is used to collaborate reactive agents. These agents present asset changes as event streams and provide time-varying reactions to each other as a network. The network can automatically react to decisions made by every agent. Through this method, self-managing software teams build their reactive knowledge network which responds to asset changes instantly and reveals collaboration opportunities intelligently.",,第2页.xls
70,In AI We Trust: Characteristics Influencing Assortment Planners' Perceptions of AI Based Recommendation Agents,2018,"While creating an optimal assortment of products, assortment planners need to take into account an important amount of information, which leads to a certain level of uncertainty. These trade-offs can diminish the quality of the assortment decisions made by the planners. To reduce their impact, assortment planners can now use artificial intelligence (AI) based recommendation agents (RAs) throughout their decision-making process, thus benefiting from their ability to process a large quantity of information to improve their decisions. However, research on user-RA shows that there are some challenges to their adoption. For instance, RA adoption depends on the users perceived credibility of its recommendations. Hence, this study investigates how the richness of the information provided by the RA and the necessary effort to access this information influences the assortment planners' usage behavior (visual attention) and perceptions (credibility, satisfaction, performance, intention to adopt the RA). A within-subject lab experiment was conducted with twenty participants. The results show the importance of the RA's recommendations that include easily accessible explanations of the variables included in their calculations on the usage behavior, perceptions, and decision quality of the assortment planners. These findings contribute to the HCI literature and the theory of RA adoption in B2B contexts by providing insights on features enhancing employee adoption.",,第2页.xls
71,Opportunities for Human-AI Collaboration in Remote Sighted Assistance,2022,"Remote sighted assistance (RSA) has emerged as a conversational assistive technology for people with visual impairments (VI), where remote sighted agents provide realtime navigational assistance to users with visual impairments via video-chat-like communication. In this paper, we conducted a literature review and interviewed 12 RSA users to comprehensively understand technical and navigational challenges in RSA for both the agents and users. Technical challenges are organized into four categories: agents' difficulties in orienting and localizing the users; acquiring the users' surroundings and detecting obstacles; delivering information and understanding user-specific situations; and coping with a poor network connection. Navigational challenges are presented in 15 real-world scenarios (8 outdoor, 7 indoor) for the users. Prior work indicates that computer vision (CV) technologies, especially interactive 3D maps and realtime localization, can address a subset of these challenges. However, we argue that addressing the full spectrum of these challenges warrants new development in Human-CV collaboration, which we formalize as five emerging problems: making object recognition and obstacle avoidance algorithms blind-aware; localizing users under poor networks; recognizing digital content on LCD screens; recognizing texts on irregular surfaces; and predicting the trajectory of out-of-frame pedestrians or objects. Addressing these problems can advance computer vision research and usher into the next generation of RSA service.",,第2页.xls

74,Diversifying behaviors for learning in Asymmetric Multiagent Systems,2022,"To achieve coordination in multiagent systems such as air traffic control or search and rescue, agents must not only evolve their policies, but also adapt to the behaviors of other agents. However, extending coevolutionary algorithms to complex domains is difficult because agents evolve in the dynamic environment created by the changing policies of other agents. This problem is exacerbated when the teams consist of diverse asymmetric agents (agents with different capabilities and objectives), making it difficult for agents to evolve complementary policies. Quality-Diversity methods solve part of the problem by allowing agents to discover not just optimal, but diverse behaviors, but are computationally intractable in multiagent settings. This paper introduces a multiagent learning framework to allow asymmetric agents to specialize and explore diverse behaviors needed for coordination in a shared environment. The key insight of this work is that a hierarchical decomposition of diversity search, fitness optimization, and team composition modeling allows the fitness on the team-wide objective to direct the diversity search in a dynamic environment. Experimental results in multiagent environments with temporal and spatial coupling requirements demonstrate the diversity of acquired agent synergies in response to a changing environment and team compositions.",,第2页.xls

For this purpose, the agent adapts its extent of assistance based on the necessity of the given situation. The concept was implemented for the use case of manned-unmanned teaming in future military helicopter missions.

Results show the advantages of the scalable mixed-initiative concept especially in time critical and high workload situations.",,第2页.xls
78,Agent-based Project Team Collaboration Behavior Simulation,2016,"This study is aimed at modeling the efficiency of collaboration behaviors of project team members, and then developing a simulator to link real project information to the addressed model, so that we can realize the possible cooperation results of a project team by experimental observations. To this end, the social network philosophy is adopted to create the team member interaction mechanism, and the agent-based modeling and simulation methodology is applied to develop the virtual team with software agents. The Project Team Collaboration Efficiency Simulator (PTCES) is implemented. Using PTCES, the communication work (CW) time, rework (RW) time, and the original planed work (PW) time spent by team members with their communication social network can be computed so that both the single activity efficiency and the whole process efficiency can also be evaluated. With a real case study of building construction project, the soundness of the PTCES is validated. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis is completed to illustrate that actors' willing to communicate is the critical factor to collaboration efficiency, and the experiments show that 27% delay would be resulted from the structural hole in the communication social network.",,第2页.xls
79,Evolving Team Compositions by Agent Swapping,2013,"Optimizing collective behavior in multiagent systems requires algorithms to find not only appropriate individual behaviors but also a suitable composition of agents within a team. Over the last two decades, evolutionary methods have emerged as a promising approach for the design of agents and their compositions into teams. The choice of a crossover operator that facilitates the evolution of optimal team composition is recognized to be crucial, but so far, it has never been thoroughly quantified. Here, we highlight the limitations of two different crossover operators that exchange entire agents between teams: restricted agent swapping (RAS) that exchanges only corresponding agents between teams and free agent swapping (FAS) that allows an arbitrary exchange of agents. Our results show that RAS suffers from premature convergence, whereas FAS entails insufficient convergence. Consequently, in both cases, the exploration and exploitation aspects of the evolutionary algorithm are not well balanced resulting in the evolution of suboptimal team compositions. To overcome this problem, we propose combining the two methods. Our approach first applies FAS to explore the search space and then RAS to exploit it. This mixed approach is a much more efficient strategy for the evolution of team compositions compared to either strategy on its own. Our results suggest that such a mixed agent-swapping algorithm should always be preferred whenever the optimal composition of individuals in a multiagent system is unknown.",,第2页.xls

83,Escape from the factory of the robot monsters: agents of change,2017,"Purpose - The increasing use of robotics within modern factories and workplaces not only sees us becoming more dependent on this technology but it also introduces innovative ways by which humans interact with complex systems. As agent-based systems become more integrated into work environments, the traditional human team becomes more integrated with agent-based automation and, in some cases, autonomous behaviours. This paper discusses these interactions in terms of team composition and how a human-agent collective can share goals via the delegation of authority between human and agent team members. Design/methodology/approach - This paper highlights the increasing integration of robotics in everyday life and examines the nature of how new novel teams may be constructed with the use of intelligent systems and autonomous agents. Findings - Areas of human factors and human-computer interaction are used to discuss the benefits and limitations of human-agent teams. Research limitations/implications - There is little research in (human-robot) (H-R) teamwork, especially from a human factors perspective. Practical implications - Advancing the authors understanding of the H-R team (and associated intelligent agent systems) will assist in the integration of such systems in everyday practices. Social implications - H-R teams hold a great deal of social and organisational issues that need further exploring. Only through understanding this context can advanced systems be fully realised. Originality/value - This paper is multidisciplinary, drawing on areas of psychology, computer science, robotics and human-computer Interaction. Specific attention is given to an emerging field of autonomous software agents that are growing in use. This paper discusses the uniqueness of the human-agent teaming that results when human and agent members share a common goal within a team.",,第2页.xls

85,Reaching Unanimous Agreements Within Agent-Based Negotiation Teams With Linear and Monotonic Utility Functions,2012,"In this article, an agent-based negotiation model for negotiation teams that negotiate a deal with an opponent is presented. Agent-based negotiation teams are groups of agents that join together as a single negotiation party because they share an interest that is related to the negotiation process. The model relies on a trusted mediator that coordinates and helps team members in the decisions that they have to take during the negotiation process: which offer is sent to the opponent, and whether the offers received from the opponent are accepted. The main strength of the proposed negotiation model is the fact that it guarantees unanimity within team decisions since decisions report a utility to team members that is greater than or equal to their aspiration levels at each negotiation round. This work analyzes how unanimous decisions are taken within the team and the robustness of the model against different types of manipulations. An empirical evaluation is also performed to study the impact of the different parameters of the model.",,第2页.xls
86,Effect of human biases on human-agent teams,2010,"As human-agent teams get increasingly deployed in the real-world, agent designers need to take into account that humans and agents have different abilities to specify preferences. In this paper, we focus on how human biases in specifying preferences for resources impacts the performance of large, heterogeneous teams. In particular, we model the inclination of humans to simplify their preference functions and to exaggerate their utility for desired resources, and show the effect of these biases on the team performance. We demonstrate this on two different problems, which are representative of many resource allocation problems addressed in literature. In both these problems, the agents and humans optimize their constraints in a distributed manner. This paper makes two key contributions: (a) Proves theoretical properties of the algorithm used (named DSA) for solving distributed constraint optimization problems, which ensures robustness against human biases; and (b) Empirically illustrates that the effect of human biases on team performance for different problem settings and for varying team sizes is not significant. Both our theoretical and empirical studies support the fact that the solutions provided by DSA for mid to large sized teams are very robust to the common types of human biases.",,第2页.xls
87,HogRider: Champion Agent of Microsoft Malmo Collaborative AI Challenge,2018,"It has been an open challenge for self-interested agents to make optimal sequential decisions in complex multiagent systems, where agents might achieve higher utility via collaboration. The Microsoft Malmo Collaborative AI Challenge (MCAC), which is designed to encourage research relating to various problems in Collaborative AI, takes the form of a Minecraft mini-game where players might work together to catch a pig or deviate from cooperation, for pursuing high scores to win the challenge. Various characteristics, such as complex interactions among agents, uncertainties, sequential decision making and limited learning trials all make it extremely challenging to find effective strategies. We present HogRider - the champion agent of MCAC in 2017 out of 81 teams from 26 countries. One key innovation of HogRider is a generalized agent type hypothesis framework to identify the behavior model of the other agents, which is demonstrated to be robust to observation uncertainty. On top of that, a second key innovation is a novel Q-learning approach to learn effective policies against each type of the collaborating agents. Various ideas are proposed to adapt traditional Q-learning to handle complexities in the challenge, including state-action abstraction to reduce problem scale, a warm start approach using human reasoning for addressing limited learning trials, and an active greedy strategy to balance exploitation-exploration. Challenge results show that HogRider outperforms all the other teams by a significant edge, in terms of both optimality and stability.",,第2页.xls
88,Formal methods in robotics,2004,"Summary form only given. AI research in robotics started out with the hypothesis that logical modelling and reasoning plays a key role. This assumption was seriously questioned by behaviour-based and Nouvelle AI approaches. The credo by this school of thinking is that explicit modelling of the environment and reasoning about it is too brittle and computationally too expensive. Instead, a purely reactive approach is favoured. With the increase of computing power, we have seen over the last two decades, the argument about the computational costs is not really convincing any more. Furthermore, also the brittleness argument ceases to be convincing, once we start to incorporate probabilities and utilities. The author argues that it is indeed feasible to use computation intensive approaches based on explicit models of the environments to control a robot and achieve competitive performance. Most of the time, one has to go beyond purely logical approaches, though, because it is necessary to be better than an opponent. For this reason, decision theory and game theory become important ingredients. However, purely logical approaches can have its place if we want to guarantee worst-case properties. He demonstrates these claims using examples from our robotic soccer team, our football robot and our simulated rescue agent team.",,第2页.xls
89,Augmenting the Transplant Team With Artificial Intelligence: Toward Meaningful AI Use in Solid Organ Transplant,2021,"Advances in systems immunology, such as new biomarkers, offer the potential for highly personalized immunosuppression regimens that could improve patient outcomes. In the future, integrating all of this information with other patient history data will likely have to rely on artificial intelligence (AI). AI agents can help augment transplant decision making by discovering patterns and making predictions for specific patients that are not covered in the literature or in ways that are impossible for humans to anticipate by integrating vast amounts of data (e.g. trending across numerous biomarkers). Similar to other clinical decision support systems, AI may help overcome human biases or judgment errors. However, AI is not widely utilized in transplant to date. In this rapid review, we survey the methods employed in recent research in transplant-related AI applications and identify concerns related to implementing these tools. We identify three key challenges (bias/accuracy, clinical decision process/AI explainability, AI acceptability criteria) holding back AI in transplant. We also identify steps that can be taken in the near term to help advance meaningful use of AI in transplant (forming a Transplant AI Team at each center, establishing clinical and ethical acceptability criteria, and incorporating AI into the Shared Decision Making Model).",,第2页.xls

95,Roots and Requirements for Collaborative AI [arXiv],2023,"The vision of AI collaborators has long been a staple of science fiction, where artificial agents understand nuances of collaboration and human communication. They bring advantages to their human collaborators and teams by contributing their special talents. Government advisory groups and leaders in AI have advocated for years that AIs should be human compatible and be capable of effective collaboration. Nonetheless, robust AIs that can collaborate like talented people remain out of reach. This position paper draws on a cognitive analysis of what effective and robust collaboration requires of human and artificial agents. It sketches a history of public and AI visions for artificial collaborators, starting with early visions of intelligence augmentation (IA) and artificial intelligence (AI).

96,Empathic Interactions in Automated Vehicles #EmpathicCHI,2021,"Automation in driving will change the role of the drivers from actor to passive supervisor. Although the vehicle will be responsible for driving manoeuvres, drivers will need to rely on automation and understand its decisions to establish a trusting relationship between them and the vehicle. Progress has been made in conversational agents and affective machines recently. Moreover, it seems to be promising in this establishment of trust between humans and machines. We believe it is essential to investigate the use of emotional conversational agents in the automotive context to build a solid relationship between the driver and the vehicle. In this workshop, we aim at gathering researchers and industry practitioners from different fields of HCI, ML/AI, NLU and psychology to brainstorm about affective machines, empathy and conversational agent with a particular focus on human-vehicle interaction. Questions like What would be the specificities of a multimodal and empathic agent in a car?, How the agent could make the driver aware of the situation? and How to measure the trust between the user and the autonomous vehicle? will be addressed in this workshop.",,第2页.xls
97,Learning Transferable Cooperative Behavior in Multi-Agent Teams [arXiv],2019,"While multi-agent interactions can be naturally modeled as a graph, the environment has traditionally been considered as a black box. We propose to create a shared agent-entity graph, where agents and environmental entities form vertices, and edges exist between the vertices which can communicate with each other. Agents learn to cooperate by exchanging messages along the edges of this graph. Our proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is invariant to the number of agents or entities present in the system as well as permutation invariance, both of which are desirable properties for any multi-agent system representation. We present state-of-the-art results on coverage, formation and line control tasks for multi-agent teams in a fully decentralized framework and further show that the learned policies quickly transfer to scenarios with different team sizes along with strong zero-shot generalization performance. This is an important step towards developing multi-agent teams which can be realistically deployed in the real world without assuming complete prior knowledge or instantaneous communication at unbounded distances.",,第2页.xls
98,Human-Machine Interface for Multi-agent Systems Management Using the Descriptor Function Framework,2016,"Human-machine interfaces for command and control of teams of autonomous agents is an enabling technology for the development of reliable multi-agent systems. Tools for proper modelling of these systems are sought in order to ease the creation of efficient interface that allow a single operator to control several agents, as well as monitor the execution state of the tasks the team is demanded to accomplish. If humans are present in the environment, the agents must sense their presence and collaborate with them toward the mission accomplishment. In this context, the descriptor function framework is a versatile tool that allows the human integration at two levels: the development of human-machine interfaces and the achievement of human-machine teaming. In this paper, we show how such results can be obtained and we propose a possible architecture for the framework implementation.",,第2页.xls

100,Social robots as persuasive agents,2014,"The topic of human robot interaction (HRI) is an important part of human computer interaction (HCI). Robots are more and more used in a social context, and in this paper we try to formulate a research agenda concerning ethical issues around social HRI in order to be prepared for future scenarios where robots may be a naturally integrated part of human society. We outline different paradigms to describe the role of social robots in communication processes with humans, and connect HRI with the topic of persuasive technology in health care, to critically reflect the potential benefits of using social robots as persuasive agents. The ability of a robotic system to conform to the demands (behaviors, understanding, roles, and tasks) that arise from the place the robot is designed to perform, affect the user and his/er sense of place attachment. Places are constantly changing, and so do interactions, thus robotic systems should continually adjust to change by modifying their behavior accordingly.",,第2页.xls
101,Emergence of cooperative behavior using ADG; Automatically defined groups,1999,"In producing a multi-agent team which solves the problem cooperatively by means of Genetic Programming(GP), it seems that a heterogeneous team performs better than a homogeneous team. Ina heterogeneous team, however, as the number of agents increases, the size of search space becomes vast and the efficiency of search decreases. One of the solutions of this problem is to divide a team into the proper number of groups, and to provide the same program for the all agents belonging to the same group. However it is difficult to know the adequate team structure beforehand. In order to solve these problems, we have proposed a method called ADG; Automatically Defined Groups. In this paper, we applied this method to a simple load transportation problem and a modified The World problem, and confirmed that the optimal team structure was acquired in each problem.",,第2页.xls
102,The AML Approach to Modeling Dynamic Organization of Combat Team,2010,"Modeling the dynamic organization of the combat team based on MAS(Multi-Agent System) is an effective way to enhance its automatic and cooperative decision capability in dynamic, uncertain, complex, and hostile air combat environment. The AML(Agent Modeling Language) is a semi-formal visual modeling language for specifying, modeling and documenting systems that incorporate features drawn from multi-agent systems theory, which can provide software engineers with a ready-to-use, complete and highly expressive modeling language suitable for the development of commercial software solutions based on multi-agent technologies. In this paper, we try to apply AML in modeling organization of the combat team. First, the model of the organization structure of combat team based on MAS, such as the structure, role, and combat goal of the combat team, are modeled by means of agent structure diagram and activity diagram. And then, the evolvement process of the combat team, which include the member change, combat role change etc., are modeled by communication sequence diagram etc.",,第2页.xls

Five key components, namely control, communication, artificial intelligence (AI), platform, and visualization, merge seamlessly into a holistic framework to deliver this rapid situational awareness development capability to the heterogeneous manned unmanned team (MUM-I). In this framework, the overall control is seen as a combination of agent level control and mission level control A common software, Robot Operating System (ROS), is used to establish communication, and consequently consensus, among the heterogeneous swarm of unmanned systems. These unmanned platforms are customized with co-processing hardware that can execute advanced artificial intelligence machine learning (AI/ML) modules to not only deliver stable and cooperative performance of these unmanned platforms in the swarm but also support human-centric human robot interaction (HRI).

111,Alexa Prize - State of the Art in Conversational AI,2018,"To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a $2.5 million competition that challenges university teams to build conversational agents, or socialbots, that can converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics for 20 minutes. The Alexa Prize offers the academic community a unique opportunity to perform research at scale with real conversational data obtained by interacting with millions of Alexa users, along with user-provided ratings and feedback, over several months. This opportunity enables teams to effectively iterate, improve, and evaluate their socialbots throughout the competition. Eighteen teams were selected for the inaugural competition last year. To build their socialbots, the students combined state-of-the-art techniques with their own novel strategies in the areas of natural language understanding and conversational AI. This article reports on the research conducted over the 2017-2018 year.

The team task consists of human subjects playing the role of military commanders and cooperatively planning to move their respective units to a common rendezvous point, given time and resource constraints. The objective of the experiment was to compare the effectiveness of agent-based aids for individual and team tasks, as opposed to the baseline condition of manual route planning. There were two experimental conditions: the aided condition, where a route-planning agent (RPA) finds a least-cost plan between the start and rendezvous points for a given composition of force units, and the baseline condition, where the commanders determine initial routes manually and receive basic feedback about the route. We demonstrate that the aided condition provides significantly better assistance for individual route planning and team-based re-planning.",,第2页.xls
114,"Multiple roles, multiple teams, dynamic environment: autonomous Netrek agents",1997,"Describes the architecture and performance of autonomous agents that play the complex, multi-faceted Internet game called Netrek. To perform competently within Netrek, an agent must be capable of (1) reacting in real-time to arcade-like tasks and environment changes within the local surroundings, (2) reasoning about strategy and long-term tasks at a slower pace and on a global scale, and (3) coordinating both with team-mates and against members of the opposing team. Agents capable of operating within the Netrek environment, therefore, require a reactive, flexible, multi-level framework. We describe in detail our current agent implementation, which is based upon the UMPRS (University of Michigan Procedural Reasoning System) architecture. As multi-agent coordination plays a significant role within the Netrek domain, we describe recent research in extending the current communication-based intra-team coordination scheme with a plan recognition scheme that enhances both intra- and inter-team coordination.",,第2页.xls
115,Effects of Agent Transparency on Human-Autonomy Teaming Effectiveness,2016,"Two human factors studies were conducted to assess the effectiveness of intelligent agents' user interfaces that were designed based on the Situation awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) model. Results show that agents' transparency (based on the SAT model) can benefit operator performance and support proper calibration of trust in the agents. Increasing levels of transparency enhanced operator's perceived trust in the agents, but only to a degree. When uncertainty was added to the interface, operator's trust did not further increase. Finally, the subjective workload data suggest that the benefits of increasing agent transparency do not have to be associated with higher levels of operator workload.",,第2页.xls

117,Certainty and expertness-based credit assignment for cooperative Q-learning agents with an AND-type task,2002,"In multiagent reinforcement learning, inter agent credit assignment is a fundamental problem, since a single scalar reinforcement signal is the only reliable feedback that teams of learning agents receive. This problem is more critical in groups of independent learners with a joint task.In this research, it is assumed that a critic agent receives the environment feedback and assigns a proper credit to each agent using some measures. Three of such measures for a team of cooperative agents with a parallel and AND-type task are introduced. These measures somehow compare the agents' knowledge. One of these criteria, called Normal Expertness, is a non-relative measure while two other ones (Certainty and Relative Normal.Expertness) are relative measure.It is experimentally shown that relative measures work better as they contain more information for the critic agent.",,第2页.xls
118,Simulation results for the ARS-PA model,2007,"The project ARS (Artificial Recognition System) develops a novel approach to decision making in the domain of building automation systems. Concepts from neurology, psychology, and psychoanalysis are used for this approach. We give a short overview about this decision making concept, the simulation environment, and results from simulation experiments. These simulation runs consist of several autonomous agents grouped to two teams which are competing for restricted resources. ARS deals with agents as an intermediate step towards buildings. For some resources cooperation among team mates is necessary. One team is using the ARS approach including concepts like emotions, drives, and desires. Further, it uses a value system inspired by social levels to stimulate cooperation among the team mates. The other team-as a reference-is realized by using a simple rule based decision making approach. The simulation results show an improvement in team-survival due to the introduction of social levels.",,第2页.xls
119,A framework for implementing deliberative agents in computer games,2006,"With the emergence of complex computer games and advanced gaming hardware, possibilities for overcoming some of the deficiencies in traditional game AI are becoming feasible. These deficiencies (repetitive, predictable, inhuman behaviour) are caused by the reliance on simple, reactive AI techniques for in game characters, and can be overcome by using more sophisticated AI and agent techniques. The aim of our research is to create new forms of intelligent characters (agents) that will exhibit human-like intelligence and provide more challenging and entertaining virtual opponents and team mates for computer games. We present here an overview of the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) model of agency, and its applicability to computer games, and present our prototype application that implements a BDI agent system within the 3D computer game Unreal Tournament via GameBots and JavaBots technology. We also outline our future goals for improving the system via the introduction of multi agent scenarios that require cooperation between self-interested autonomous entities.",,第2页.xls
120,The Role of Psychophysiological Measures as Implicit Communication Within Mixed-Initiative Teams,2018,"There has been considerable effort, particularly in the military, at integrating automated agents into human teams. Currently, automated agents lack the ability to intelligently adapt to a dynamic operational environment, which results in them acting as tools rather than teammates. Rapidly advancing technology is enabling the development of autonomous agents that are able to actively make team-oriented decisions meaning truly intelligent autonomous agents are on the horizon. This makes the understanding of what is important to team performance a critical goal. In human teams, mission success depends on the development of a shared mental models and situation awareness. Development of these constructs requires good intra-team communication. However, establishing effective intra-team communication in a mixed-initiative team represents a current bottleneck in achieving successful teams. There has been significant research aimed at identifying modes of communication that can be used both by human and agent teammates, but often neglects a source of communication or information for the agent teammate that has been adopted by the human robot community to increase robot acceptance. Specifically, the use of psychophysiological features supplied to the agent that can then use algorithms to infer the cognitive state of the human teammate. The utility of using psychophysiological features for communication within teams has not been widely explored yet representing a knowledge gap in developing mixed-initiative teams. We designed an experimental paradigm that created an integrated human-automation team where psychophysiological data was collected and analyzed in real-time to address this knowledge gap. We briefly present a general background to human automation teaming before presenting our research and preliminary analysis.",,第2页.xls
121,Respecting Human Autonomy through Human-Centered AI,2020,"AI is becoming more pervasive in our everyday lives and people are increasingly having to relinquish control and decision-making to smart systems. Concurrently, people are confronted with a reduced sense of autonomy as a result of being monitored and guided in their actions by complex and autonomous technologies they do not fully understand or control. HCI researchers are investigating how to design intelligible and human-centered autonomous systems to increase trust and address various ethical and societal challenges. In this workshop, we want to deepen and expand the discussion on tensions between human and machine autonomy when designing AI systems, focusing on scientific, technological and ethical challenges that it poses. We will adopt a pragmatic and multidisciplinary approach to look into how human-centered approaches could enhance human autonomy/agency when interacting with intelligent autonomous systems.",,第2页.xls
122,Effects of agent timing on the human-agent team,2017,"As technology becomes more sophisticated, autonomous agents are applied more frequently to improve system performance. The current research employed a five step method, including modeling, simulation, and human experimentation to explore the effect of an artificial agent's timing on the performance of a human-agent team within a highly dynamic task environment. Agent timing significantly influenced the role assumed by the human within the team. Further, agent timing changed system performance by approximately 40% within the experimental conditions. Results indicate that an artificial agent's timing can be varied as a function of the task demands placed upon the human-agent team to maintain an appropriate level of human activity and engagement. Therefore, agent timing may be controlled to adapt autonomy to provide an apparent continuum along which to control human engagement in systems employing human-agent teaming within dynamic environments.

123,New Solution for Resource Allocation Problem of Agent Teams Governed by a Leader,2009,"Previously, we had proposed a multi-agent model for simulating the differentiation between a leader and its followers. However, in higher population settings, this model suffers from the leader's loss of its functionality. To solve this problem, we designed a new method that helps the leader to survive in such situations. By making use of psychological facts, this method employed two teams of agents assigning the adequate resources to another team's leader each other. In noiseless settings, we found that this method leads to some deadlock. Adding noise prevented this deadlock, although it collapsed the leader of the other team alternately. Another negotiation model was exploited to cope with this situation. This model succeeded in solving the first problem by providing a different mechanism to maintain the leader's reputation.",,第2页.xls
124,Towards flexible teamwork,1997,"Many AI researchers are striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete and inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. The key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing the requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents a model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions; teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a partial hierarchy of joint intentions. Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains and presents detailed empirical results.",,第2页.xls

We describe one such competition, the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM). We discuss its significance in the context of today's global market economy as well as AI research, the ways in which it breaks away from limiting assumptions made in prior work, and some of the advances it has engendered over the past six years. TAC SCM requires autonomous supply chain entities, modeled as agents, to coordinate their internal operations while concurrently trading in multiple dynamic and highly competitive markets.

126,Intention reconciliation by collaborative agents,2000,"Research on resource-bounded agents has established that rational agents need to be able to revise their commitments in the light of new opportunities. In the context of collaborative activities rational agents must be able to reconcile their intentions to do team-related actions with other conflicting intentions. The SPIRE experimental system allows the process of intention reconciliation in team contexts to be simulated and studied. Prior work with SPIRE examined the effect of team norms, environmental factors, and agent utility functions on individual and group outcomes for homogeneous groups of agents. This paper extends these results to situations involving heterogeneous groups in which agents use different utility functions. The paper provides new illustrations of the ways in which SPIRE can reveal unpredicted interactions among the variables involved, and it suggests preliminary principles for designers of collaborative agents.",,第2页.xls
127,Allocating structured tasks in heterogeneous agent teams,2019,"Task allocation is an important aspect of multiagent coordination. However, there are many challenges in developing appropriate strategies for multiagent teams so that they operate efficiently. Real-world scenarios such as flooding disasters usually require the use of heterogeneous robots and the execution of tasks with different structures and complexities. In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation mechanism considering different types of tasks for heterogeneous agent teams where agents play different roles and carry out tasks according to their own capabilities. We have run several experiments to evaluate the proposed mechanism. The results show that the proposed mechanism appears to scale well and provides near-optimal allocations.",,第2页.xls
128,SYMBIOTIC LEARNING IN COMMERCIAL COMPUTER GAMES,2005,"This paper proposes an approach for learning team behaviour to improve agent intelligence in team-oriented commercial computer games. The approach, named 'symbiotic learning', focuses on the exploitation of relevant gameplay experiences. The results of an experiment in the game QUAKE III show the symbiotic learning approach to be able to successfully learn effective agent behaviour. We conclude that symbiotic learning can be used during game development practice to automatically validate and produce AI, and, provided a good balance is found between exploitation and exploration, the approach can be applied in practice for the purpose of online learning in commercial computer games.",,第2页.xls
129,Team agent behavior architecture in robot soccer,2008,"One of the most challenging goals in artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop a team of autonomous agents with human-performance. In a team-based multi-agent system with cooperative and opponent team agents, the ability to build a coordinated system of game strategies can be useful to provide the agents with team plans to achieve common goals. These team plans are used to make agents decide which behavior is the best in a given situation, specially in a realistic setting of situated agents with local perception and uncertain domains. In this paper we present a team agent behavior architecture (TABA), an approach to coordinate the behavior of a multiagent team. We introduce an autonomous and dynamic leader agent capable of analyzing the current environment, including the opponent team, and select a team plan according to the state of the world; this agent is selected among one of our cooperative team agents. The roles of the robots are not fixed and they can dynamically exchange their roles with each other. The plan selected is pre-defined and is communicated to the rest of the agents who execute it in a distributed fashion. We also propose a soccer strategy description symbols (SSDS) that is very simple and intuitive. TABA is built using a hierarchical architecture. The first stage is responsible for leader agent selection; the second stage is for strategy selection; the third stage is for role assignment and last stage is for tactic execution, in which robots execute their behavior commands based on their roles. We have successfully followed a case-based reasoning approach for strategy selection in the robot soccer domain, a simulation of the RoboCup four-legged league soccer competition. Initial results of TABA are also discussed.",,第2页.xls
130,A support method for match-making using agent's persuasion mechanism considering user's psychological states,2002,"With the rapid progress of computer networks, various group cooperation activities are being performed. Whether a group can work efficiently greatly depends on whether personalities of group members can be harmonized. Therefore, it is necessary to establish (form) the groups and project teams by persons with different skills using the Internet or intranet dynamically and flexibly, such that their personalities are matched. In this paper, we propose a support method for forming project teams using agents. A project team is formed with negotiation and persuasion between agents. The persuasion mechanism is developed based on the balance theory of psychology, in order to represent and reflect the attitude change in the persuasion process between persons as correctly as possible.",,第2页.xls

We use Asynchronous Teams (or A-Teams) technique to search for an optimal global solution. An A-Team is an organization of agents that communicate with each other by means of shared memories. Each agent is a heuristic strategy that can make its own choices about its inputs, scheduling and resource allocation.

132,Evolving the cooperative behaviour in Unreal bots,2010,"This paper presents an approach to the evolution of the cooperative behaviour of some bots inside the PC game Unreal. We intend to create bots that cooperate as a team trying to beat other teams (composed of human players or bots). So, in addition to the improvement of the default artificial intelligence (AI) of bots, we have performed an improvement of the team AI. We have applied an evolutionary algorithm which optimizes the parameters considered in the hard-coded states inside the bot AI code, mainly those related to the cooperation. Two different approaches have been tested inside some different battle arenas: one considering a different set of parameters for every bot in the team, and the other one considering the same set of parameters for all the teammates. The results show that both methods yield better teams than the standard ones. The teams which share the same behaviour parameters, get a higher score than those with bots playing with different parameters.",,第2页.xls

135,Constructing competitive and cooperative agent behavior using coevolution,2010,"In nature, multiple agents in teams collaborate and compete with one another at the same time. Replicating such agent interactions in games can make for realistic opponent teams. Yet cooperation and competition have mostly been studied separately so far. This paper focuses on simultaneous cooperative and competitive coevolution in a complex predator-prey domain. Multi-Agent ESP [23] architecture is first used to evolve neural networks to control predator and prey agents, but such a naive combination of otherwise successful architectures turns out not to sustain an arms race. An extended architecture consisting of multiple cooperating neural networks within each agent is therefore introduced. This architecture successfully results in hierarchical cooperation and competition in teams of prey and predators: In sustained coevolution, high-level pursuit-evasion behaviors emerge. In this manner, coevolution of neural networks is shown to scale up to an arms race of multiple competing and cooperating agents, more closely modeling coevolution of complex behavior in nature.",,第2页.xls
136,Multiparty proactive communication: a perspective for evolving shared mental models,2007,"Helping behavior in effective teams is enabled by some overlapping shared mental models that are developed and maintained by members of the team. In this paper, we take the perspective that multiparty proactive communication is critical for establishing and maintaining such a shared mental model among teammates, which is the basis for agents to offer proactive help and to achieve coherent teamwork. We first provide formal semantics for multiparty proactive performatives within a team setting. We then examine how such performatives result in updates to mental model of teammates, and how such updates can trigger helpful behaviors from other teammates.",,第2页.xls
137,A new parallel and distributed framework based on mobile agents for HPC: SPMD applications,2015,This paper proposes a new distributed framework and its main components for HPC (High Performance Computing). It is based on a cooperative mobile agents model which implements the team works strategies to perform parallel programs execution as distributed one. The program and data to be performed is encapsulated on team leader agent which deploys its worker agents AVPUs (Agent Virtual Processing Units). All the AVPUs have to move to a specific node and perform and provide their computational results. Consider the great number of data and of the AVPUs to be managed by the team leader agent and which alter negatively the HPC. In this work we focused on introducing a specific mobile agent the MPA (Mobile Provider Agent) which implements some mechanisms for the management of data and tasks and the AVPUs to ensure a load balancing model. It applies also some additional strategies to maintain the others performance keys thanks to the mobile agents several skills.,,第2页.xls
138,Applying Deep Reinforcement Learning to Train AI Agents in a Wargaming Framework,2024,"The United States Navy's mission planning process consists of six steps. The third step, referred to as the course of action (COA) analysis (wargaming) process, encompasses the evaluation of initial actions taken, the corresponding reactions by opponents, and the associated counteractions. This entire process supports developing potential mission COAs while also informing decision makers of potential outcomes in support of planning and preparing for operations. This wargaming process may occur using table-top exercises with subject-matter experts that determine actions taken. However, continued improvements with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a sub-field of machine learning, provide an opportunity to leverage the use of artificial intelligence (AI) agents within the wargaming process. The AI agents must perform credibly to represent a believable behavior of either the red team or blue team. Developing credible behavior requires tailoring agent reward functions, analyzing impacts of different training algorithms and parameter values, and understanding and evaluating the resulting behavior. This work also demonstrates agent behavior using a browser-based gameplay interface accessible to decision makers. This paper provides an overview of research efforts to train and analyze AI agent performance using DRL within a prototype government owned wargaming framework, discusses the capabilities and utility of the browser-based interface, and explores challenges and opportunities for future research.",,第2页.xls
139,Human-Robot Teaming for a Cooperative Game in a Shared Partially Observable Space,2023,"An open research question is how to best pair a human and agent (e.g., AI, autonomous) relative to a complex, multi-objective task in a dynamic and unknown partially observable environment. At the heart of this challenge resides even deeper questions like what AI is needed and how can bi-directional and multi-directional human-robot trust be established. In this paper, the theoretical framework for a simple 2D grid world-based cooperative search and rescue game is explored. The resultant prototype interface enables the study of human-robot interaction for human-robot teaming. First, the design and implementation of a prototype interface is discussed. A 2D grid-world was selected to simplify the investigation and eliminate confounding factors that arise in more complicated simulated 3D and real world experiments. Next, different types of autonomous agents are introduced, as they impact our studies and ultimately are an integral element of the underlying research question. This is followed by three levels of increasing complexity open-ended games, easy, medium, and hard. The current paper does not contain human experimentation results. That is the next step in this research. Instead, this article introduces, explains, and defends a set of design choices and working examples are provided to facilitate open discussion.",,第2页.xls
140,Using NEAT for continuous adaptation and teamwork formation in Pacman,2009,"Despite games often being used as a testbed for new computational intelligence techniques, the majority of artificial intelligence in commercial games is scripted. This means that the computer agents are non-adaptive and often inherently exploitable because of it. In this paper, we describe a learning system designed for team strategy development in a real time multi-agent domain. We test our system in the game of Pacman, evolving adaptive strategies for the ghosts in simulated real time against a competent Pacman player. Our agents (the ghosts) are controlled by neural networks, whose weights and structure are incrementally evolved via an implementation of the NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. We demonstrate the design and successful implementation of this system by evolving a number of interesting and complex team strategies that outperform the ghosts' strategies of the original arcade version of the game.",,第2页.xls
141,AI in the White House: expert system diagnoses bounced e-mail,1997,"Every once in a while an AI application comes along that stands out, not only for its technical merit, but more for its strategic merit. The paper discusses such an application at the White House. While it will be largely invisible, nestled into an electronic media affairs distribution system, it is noteworthy for several reasons. First, AI will soon be living at the White House, the powerful symbol of the US government. Second, it exemplifies the kind of support functions AI can perform in this new age of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). Third, this expert system was built by an AI scientist, based on his own expertise, to lighten his own workload. For the Clinton Administration, Comlink was a good way to practice what it preached; to actually get on the information superhighway by making government information widely available to the public via e-mail.",,第2页.xls
142,TEAMLOG in Action: a Case Study in Teamwork,2010,"This article presents a case study of a theoretical multi-agent system designed to clean up ecological disasters. It focuses on the interactions within a heterogeneous team of agents, outlines their goals and plans, and establishes the necessary distribution of information and commitment throughout the team, including its sub-teams. These aspects of teamwork are presented in the TEAMLOG formalism [20], based on multi-modal logic, in which collective informational and motivational attitudes are first-class citizens. Complex team attitudes are justified to be necessary in the course of teamwork. The article shows how to make a bridge between theoretical foundations of TEAMLOG and an application and illustrates how to tune TEAMLOG to the case study by establishing sufficient, but still minimal levels for the team attitudes.",,第2页.xls
143,Self-organized flocking with agent failure: Off-line optimization and demonstration with real robots,2002,"This paper presents an investigation of flocking by teams of autonomous mobile robots using principles of Swarm Intelligence. First, we present a simple flocking task, and we describe a leaderless distributed flocking algorithm (LD) that is more conducive to implementation on embodied agents than the established algorithms used in computer animation. Next, we use an embodied simulator and reinforcement learning techniques to optimize LD performance under different conditions, showing that this method can be used not only to improve performance but also to gain insight into which algorithm components contribute most to system behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that a group of real robots executing LD with emulated sensors can successfully flock (even in the presence of individual agent failure) and that systematic characterization (and therefore optimization) of real robot flocking performance is achievable.",,第2页.xls
144,Automated assistants to aid humans in understanding team behaviors,2000,"Multi-agent teamwork is critical in a large number ol, agent applications, including training, education, virtual enterprises and collective robotics, Tools that can help humans analyze, evaluate, and understand team behaviors are becoming increasingly important as well. We have taken a step towards building such a tool by creating an automated analyst agent called ISAAC for post-hoc, off-line agent-team analysis, ISAAC's novelty stems from a key design constraint that arises in team analysis: multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. These heterogeneous team models are automatically acquired via machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC employs multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. This paper presents ISAAC's general conceptual framework, motivating its design, as well as its concrete application in the domain of RoboCup soccer. In the RoboCup domain, ISAAC was used prior to and during the RoboCup'99 tournament, and was awarded the RoboCup scientific challenge award.",,第2页.xls
145,A Flexible Multi-Agent Systems Task Environment for Simulating Hybrid Intelligence,2024,"Hybrid Intelligence (HI) attempts to address and solve cognition-intensive tasks by combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) with human intelligence. Due to the novelty of the HI concept, there are few proven patterns for the optimal design of a Hybrid Intelligent System (HIS). To facilitate HIS simulations, we propose a framework to describe and simulate complex tasks in a multi-agent system. The tasks are solved collaboratively by teams of agents, simulating characteristics of actors with human or artificial intelligence. The prototype of a specification-driven task environment was evaluated using two sample applications. The results confirmed the strengths of the concept with regard to the study of different team constellations and cooperation patterns. Extensions would allow modelling of scenarios with higher complexity and more realistic simulation of human behaviors.",,第2页.xls
146,Human Aspects of Project Management: Agent-Based Modeling,2021,"Having tools and techniques of project management are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for project success. If a manager cannot handle people, she or he will have difficulty with managing projects. Many successful projects have teams of people that are involved and committed; however, friction between the team members still occurs due to misunderstandings, conflicts, and personality differences. Project managers must be prepared to deal with these behavioral problems of team members. One way to minimize the impact of behavioral problems is to provide training for all team members (including managers themselves) in interpersonal skills. This area has often been neglected in many organizations; other times, just managers are required to be trained but not team members. This paper presents a unique opportunity for both managers and team members to gain insight into understanding the complex nature of collective behavior. The only way to understand how individual behavioral problems translate into those of a team is to model problems using a bottom-up simulation method like the one presented here. This introductory paper presents basic concepts and a simple application of Agent-based modeling.",,第2页.xls
147,A novel hybrid navigation scheme for reconfigurable multi-agent teams,2006,"In this paper, we propose a hybrid navigation scheme for reconfigurable multi-agent teams. To accomplish a complex task such as search and rescue, agents need to frequently adjust their roles over time according to changes in the task space and in the environment. Furthermore, when exploring an unknown environment, the loss of a team member is likely and the addition of new team members to replace that loss is often necessary. Nevertheless, the loss and addition of members in the agent team should not affect the completion of the task. Our hybrid navigation scheme, consisting of a built-in reconfiguration mechanism and mode-switching navigation functions, reflects these needs by allowing an agent team to reconfigure itself to effectively complete a wide range of tasks. Our design has been implemented in C++ and has been tested by simulation in several typical tasks. We also investigate the effects of imperfect communication on the robustness of the navigation scheme.",,第2页.xls
148,Quantifying Long-Range Interactions and Coherent Structure in Multi-Agent Dynamics,2017,"We develop and apply several novel methods quantifying dynamic multi-agent team interactions. These interactions are detected information-theoretically and captured in two ways: via (i) directed networks (interaction diagrams) representing significant coupled dynamics between pairs of agents, and (ii) state-space plots (coherence diagrams) showing coherent structures in Shannon information dynamics. This model-free analysis relates, on the one hand, the information transfer to responsiveness of the agents and the team, and, on the other hand, the information storage within the team to the team's rigidity and lack of tactical flexibility. The resultant interaction and coherence diagrams reveal implicit interactions, across teams, that may be spatially long-range. The analysis was verified with a statistically significant number of experiments (using simulated football games, produced during RoboCup 2D Simulation League matches), identifying the zones of the most intense competition, the extent and types of interactions, and the correlation between the strength of specific interactions and the results of the matches.",,第2页.xls
149,Efficient Team Formation Based on Learning and Reorganization and Influence of Communication Delay,2011,"We propose a method of distributed team formation that uses reinforcement learning and dynamic reorganization by taking into account communication delay in multi-agent systems (MAS). A task in a distributed environment is usually achieved by doing a number of subtasks that require different functions and resources. These subtasks have to be processed cooperatively in the appropriate team of agents that have the required functions with sufficient resources, but it is difficult to anticipate what kinds of tasks will be requested in the dynamic and open environment during the design stage of the system. It is also unknown whether or not their inter-agent network (that is, the organization of agents) is appropriate to form teams for the given tasks. In addition, communication delay between the agents always occurs in the actual systems, and this often causes a failure or delay of tasks. Therefore, both appropriate team formation and (re)organization suitable for the request patterns of incoming tasks and the environment where agents are deployed are required. The proposed method combines the learning for team formation and reorganization in a way that is adaptive to the environment. This includes task generation patterns and communication delay that may change dynamically. We show that it can improve the overall performance and increase the success rate of team formation in a dynamic environment.",,第2页.xls

According to the relationship of competition and cooperation among the multiple agents, this method adopts the zero-sum Markov game in high layer to compete with the opponent and adopts the team Markov game in low layer to accomplish cooperation in the team. With the application and experiment in robot soccer, it is shown that this method is better than the traditional multi-agent learning method.",,第2页.xls
151,Implementation and Assessment of Robot Team Cooperation Models Using Deliberative Control Components,2012,"This paper proposes an organizational framework and an approach for development of cooperation models for teams of Autonomous Adaptive Vehicles (AAV), using goal-driven control components. The framework and the approach are illustrated through the development and assessment of task allocation in multi-robot teams. Two cooperation models have been implemented: i) a team model based on the Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) theory, where task responsibility is agreed between team peers, by exchanging individual estimations of the degree of difficulty and priority to achieve the task; ii) a hierarchical model where an AAV manager asks team members estimations and then assigns the task. Experimentation for team-cooperation assessment has been done taking into consideration environmental changes, communications and internal failure. The most significant results reported in this work concerns team coordination in stressing situations. The experimental setting and team performance figures are detailed in the paper.",,第2页.xls
152,Programming Languages for AI Programing Agents (Invited Talk),2023,"Over the past decade software development has shifted from a process centered around writing code to a process that increasingly involves composition of external packages and managing the integration of code from other team members. The next decade-plus will be defined by the shift from a process where humans are the central developers of code into one where AI agents, likely Large Language Model (LLM) based, will be the major creators of code and humans will shift to a supervisory role as curators, integrating rich framework-functionality and code developed by AI programming agents. In this new world we must ask ourselves - are programming languages as they exist today fit for purpose and how do they evolve to meet the needs of this future programming model. This talk represents an opinionated take on the question and attempts to outline specific areas of investigation that need to be addressed by the PL community as part of this journey including: What programming language features help/hinder AI agents when understanding and generating code? What programming language features help/hinder human agents when working with an AI Copilot? What programming language tools are needed to empower AI agents in creating grounded and reliable outputs? How can intents be expressed as part of the program representation - examples, constraints, natural language, external documents? How do we empower end-users as part of this transformation? What programming language features are needed to support new AI driven workflows - live coding, interactive requirement gathering, AI TDD? Effectively answering these questions plays a key role in determining if AI driven programming represents a revolution in how software is developed or is limited to being a programming productivity aid for existing development workflows. As such our community should play a central role in understanding this space and leading in the development of this technological transformation!",,第2页.xls

157,Automatically Generate a Specific Human Computer Interaction from an Interface Diagram Model,2018,"The diversity of interaction mode and the constant growth of user requirements bring new challenges to the Human Computer Interaction (HCI). It turns out that the user is interested in interacting with an interactive system according to his level of knowledge. Thus, in this article we have automatically generated the multiplatform HCI that is most adapted to the needs of the users from an interface skeleton. For example, the SEF (Schema d'Enchainement de Fenetre) Windows, which is an interface model allowing to create an interface mockup. It offers more widgets and graphical elements to design an interface. The aim of this paper is automatically generating a new specific HCI from the already existing SEF model. The transformation is based on metamodel and we use the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach. Thus, a transformation rules are created to automatically generate a specific interface.",,第2页.xls
158,AVATAR: Implementation of a Human-Computer Interface Based on an Intelligent Virtual Agent,2019,"For several years the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has been questioned as a reason to diminish the social interaction between people. Although, it is not possible to remove ICT from our lives as we depend on them in many aspects, we can adapt them so that their use allows us to improve our social skills. This is the case of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) and, especially those that involve emotions in a communication with machines similar to human interaction between peers. In this article, the implementation of an HCI based on an intelligent virtual agent is presented, with the possibility of learning basic information about the interlocutor and maintaining a short interaction on topics of general interest. The implementation was made in open-source software, generating not only a tool, but a development platform for other people to make contributions.

In SBT method a team of cooperative intelligent agents could be able to execute complex plans in nondeterministic, adversary, and dynamic environments which communication cost is high. The base idea of this method is to define Scenario for different situations. With a graph of scenarios, a team of agents can execute, learn, adapt, and create team plans automatically. This method has implemented in a soccer team of intelligent agents (players and coach) and evaluated in the standard RoboCup simulator environment [1] and results show a significant improvement.",,第2页.xls
162,"A combined top-down and bottom-up approach to integrated task-decomposition, and allocation",2004,"Two important issues involved in collaborative problem solving are the decomposition of complex tasks into smaller (primitive) subtask and assigning these to the agents in the system. A decomposition done without being aware of the availability of certain agents may not be realistic and may raise a need for decomposing the task again. Task decomposition and task allocation cannot be done in a sequential order but should be interleaved. The dependencies among the tasks and, hence, between the agents that collaborate is extracted from the task decomposition and converted inro rules. A team space, based on a blackboard-like architecture manages dependencies through these rules represented in the rule base. This paper describes an integrated task decomposition and task allocation approach for forming a team, and a team space architecture for managing dependencies through result sharing.",,第2页.xls
163,Team formation by self-interested mobile agents,1998,"A process of team formation by autonomous agents in a distributed environment is presented. Since the environment is distributed, there are serious problems with communication and consistent decision making inside a team. To deal with these problems, the standard technique of token passing in a computer network is applied. The passing cycle of the token serves as the communication route. It assures consistent decision making inside the team maintaining its organizational integrity. On the other hand it constitutes a component of the plan of the cooperative work performed by a complete team. Two algorithms for team formation are given. The first one is based on simple self-interested agents that still can be viewed as reactive agents (see [14]) although augmented with knowledge, goal, and cooperation mechanisms. The second one is based on sophisticated self-interested agents. Moreover, the algorithm based on fully cooperative agents, which is an adaptation of the static routing algorithm in computer networks, is constructed in order to compare its performance with performances of the team formation algorithms.",,第2页.xls
164,Effect of observer agent on ad hoc teamwork in the pursuit domain,2013,"As autonomous agents proliferate in the real world, both in software and robotic settings, they will increasingly need to band together for cooperative activities with previously unfamiliar teammates. Having autonomous agents capable of learning its previously unknown teammates' preferences and acting in harmony with them to achieve the system's end has been declared as a challenge to the AI. An agent capable of ad hoc teamwork is one that can effectively cooperate with multiple potential teammates on a set of collaborative tasks. This agent has to learn other agents' behaviours and preferences in order to be able to predict their actions on some level. This paper presents an empirical study of ad hoc teamwork, taking advantage of Observer System's merits. Specifically, we evaluate a learning mechanism for on-line behaviour generation on the part of a single ad hoc team agent that must collaborate with other unknown teammates in the pursuit domain.",,第2页.xls

166,Communication and shared knowledge in human-computer systems,1997,"When we sit in front of a VDU it is easy to focus attention on the human computer interaction. Yet when we take a picture with a modern, automatic camera or we engage in a telephone conference it is equally easy to overlook the role of information technology (and increasingly intelligent information technology) in these activities. Humans no longer interact with computers; they become part of a network of multiple interacting systems. Some of these systems will be humans, others will be intelligent software agents, while others are information processing devices and still others will be `dumb' devices. The conceptualisation of HCI as a network of interacting agents and devices has some important repercussions for design. Rather than designing systems which support existing human tasks, we are entering an era in which we develop networks of interacting systems which support domain oriented activities. The agent-device view of human computer systems emphasises that all interaction is mediated by devices. It also focuses attention of the distribution of information throughout the whole work system.",,第2页.xls
167,Establishing and maintaining long-term human-computer relationships,2005,"This research investigates the meaning of human-computer relationship and presents techniques for constructing, maintaining, and evaluating such relationships, based on research in social psychology, sociolinguistics, communication and other social sciences. Contexts in which relationships are particularly important are described, together with specific benefits (like trust) and task outcomes (like improved learning) known to be associated with relationship quality. We especially consider the problem of designing for long-term interaction, and define relational agents as computational artifacts designed to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. We construct the first such agent, and evaluate it in a controlled experiment with 101 users who were asked to interact daily with an exercise adoption system for a month. Compared to an equivalent task-oriented agent without any deliberate social-emotional or relationship-building skills, the relational agent was respected more, liked more, and trusted more, even after four weeks of interaction. Additionally, users expressed a significantly greater desire to continue working with the relational agent after the termination of the study. We conclude by discussing future directions for this research together with ethical and other ramifications of this work for HCI designers.",,第2页.xls
168,"Tasks for agent-based negotiation teams: Analysis, review, and challenges",2013,"An agent-based negotiation team is a group of interdependent agents that join together as a single negotiation party due to their shared interests in the negotiation at hand. The reasons to employ an agent-based negotiation team may vary: (i) more computation and parallelization capabilities; (ii) unite agents with different expertise and skills whose joint work makes it possible to tackle complex negotiation domains; (iii) the necessity to represent different stakeholders or different preferences in the same party (e.g., organizations, countries, and married couple). The topic of agent-based negotiation teams has been recently introduced in multi-agent research. Therefore, it is necessary to identify good practices, challenges, and related research that may help in advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based negotiation teams. For that reason, in this article we review the tasks to be carried out by agent-based negotiation teams. Each task is analyzed and related with current advances in different research areas. The analysis aims to identify special challenges that may arise due to the particularities of agent-based negotiation teams. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第2页.xls

We have been exploring a middle road through the development of tasking interfaces to enable human operators to flexibly call plays (that is, stipulate plans) at various levels, leaving the remainder to be fleshed out by a planning system.

181,Operationalized intent for communication in human-agent teams,2018,"As artificial intelligent agents are employed to increase the cognitive capability of systems leveraged by human machine teams, intra-team communication presents a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an intelligent agent for the express purpose of maintaining a computational representation of human intent for the multi-agent environment. This computational representation, referred to as operationalized intent, seeks to provide a designed shared mental model that can be leveraged by the humans and agents as a shared semantic space. Following the example of high performing human teams, the shared mental model is explicitly trained to both the human operators and the intelligent agents. The model of intent is represented by a hierarchy of goal statements and a summary of constraints. The model is extended by estimating future states of the intent model as part of planning activities. This projection of intent allows the intelligent agents to understand what is important to the human operator now and in the near future. This enhanced context could be used by intelligent agent designers to impart greater responsiveness and anticipatory behavior into a multiple intelligent agent environment, ideally without increasing the humans workload. The system level implications of enhanced context are laid out in the intent architecture pattern as an aid to system designers. Finally, operationalized intent proposes a direct evaluation method to assess the agents interpretation of the humans intent to evolve the design.",,第2页.xls

183,Reward machines for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning [arXiv],2020,"In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, a collection of agents learns to interact in a shared environment to achieve a common goal. We propose the use of reward machines (RM) -- Mealy machines used as structured representations of reward functions -- to encode the team's task. The proposed novel interpretation of RMs in the multi-agent setting explicitly encodes required teammate interdependencies and independencies, allowing the team-level task to be decomposed into sub-tasks for individual agents. We define such a notion of RM decomposition and present algorithmically verifiable conditions guaranteeing that distributed completion of the sub-tasks leads to team behavior accomplishing the original task. This framework for task decomposition provides a natural approach to decentralized learning: agents may learn to accomplish their sub-tasks while observing only their local state and abstracted representations of their teammates. We accordingly propose a decentralized q-learning algorithm. Furthermore, in the case of undiscounted rewards, we use local value functions to derive lower and upper bounds for the global value function corresponding to the team task. Experimental results in three discrete settings exemplify the effectiveness of the proposed RM decomposition approach, which converges to a successful team policy two orders of magnitude faster than a centralized learner and significantly outperforms hierarchical and independent q-learning approaches.",,第2页.xls
184,Human-agent teamwork in dynamic environments,2012,"Teamwork between humans and computer agents has become increasingly prevalent. This paper presents a behavioral study of fairness and trust in a heterogeneous setting comprising both computer agents and human participants. It investigates peoples choice of teammates and their commitment to their teams in a dynamic environment in which actions occur at a fast pace and decisions are made within tightly constrained time frames, under conditions of uncertainty and partial information. In this setting, participants could form teams by negotiating over the division of a reward for the successful completion of a group task. Participants could also choose to defect from their existing teams in order to join or create other teams. Results show that when people form teams, they offer significantly less reward to agents than they offer to people. The most significant factor affecting peoples decisions whether to defect from their existing teams is the extent to which they had successful previous interactions with other team members. Also, there is no significant difference in peoples rate of defection from agent-led teams as compared to their defection from human-led teams. These results are significant for agent designers and behavioral researchers who study human-agent interactions. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第2页.xls

186,Team problem solving and motivation under disorganization - an agent-based modeling approach,2017,"Purpose - This paper aims at simulating on how disorganization affects team problem solving. The prime objective is to determine how team problem solving varies between an organized and disorganized environment also considering motivational aspects. Design/methodology/approach - Using agent-based modeling, the authors use a real-world data set from 226 volunteers at five different types of non-profit organizations in Southwest England to define some attributes of the agents. The authors introduce the concepts of natural, structural and functional disorganization while operationalizing natural and functional disorganization. Findings - The simulations show that disorganization is more conducive for problem solving efficiency than organization given enough flexibility (range) to search and acquire resources. The findings further demonstrate that teams with resources above their hierarchical level (access to better quality resources) tend to perform better than teams that have only limited access to resources. Originality/value - The nuanced categories of (dis-)organization allow us to compare between various structural limitations, thus generating insights for improving the way managers structure teams for better problem solving.",,第2页.xls
187,An investigation into team-based planning,2004,"Models of plan formation by teams of autonomous, social agents are of interest in the application of multi-agent systems in both engineering and commerce. A team of agents may be motivated by the need to achieve a common goal, and must agree on a plan of action. However, being autonomous entities, they may differ in the contributions that they are capable of making and may have varying attitudes towards the options available (e.g. preferences over who should do what). Furthermore, in general, it is not appropriate for a team plan to be imposed by a Single manager agent. In this paper we investigate methods of collaborative plan construction and conflict resolution in teams of autonomous, social agents. We propose a multi-agent planning algorithm that interleaves planning with information exchange, coordination and negotiation, allowing the agents to handle potential conflicts, and to promote their own preferences oiler the derived solutions.",,第2页.xls
188,Attitudes Toward Risk and Effort Tradeoffs in Human-Robot Heterogeneous Team Operations,2018,"Current operational human-agent teaming paradigms place the full burden of danger on non-human agents. Shifting this burden entirely to the robot is currently possible due to the nature of the limited situations in which teleoperated robots are currently employed in military contexts. However, as the roles of non-human agents grow, robots are expected to function as teammates rather than tools. Here, we present a theoretical framework and metric for quantifying commanders attitudes toward risk and effort for humans and robots under their command. Twenty-one participants tasked a Soldier, a robot, and a heterogeneous team to rescue civilians in dangerous environments. Participants were risk averse when tasking each agent individually, but exhibited a risk averse attitude for the Soldier and an effort averse attitude for the robot when tasking the team. These findings show that risk attitudes can change as a function of team composition. The framework developed herein has utility for studying tradeoff attitudes across a wide breadth of contexts.",,第2页.xls
189,Evolution of shared grammars for describing simulated spatial scenes with grammatical evolution,2018,"We propose a model based on an evolutionary process combined with an adapted planning process to develop a limited spatial language with a syntactical structure in a team of artificial agents. Syntax is induced by means of a grammar and the grammar itself evolves in order to reach a syntactical agreement in the team. Evolution is implemented by adapting an evolutionary algorithm where each agent in the team manages a population of chromosomes that represent possible grammars. Grammars can be used by agents to generate utterances which are subsequently applied in language games to describe spatial relations. A planning process builds the sentences, but agents select the syntactical alternatives according to their current communicative intentions. Results in two different linguistic task show how a shared grammar can be developed in the group of agents.",,第2页.xls

191,Situation awareness-based agent transparency and human-autonomy teaming effectiveness,2018,"Effective collaboration between humans and agents depends on humans maintaining an appropriate understanding of and calibrated trust in the judgment of their agent counterparts. TheSituation Awareness-based Agent Transparency(SAT) model was proposed to support human awareness in human-agent teams. As agents transition from tools to artificial teammates, an expansion of the model is necessary to support teamwork paradigms, which require bidirectional transparency. We propose that an updated model can better inform human-agent interaction in paradigms involving more advanced agent teammates. This paper describes the model's use in three programmes of research, which exemplify the utility of the model in different contexts - an autonomous squad member, a mediator between a human and multiple subordinate robots, and a plan recommendation agent. Through this review, we show that the SAT model continues to be an effective tool for facilitating shared understanding and proper calibration of trust in human-agent teams.",,第2页.xls
192,Multiparty Interactions for Coordination in a Mixed Human-Agent Teamwork,2017,"Virtual environments for human learning enable one or more users to interact with virtual agents in order to perform their tasks. This collaboration necessitates that the members of the team share a set of beliefs and reason about resources, plans and actions to be implemented. This article introduces a new multiparty coordination model allowing several virtual and human agents to dialogue and reason about the tasks that the user must learn. The proposed model relies on a shared plan based approach to represent the beliefs of the team members. The management of the multiparty aspect makes it possible to differentiate the behaviors to be produced according to the type of receiver of a communication: recipient or listener. Finally, in the context of learning a procedural activity, a study examines the effect of our multiparty model on a learner. Results show that the use of proactive pedagogical agents with multiparty competencies boosts the construction of common beliefs.",,第2页.xls
193,Situation recognition for reactive agent behavior,2006,Situation recognition in RoboCup gets more and more important to enhance team behavior strategies. In this paper we present an approach for a cooperative situation recognition architecture which directly influences the game strategy of the own team. The presented situation recognition architecture is derived from the human archetype to recognize situations by a combination of learned knowledge and observation of the environment. Humans only consider a limited number of situation interpretations for certain environmental scenes. We transfer that concept and introduce situation libraries as an analogous approach for computer systems. Consequently for every recognized situation a cooperative team behavior is defined. This will effectively enhance the team play and the ability of a team to adapt its behavior to the strategies of an opponent and to the current game state.,,第2页.xls

195,Multimodal Design for Interactive Collaborative Problem-Solving Support,2024,"When analyzing interactions during collaborative problem solving (CPS) tasks, many different communication modalities are likely to be present and interpretable. These modalities may include speech, gesture, action, affect, pose and object position in physical space, amongst others. As AI becomes more prominent in day-to-day use and various learning environments, such as classrooms, there is potential for it to support additional understanding into how small groups work together to complete CPS tasks. Designing interactive AI to support CPS requires creating a system that supports multiple different modalities. In this paper we discuss the importance of multimodal features to modeling CPS, how different modal channels must interact in a multimodal AI agent that supports a wide range of tasks, and design considerations that require forethought when building such a system that most effectively interacts with and aids small groups in successfully completing CPS tasks. We also outline various tool sets that can be leveraged to support each of the individual features and their integration, and various applications for such a system.",,第2页.xls

Such agents that teach languages differ significantly from their general-purpose counterparts in their goals, their approach, and their users' characteristics, thereby effectively creating a new interaction paradigm for which little literature exists in the HCI of Conversational Interfaces community. The difference from general-purpose agents comes from two themes highlighted in this work: the user is not expected to know the language of interaction, and the purpose of the conversation is language education through task completion rather than task completion itself. This paper highlights the role and the research challenges of interactions with dialogue agents that allow people to learn and practice new languages.",,第2页.xls

The behaviors that student show while solving a task in a computer-supported collaborative environment, that is, the roles they play, are vital to reach teaching and learning goals successfully. In this context, we present a multi-agent model that monitors students participation in a group, recognizes their team roles as they work collaboratively, automatically builds their profiles, diagnoses the state of the collaboration considering balance of team roles as an ideal situation, and proposes corrective actions when the group behavior is far from this ideal.

Generally, an A-Team assumes that a collection of software agents, each representing a particular problem solving method, cooperate to solve a problem by dynamically evolving a population of solutions. In the suggested implementation each software agent carries out a guided local search.

204,Using Perceptual and Cognitive Explanations for Enhanced Human-Agent Team Performance,2018,"Most explainable AI (XAI) research projects focus on well-delineated topics, such as interpretability of machine learning outcomes, knowledge sharing in a multi-agent system or human trust in agent's performance. For the development of explanations in human-agent teams, a more integrative approach is needed. This paper proposes a perceptual-cognitive explanation (PeCoX) framework for the development of explanations that address both the perceptual and cognitive foundations of an agent's behavior, distinguishing between explanation generation, communication and reception. It is a generic framework (i.e., the core is domain-agnostic and the perceptual layer is model-agnostic), and being developed and tested in the domains of transport, health-care and defense. The perceptual level entails the provision of an Intuitive Confidence Measure and the identification of the foil in a contrastive explanation. The cognitive level entails the selection of the beliefs, goals and emotions for explanations. Ontology Design Patterns are being constructed for the reasoning and communication, whereas Interaction Design Patterns are being constructed for the shaping of the multimodal communication. First results show (1) positive effects on human's understanding of the perceptual and cognitive foundation of agent's behavior, and (2) the need for harmonizing the explanations to the context and human's information processing capabilities.",,第2页.xls

211,Bidirectional Communication for Effective Human-Agent Teaming,2018,"The recent proliferation of artificial intelligence research is reaching a point where machines are able to learn and adapt to dynamically make decisions independently or in collaboration with human team members. With such technological advancements on the horizon, there will come a mandate to develop techniques to deploy effective human-agent teams. One key challenge to the development of effective teaming has been enabling a shared, dynamic understanding of mission space, and a basic knowledge about the states and intents other team-mates. Bidirectional communication is an approach that fosters communication between human and intelligent agents to improve mutual understanding and enable effective task coordination. This session focuses on current research and scientific gaps in three areas necessary to advance the field of bidirectional communication between human and intelligent agent team members. First, intelligent agents must be capable of understanding the state and intent of the human team member. Second, human team members must be capable of understanding the capabilities and intent of the intelligent agent. Finally, in order for the entire system to work, systems must effectively integrate information from and coordinate behaviors across all team members. The combination of these three areas will enable future human-agent teams to develop a shared understanding of the environment as well as a mutual understanding of each other, thereby enabling truly collaborative human-agent teams.",,第2页.xls

216,LLexus: an AI agent system for incident management,2024,"When operating a software service on a cloud, the complexity of keeping multiple distributed components responsive is a significant challenge for engineering teams. Engineers frequently rely on Troubleshooting Guides (TSGs) to navigate how to mitigate performance or outage incidents. However, the effectiveness of TSGs is often hindered by their length, implicit reliance on tribal knowledge, and the variable quality of their content. This paper introduces LLExus, an agent-based AI system to automate the execution of TSGs. LLExus employs Large Language Model (LLM) agents to transform TSGs into precise, executable plans during a planning phase. Those plans are then executed when an incident occurs. LLExus primarily comprises of an interactive planner and an executor. The planner aids engineers in refining TSGs into detailed plans represented as flowcharts, delineating tasks and decision points. The executor then autonomously carries out these plans, requiring human assistance only for tasks that require physical actions such as replacing equipment. Through a series of use cases, we demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of LLExus, showcasing its potential to streamline the incident management process. Our key findings highlight LLExus's ability to improve the readability of TSGs. The system's use of LLMs in the planning phase ensures a reduction in both LLM-related costs and the impact of potential errors in execution.",,第2页.xls
217,Adversarial Search and Tracking with Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Sparsely Observable Environment,2023,"We study a search and tracking (S&T) problem where a team of dynamic search agents must collaborate to track an adversarial, evasive agent. The heterogeneous search team may only have access to a limited number of past adversary trajectories within a large search space. This problem is challenging for both model-based searching and reinforcement learning (RL) methods since the adversary exhibits reactionary and deceptive evasive behaviors in a large space leading to sparse detections for the search agents. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework that leverages the estimated adversary location from our learnable filtering model. We show that our MARL architecture can outperform all baselines and achieves a 46% increase in detection rate.",,第2页.xls

219,Monitoring deployed agent teams,2001,"Recent years are seeing an increasing need for on-line monitoring of deployed distributed teams of cooperating agents, e.g., for visualization, or performance tracking. However, in deployed systems, we often cannot rely on the agents to communicate their state to the monitoring system: (a) we rarely can change the behavior of already-deployed agents to communicate the required information (e.g., in legacy or proprietary systems); (b) different monitoring goals require different information to be communicated (e.g., agents' beliefs vs. plans); and (c) communications may be expensive, unreliable, or insecure. This paper presents a non-intrusive approach based on plan-recognition, in which the monitored agents' state is inferred from observations of their routine actions. In particular, we focus on inference of the team state based on its observed routine communications, exchanged as part of coordinated task execution. The paper includes the following key novel contributions: (i) a linear time probabilistic plan-recognition algorithm, well-suited for processing communications as observations; (ii) an approach to exploiting general knowledge of teamwork to predict agent responses during normal execution, to reduce monitoring uncertainty; and (iii) a monitoring algorithm that trades expressivity for scalability, representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses, but allowing for any number of agents and their different activities, to be represented in a single coherent entity. Our empirical evaluation illustrates that monitoring based on observed routine communications enables significant monitoring accuracy, while not being intrusive. The results also demonstrate a key lesson: A combination of complementary low-quality techniques is cheaper, and better, than a single, highly-optimized monitoring approach.",,第2页.xls

Hundreds of applications that were hosted on physical hardware were migrated to the cloud onto internally supported Kubernetes environments. This established a microservice architecture for many applications at Ancestry. In 2020, Ancestry's cloud expenses goals were set at $12M in Operating expenses savings over 2 years. To overcome the problem of scale, an automated right-sizing effort needed to take place. Ancestry purchased a tool called Opsani. Opsani allowed the team to use dynamic canary testing in combination with a CanaryAdvisor to act as the AI agent. Opsani was integrated into Ancestry's continuous integration and continuous delivery platform to automate right-sizing and help reach cost optimization targets with limited resources. After a successful proof of concept was developed by the DNA Matches agile team, there was a company-wide integration of Opsani into Ancestry's CI/CD platform. The tool would need to scale out continuous optimization efforts across many of the teams utilizing Kubernetes and virtual machine infrastructure. This case study details the experience and knowledge gained from scaling automation optimizations using an AI agent with more than 200 individual applications across 30 agile teams. The challenges introduced by the rate of changes in the system and monitoring feedback delays began to affect the customer experience with the product. As teams adopted optimization changes at higher rates, new guard rails were introduced to control the release cycles and ensure stability for paying customers.",,第2页.xls
222,"Discrete Multi-agent Plan Recognition: Recognizing Teams, Goals, and Plans from Action Sequences",2017,"Multi-agent Plan Recognition (MPAR) infers teams and their goals from observed actions of individual agents. The complexity of creating a priori plan libraries significantly increases to account for diversity of action sequences different team structures may exhibit. A key challenge in MPAR is effectively pruning the joint search space of agent to team compositions and goal to team assignments. Here, we describe discrete Multi-agent Plan Recognition as Planning (MAPRAP), which extends Ramirez and Geffner's Plan Recognition as Planning (PRAP) approach to multi-agent domains. Instead of a plan library, MAPRAP uses the planning domain and synthesizes plans to achieve hypothesized goals with additional constraints for suspected team composition and previous observations. By comparing costs of plans, MAPRAP identifies feasible interpretations that explain the teams and plans observed. We establish a performance profile for discrete MAPRAP in a multi-agent blocks-world domain. We evaluated precision, accuracy, and recall after each observation. We compare two pruning strategies to dampen the explosion of hypotheses tested. Aggressive pruning averages 1.05 plans synthesized per goal per time step for multi-agent scenarios vice 0.56 for single agent scenarios.",,第2页.xls

224,Exploring the role of judgement and shared situation awareness when working with AI recommender systems,2024,"AI-advised Decision Making is a form of human-autonomy teaming in which an AI recommender system suggests a solution to a human operator, who is responsible for the final decision. This work seeks to examine the importance of judgement and shared situation awareness between humans and automated agents when interacting together in the form of a recommender systems. We propose manipulating both human judgement and shared situation awareness by providing the human decision maker with relevant information that the automated agent (AI), in the form of a recommender system, uses to generate possible courses of action. This paper presents the results of a two-phase between-subjects study in which participants and a recommender system jointly make a high-stakes decision. We varied the amount of relevant information the participant had, the assessment technique of the proposed solution, and the reliability of the recommender system. Findings indicate that this technique of supporting the human's judgement and establishing a shared situation awareness is effective in (1) boosting the human decision maker's situation awareness and task performance, (2) calibrating their trust in AI teammates, and (3) reducing overreliance on an AI partner. Additionally, participants were able to pinpoint the limitations and boundaries of the AI partner's capabilities. They were able to discern situations where the AI's recommendations could be trusted versus instances when they should not rely on the AI's advice. This work proposes and validates a way to provide model-agnostic transparency into recommender systems that can support the human decision maker and lead to improved team performance.",,第2页.xls
225,Understanding Underground Incentivized Review Services,2024,"While human factors in fraud have been studied by the HCI and security communities, most research has been directed to understanding either the victims' perspectives or prevention strategies, and not on fraudsters, their motivations and operation techniques. Additionally, the focus has been on a narrow set of problems: phishing, spam and bullying. In this work, we seek to understand review fraud on e-commerce platforms through an HCI lens. Through surveys with real fraudsters (N=36 agents and N=38 reviewers), we uncover sophisticated recruitment, execution, and reporting mechanisms fraudsters use to scale their operation while resisting takedown attempts, including the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. We fnd that countermeasures that crack down on communication channels through which these services operate are efective in combating incentivized reviews. This research sheds light on the complex landscape of incentivized reviews, providing insights into the mechanics of underground services and their resilience to removal eforts.",,第2页.xls
226,Plan sharing: showcasing coordinated UAV formation flight,2006,"Agent teaming and autonomy are foundational themes in multi-agent systems. Agents may work as singletons or they may work in environments where other agents exist. In multi-agent systems, agents may form teams by sharing common goals with other agents. Cooperation is essential for any collaborative, group activity. Beyond coordination and judicious role assignment, cooperation enables members of a team to be aware and account for collection of their goals as well as the performance of agents on individual goals. This paper presents a general model of cooperation and illustrates how it may enhance group performance. In this paper, we present results of an application of the concept of cooperation in a simulated swarm of reconnaissance urban UAVs that are tracking vehicles in an urban environment.",,第2页.xls
227,"MechAgents: Large language model multi-agent collaborations can solve mechanics problems, generate new data, and integrate knowledge",2024,"Solving mechanics problems using numerical methods requires comprehensive intelligent capability of retrieving relevant knowledge and theory, constructing and executing codes, analyzing the results, a task that has thus far mainly been reserved for humans. While emerging AI methods can provide effective approaches to solve end-toend problems, for instance via the use of deep surrogate models or various data analytics strategies, they often lack physical intuition since knowledge is baked into the parametric complement through training, offering less flexibility when it comes to incorporating mathematical or physical insights. By leveraging diverse capabilities of multiple dynamically interacting large language models (LLMs), we can overcome the limitations of conventional approaches and develop a new class of physics-inspired generative machine learning platform, here referred to as MechAgents. A set of AI agents can solve mechanics tasks, here demonstrated for elasticity problems, via autonomous collaborations. A two-agent team can effectively write, execute and self-correct code, in order to apply finite element methods to solve classical elasticity problems in various flavors (different boundary conditions, domain geometries, meshes, small/finite deformation and linear/hyper-elastic constitutive laws, and others). For more complex tasks, we construct a larger group of agents with enhanced division of labor among planning, formulating, coding, executing and criticizing the process and results. The agents mutually correct each other to improve the overall team-work performance in understanding, formulating and validating the solution. Our framework shows the potential of synergizing the intelligence of language models, the reliability of physicsbased modeling, and the dynamic collaborations among diverse agents, opening novel avenues for automation of solving engineering problems.",,第2页.xls
228,Negotiated search: organizing cooperative search among heterogeneous expert agents,1992,"We present negotiated search, a paradigm for cooperative search and conflict resolution among loosely-coupled expert agents. The paradigm is realized in TEAM, a framework that provides a flexible environment for agent integration. TEAM enables agents with heterogeneous characteristics and capabilities to work together cooperatively. Experimental results from a design application program implemented in TEAM are presented. These results indicate that system performance is correlated with the organization of the agent set based on the ability of agents to communicate, the interaction capabilities instantiated at each agent, and by the texture of agents' local solution spaces. The experiments show that heterogeneous agents can work together without tightly coordinated organization. However, they also demonstrate that some agent organizations have more potential for effective cooperation than others. We analyze agent characteristics that affect this potential and discuss the use of negotiated-search strategies that take advantage of the particular strengths of the agents in an agent set. Both agent characteristics and group dynamics have far-reaching implications for the development of multi-agent systems and for the design of agents that are intended to work within agent sets.",,第2页.xls
229,A Cooperation Strategy of Multi-agents in Real-Time Dynamic Environments,2006,"Games such as sports, RTS, RPG, which teams of players play, require advanced artificial intelligence technology for team management. The existing artificial intelligence enables an intelligent agent to have the autonomy solving problem by itself, but to lack interaction and cooperation between agents. This paper presents Level Unified Approach Method with effective role allocation and autonomy in multi-agent system. This method allots sub-goals to agents using role information to accomplish a global goal. Each agent makes a decision and takes actions by itself in dynamic environments. Global goal of Team coordinates to allocated role in tactics approach. Each agent leads interactive cooperation by sharing state information with another using Databoard. As each agent has planning capacity, an agent takes appropriate actions for playing allocated roles in dynamic environments. This cooperation and interactive operation between agents causes a collision problem, so it approaches at tactics side for controlling this problem. Our experimental result shows that Level Unified Approach Method has better performance than existing central approach method or de-centralized approach method",,第2页.xls

231,The Development of an Agent-Based Modeling Framework for Simulating Engineering Team Work,2012,"Team working is becoming increasingly important in modern organizations due to its beneficial outcomes. A team's performance levels are determined by complex interactions between the attributes of its individual members, the communication and dynamics between members, the working environment, and the team's work tasks. As organizations evolve, so too does the nature of team working. During the past two decades, product development in engineering organizations has increasingly been undertaken by multidisciplinary integrated product teams. Such increasing complexity means that the nature of research methods for studying teams must also evolve. Accordingly, this paper proposes an agent-based modeling approach for simulating team working within an engineering environment, informed by research conducted in two engineering organizations. The model includes a number of variables at an individual level (competency, motivation, availability, response rate), team level (communication, shared mental models, trust), and task level (difficulty, workflow), which jointly determine team performance (quality, time to complete the task, time spent working on the task). In addition to describing the model's development, the paper also reports the results of various simulation runs that were conducted in response to realistic team working scenarios, together with its validation. Finally, the paper discusses the model's practical applications as a tool for facilitating organizational decision making with respect to optimizing team working.",,第2页.xls
232,ESCAP: Towards the Design of an AI Architecture for a Virtual Counselor to Tackle Students' Exam Stress,2012,"Exam stress is a common predicament faced by students of all age groups and cultures. Unfortunately, it has neither created much consternation in the society nor attracted much interest for serious research, perhaps due to its impulsive causal nature that disappears almost instantly after the exams are over. Stress in optimal level can stimulate students to achieve their personal best in their exams. However, one of the greatest threats to the well-being of students arises due to the fallout of excessive stress, which, if not addressed timely may not only lead to failure in exams, but result in serious debilitating consequences including insomnia, depression and even suicide. Our research aims to design a human computer interaction (HCI) interface using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for modeling a virtual exam-stress counsellor ESCAP, an embodied conversational agent with facial animation, advice and intelligence of a professional psychologist to support undergraduate students in managing their exam stress.",,第2页.xls
233,The multi-team formation precursor of teamwork,2005,"We formulate the multi-team formation (M-TF) domain-independent problem and describe a generic solution for the problem. We illustrate the M-TF preference relation component in the domain of a large-scale disaster response simulation environment. The M-TF problem is the precursor of teamwork that explicitly addresses the achievement of several short time period goals, where the work to achieve the complete set of goals overwhelms the working capacity of the team formation space (all teams formed from the finite set of available agents). Decisions regarding team formation are made by the agents considering their own probabilistic beliefs and utility preferences about the whole (known) set of goals to achieve. The RoboCupRescue simulated large-scale disaster domain is used to illustrate the design of the preference relation domain-specific M-TF component.",,第2页.xls
234,Modeling the influence of trust on work team performance,2012,"The selection of suitable people to make up a successful work team is not a trivial decision-making process, because of the diversity and complexity of the factors that influence individual and team performance. Teams are assembled by project managers using their experience and the information they have available (although this is frequently scarce, uncertain, and dynamic) about the personal and professional characteristics of potential team members. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based model developed to support this decision-making process where a virtual team can be configured using some selected characteristics of potential team members. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules are used to model the interaction between team members and a given set of tasks, generating statistical information that represents possible performance by team members. More specifically, the paper focuses on the concept of trust, an important social skill that influences performance at individual (team member) and global (work team) levels. We describe the implementation of an agent-based simulation system where the user can test different team configurations to compare performance and select the best possible work team for a given project. The evaluation and validation of the model was performed through face validity and historical data validation techniques, which are based on information collected from real work teams. The results show the suitability of the model as a helpful tool in the formation and configuration of work teams for specific scenarios.",,第2页.xls
235,A Conceptual Agent Cooperation Model for Multi-agent Systems' Team Formation Process,2008,"Agent cooperation is the key advantageous feature of agent-oriented software (AOS) in comparison with all other software approaches. Agent cooperation process has the potential to dynamically form a team of agents, and then execute a plan to achieve a common goal. Applying the agent cooperation concept requires two software engineering tools: the first is the software development methodology that can design the cooperative agent-based system; the second is the agent cooperation model that can manage the team behaviour at runtime.This on-going research attempts to engineer the agent cooperation concept into two steps: the first step, the Prometheus development methodology is enhanced to acquire the capabilities to generate the agent team artefacts that will be consumed by the proposed cooperation model; in the second step, a conceptual cooperation model is developed. In regard to the complexity of agent cooperation process, the implementation part of the cooperation model held for further investigated.",,第2页.xls
236,Informed Diversity Search for Learning in Asymmetric Multiagent Systems,2024,"To coordinate in multiagent settings, asymmetric agents (agents with distinct objectives and capabilities) must learn diverse behaviors that allow them to maximize their individual and team objectives. Hierarchical learning techniques partially address this by leveraging a combination of Quality-Diversity to learn diverse agent-specific behaviors and evolutionary optimization to maximize team objectives. However, isolating diversity search from team optimization is prone to producing egocentric behaviors that have misaligned objectives. This work introduces Diversity Aligned Island Model (DA-IM), a coevolutionary framework that fluidly adapts diversity search to focus on behaviors that yield high fitness teams. An evolutionary algorithm evolves a population of teams to optimize the team objective. Concurrently, a combination of gradient-based optimizers utilize experiences collected by the teams to reinforce agent-specific behaviors and selectively mutate them based on their fitness on the team objective. Periodically, the mutated policies are added to the evolutionary population to inject diversity and to ensure alignment between the two processes. Empirical evaluations on two asymmetric coordination problems with varying degrees of alignment highlight DA-IM's ability to produce diverse behaviors that outperform existing population-based diversity search methods.",,第2页.xls

240,Information needs in agent teamwork,2004,"Members of effective human teams can often anticipate information needs of teammates and offer relevant information to them proactively. Such capabilities are highly desirable for agent teams to achieve better teamwork processes for supporting information gathering, information fusion, and decision makings of teammates. However, there is a lack of agent theories for specifying such proactive agent behavior. The starting point of establishing such a theory is to formally characterize the concept of information-need and provide a framework for reasoning about others' information-needs. To this end, in this paper we (1) introduce a modal operator to represent agents' information-needs; (2) investigate levels of information-needs using the idea of precondition-tree; (3) identify several types of information-needs prevalent in agent teamwork; (4) provide and justify the axioms for anticipating others' information-needs; and (5) to complete the framework, introduce an axiom for enabling agents to commit to helping others with their information-needs. This paper thus provides a formal basis for developing agent theories about proactive information delivery behavior.",,第2页.xls

The RoboCup research initiative, particularly the simulation league, has been proposed to pursue such multi-agent research challenges, using the common testbed of simulation soccer. Despite the significant popularity of RoboCup within the research community, general lessons have not often been extracted from participation in RoboCup. This is what we attempt to do here. We have fielded two teams, ISIS97 and ISIS98, in RoboCup competitions. These teams have been in the top four teams in these competitions.

Using stepwise multiple linear regression, it was found that workload (NASA-TLX), gender, education level, and the reliability of the autonomous agent impact the perceived reliability or user trust in the system. When the user experienced higher workload, the user placed less trust in the autonomous agent. Females trusted the agent less and more educated users trusted the autonomous agent more.

245,Dialogue in team formation,2000,"The process of cooperative problem solving can be divided into four stages. First, finding potential team members, then forming a team followed by constructing a plan for that team. Finally, the plan is executed by the team. Traditionally, very simple protocols like the Contract Net protocol are used for performing the first two stages of the process. And often the team is already taken for granted. In an open environment (like in e.g. electronic commerce) however, there can be discussion among the agents in order to form a team that can achieve the collective goal of solving the problem. For these cases fixed protocols like contract net do not suffice. In this paper we present an alternative solution, using structured dialogues that can be shown to lead to the required team formation. The dialogues are described formally (using some modal logics), thus making it possible to actually prove that a certain dialogue has a specific outcome.",,第2页.xls

We update the model and add a genetic algorithm in order to investigate the effects of differing initial ideas within teams of different personality combinations as they attempt to collaborate to achieve their shared task. We run experiments on homogeneous teams with similar personalities and heterogeneous teams with random personalities and find that increased diversity in team members' initial ideas significantly improves teamwork, and more so for teams comprising individuals with similar personalities.",,第2页.xls

248,Automating the Enterprise with Foundation Models,2024,"Automating enterprise workflows could unlock $4 trillion/year in productivity gains. Despite being of interest to the data management community for decades, the ultimate vision of end-to-end workflow automation has remained elusive. Current solutions rely on process mining and robotic process automation (RPA), in which a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of predefined rules for completing a workflow. Through case studies of a hospital and large B2B enterprise, we find that the adoption of RPA has been inhibited by high set-up costs (12-18 months), unreliable execution (60% initial accuracy), and burdensome maintenance (requiring multiple FTEs). Multimodal foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 offer a promising new approach for end-to-end workflow automation given their generalized reasoning and planning abilities. To study these capabilities we propose ECLAIR, a system to automate enterprise workflows with minimal human supervision. We conduct initial experiments showing that multimodal FMs can address the limitations of traditional RPA with (1) near-human-level understanding of workflows (93% accuracy on a workflow understanding task) and (2) instant set-up with minimal technical barrier (based solely on a natural language description of a workflow, ECLAIR achieves end-to-end completion rates of 40%). We identify human-AI collaboration, validation, and self-improvement as open challenges, and suggest ways they can be solved with data management techniques.

252,Multi-limited simple eco-grammar systems with prescribed teams,2009,"In each derivation step of a simple eco-grammar system with prescribed teams of ter Beek [2], at most one production of every agent of a team is used. In [15], we have softened this restriction imposed upon the agents. Each agent may use a greater, but limited number of productions in every step. We have considered two different kinds of such limited eco-grammar systems with prescribed teams where the corresponding actions of the agents are motivated by the limitations of k-limited [11] or uniformly k-limited [12, 17] 0L systems, respectively. All agents of a fixed system use the same limitation. In this paper, we broaden the definitions of the systems in such a manner that the agents of a system may use different limitations. By this means, the generative power of the systems is enlarged. The corresponding language families are compared with each other according to the different types of the underlying L systems (0L, T0L, etc.), according to the different limitations and different sets of agents of the underlying (uniformly) k-limited 0L systems, and they are also compared with the language families given by 0L or (uniformly) k-limited 0L systems.",,第2页.xls

Temporal aspects of the model are rooted in the system theory of time. This theoretical background provides for obtaining properties of time coordination. In particular, it is proved that some theoretically advanced models for computation and visualization cannot be realized by physical devices.

255,Playmaker: Graphical Definition of Formations and Setplays,2010,"The fall of chess as a main domain for Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, after the victory of Deep Blue over Kasparov, put forward robotic soccer as a new challenging domain for AI researchers. Robotic Soccer is very appropriate for researching in Distributed AI problems, e.g. coordination methodologies, whose results can later be applied to other domains. Coordination can be defined as the capability of several agents to work together as a team, in order to accomplish a common goal. In the context of robotic soccer, several aspects may benefit from appropriate coordination methodologies, since team play is decisive for winning the games. This paper presents a methodology to enable a team of robotic soccer agents to coordinate their positioning in the field, and a methodology that enables them to cooperatively execute predefined set plays (flexible plans). Both coordination methods are used in real soccer and sports in general, commonly known as formations and set plays respectively. However, its use in a team of autonomous agents is still unexplored and is a major innovation of this work. A graphical tool to define formations and set plays was fully developed in the context of this work offering a quicker and more appealing way to define both formations and set plays. The tool's interface was inspired on blackboard applications, used nowadays for the same purpose in real sports. The tool enables very easy definition of set plays that may then be executed in real-time during the matches. Examples of complete set plays and their practical execution are also described, showing the usefulness of the set play concept and the utility of the developed tool.",,第2页.xls

258,An Architecture Of Intelligent Multi-Agent System: A Case Study In Soccer Game Simulation,2010,"Multi-agent collaboration or teamwork and learning are critical research challenges especially for a large number of multi-agent applications. In multi-agent system, agents must accurately perceive and act, despite a quickly changing and noisy environment. They have to act not only at individual skills but also at collaborative and adversarial behaviours. Soccer team simulations are used to provide a suitable test bed for research in multi-agent collaboration systems. In this paper, we proposed agent architecture for soccer team simulation. It is an agent architecture within which a flexible team organization and decision-making are presented. The proposed agent architecture includes four main components. First, the world model that describes the environment, which provides a very important resource for making decisions. The world model information is collected through environment monitoring and world prediction for the unobserved information. The second component is team organization, which is achieved by means of Team Agreement. The third one is an inter-agent communication paradigm that enables team coordination and knowledge transfer between agents. The fourth is a decision-making process, which includes passing policy, shoots policy, and strategic position policy. In the decision-making process, we proposed and implemented heuristic passing algorithm, neural-network-based shooting algorithm, and heuristic strategic position algorithm. Experimental results of the proposed system prove its stability and applicability.

We show that communication has a non-monotonic effect: while initial increases in communication strength result in better performance, when one exceeds an optimal degree, performance declines up to a point in which independent agents perform better than agents communicating in teams. We show that this is largely due to the fact that too much communication confuses agents, blocking the process of sorting alternatives out. Similar considerations on non-monotonicity still holds if we substitute independent choice under communication with group choice based on voting. However, the latter rule, compared to the former one, shows lower performance for all communication strengths.",,第2页.xls
263,On the use of human instruction for improving the behavior of RoboCup soccer agents,2011,"In this article, we propose a behavior generation approach with human instruction to improve the strategy of the RoboCup soccer 3D simulation team. Many teams implement their strategies based on the programmer's own knowledge about soccer. That is, the programmers have to write action rules that cover any situation on the soccer field. Although it is clear that this is not the best approach, there are only a few researchers who have tackled this problem. Here, we solve the problem using human instruction to improve the manually implemented behavior of soccer robots. It is shown that the team performance is improved by the rules generated by this approach.",,第2页.xls

This paper particularly focuses on robust recognition through information fusions issue among numbers of others issues that are equally important. The robust recognition through information fusion is selected because it is one of the most universal issues in AI and robotics, and particularly interesting for domains such as soccer and rescue that has high degree of dynamics and uncertainty, as well as being resource bounded.

265,Enhancing Group Cohesion in Virtual Communities of Practice,2011,"This paper describes software agents that monitor the formation of teams within the System-Oriented UAV simulator SOUL. Operators must be trained in virtual teams, working in communities of practice. According to the evaluation of their collective skills, users can then be placed in communities of competencies. For monitoring the interactions between operators, an agent framework facilitates the collaborative training, by pushing up contracts and aiding cohesion of human-teams. The contracts make the most with the direct use of e-portfolio for operators to gather the social dependencies on knowledge and skills. This allows us to assess operator's actions in real time together with an immediate detection and analysis of misbehavior feedbacks, improving the whole situation awareness.",,第2页.xls

267,Task difficulty and team diversity on team creativity: Multi-agent simulation approach,2015,"Organizational structures are complex and vary according to sector, field, and type of business or service. In order to be effective, an organization needs to tailor its activities to the environment in which is it located. Based on contingency perspectives, this study is focused on investigating effective ways to design team diversity and maximize team creativity according to task difficulty levels. Considering the organizational team member as an agent, the study employed a multi-agent simulation method to understand the progress of creative manifestation, by observing the exploration and exploitation activity of team members over certain periods of time. The results first reveal that the level of team diversity influences the amount of creativity manifested by team members activities, such as exploration and exploitation. Second, managers have to properly facilitate either exploration or exploitation depending on task difficulty by striking a balance between them. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第2页.xls
268,Smart RogAgent: Where Agents and Humans Team Up,2019,"The increasing diffusion of team building as a means to enhance social relations and define roles within teams, and the cost of setting up a real team building event, raises the pressing need of simulating team building activities in order to assess the effectiveness of different formats, run in different contexts and under different conditions, before one is selected for a particular scenario.The selection of a software platform employing software abstractions which are close to the real entities involved in a team building event, including human beings and their roles, goals, and organisations, paves the way to substituting some simulated entity with its real counterpart, moving from simulation to a hybrid application where real entities and their software alter egos can co-exist.We present the design of Smart RogAgent, a JaCaMo multi-agent system aimed at simulating rogaining, a special kind of team building activity. Once fully developed, Smart RogAgent will have the potential to allow artificial intelligent agents to enter human teams, and vice versa, providing the technological support for the creation of hybrid humanagent teams in a principled way.",,第2页.xls
269,Towards flexible teamwork in persistent teams,1998,"Teamwork is a critical capability in multi-agent environments. Many such environments mandate that the agents and agent-teams must be persistent i.e., exist over long periods of time. Agents in such persistent teams are bound together by their long-term common interests and goals.This paper focuses on flexible teamwork an such persistent teams. Unfortunately, while previous work has investigated flexible teamwork, persistent teams remain unexplored. For flexible teamwork, one promising approach that has emerged is model-based, i.e., providing agent's with general models of teamwork that explicitly specify their commitments an teamwork. Such models Enable agents to autonomously reason about coordination. Unfortunately, for persistent teams, such models may lead to coordination and communication actions that while locally optimal, are highly problematic for the team's long-term goals. We present a decision-theoretic technique to enable persistent teams to overcome such limitations of the model-based approach. In particular, agents reason about expected team utilities of future team states that are projected to result from actions recommended by the teamwork model, as well as lower-cost (or higher-cost) variations on these actions. To accomodate real-time constraints, this reasoning is done in an any-time fashion. Implemented examples from an analytic search tree and some real-world domains are presented.",,第2页.xls
270,Pragmatic Software Maintainability Management Using a Multi-agent System Working in Collaboration with the Development Team,2021,"This paper introduces an ongoing PhD work that focuses on the design of a multi-agent system that would assess software maintainability in collaboration with human developers. Evaluation of the maintainability is difficult to implement on actual industrial projects as specific criteria cannot be easily adapted to the context of a project, and metrics are not always relevant to the architectural pattern in use. The metrics can be bypassed without improving the quality of the source code. We have the ambition to tackle this problem through a more modular, flexible and dynamic assessment system that will ultimately evolve through a dialogic interaction with the development team. Our approach will first lay the foundations of a shared vocabulary between the artificial agents and the human team. We will further develop a multi-agent system first by introducing feedback from the human team and second by moving towards a real dialogic interaction.",,第2页.xls
271,An efficient information sharing approach for large scale multi-agent team,2008,"Effective communication among agents in large teams is crucial because the members share a common goal but only have a partial views of the environment. Information sharing is difficult in a large team because, a team member may have a piece of valuable information but not know who needs the information, since it is infeasible to know what each other agent is doing. Although much related work has been done on efficient delivery of information, most work is based on assumptions which are not suited to large scale multiagent teams. In this paper, we made two contributions. Firstly, we present a solution to sharing information that is applicable to large teams based on previous research. A key to the solution is imposing a static network topology on the members of the team where each agent requiring communication to be only along very few links in that network. The key observation underlying this solution is that each piece of information is interrelated and the sender of a piece of information can guess who might need some information based on previously sent messages. Thus, when an agent has a piece of information, it can determine which of its neighbors in the network is most likely to either need the information or know who does, based on related messages previously received. Secondly, we investigate the influence of different types of team network topology on the efficiency of information sharing. Our results show that our algorithm works with various topologies but gets the best performance on a scale free network.",,第2页.xls

273,A New Model for Team Optimization: The Effects of Uncertainty on Interaction,2008,"The objective of this paper is twofold. First, a new model of team optimization is formulated. Second, this model is used to investigate the effects of uncertainty on interaction. A model of team optimization that encompasses the classical team decision problem is introduced. This model is suitable for problems where agents' posterior information is not shared and is possibly inconsistent with the mutual prior information. For a broad class of problems, every agent's dominant beliefs about the posterior information of the other agents are derived. Then, the level of interaction and the level of uncertainty are defined, and the relationship between these two levels is studied. It is shown that the optimal level of interaction decreases as the level of uncertainty increases, and in some cases, the optimal level of interaction tends to zero, suggesting that the optimization problem may be decomposed. The theoretical results are demonstrated on sensor network examples.",,第2页.xls
274,Fault tolerant and fixed scalable structure of middle-agents,2004,Middle-agents are used by end-agents to locate service providers in multi-agent systems. One central middle-agent represents a single point of failure and communication bottleneck in the system. Thus a structure of middle-agents can be used to overcome these issues. We designed and implemented a structure of middle-agents called dynamic hierarchical teams that has user-defined level of fault-tolerance and is moreover fixed scalable. We prove that the structure that has teams of size lambda has edge and vertex connectivity equal to lambda and is maximally fault tolerant. We focus on social knowledge management describing several methods that can be used for social knowledge propagation and related methods to search for knowledge in this structure. We also test the fault-tolerance of this structure in practical experiments.,,第2页.xls

We aim to probe their needs and preferences regarding agents for SEL by conducting co-design which involves children co-creating characters and social emotional stories. We conducted collaborative story-making activities with children aged four to six years old. Our findings could inform the design of both verbal and nonverbal interactions of agents, which are to be aligned with children's understanding and interest.

In such ad hoc team settings, team strategies cannot be developed a priori. Rather, an agent must be prepared to cooperate with many types of teammates: it must collaborate without pre-coordination. This article defines two aspects of collaboration in two-player teams, involving either simultaneous or sequential decision making. In both cases, the ad hoc agent is more knowledgeable of the environment, and attempts to influence the behavior of its teammate such that they will attain the optimal possible joint utility.

In other words, the problem of the agent's power is ignored. The paper discusses attempts to solve the problem of adoption between autonomous agents, emphasizing the critical point of reciprocation.

283,Hybrid Intelligence: Collaboration with AI Systems for Knowledge Work,2023,"With AI agents or generative AI systems such as ChatGPT/GPT-4, very powerful assistance systems will be widely available in the foreseeable future. These assistance systems can be used in a wide variety of occupational fields and for a wide variety of tasks. This raises questions about (1) the options for shaping the cooperation between humans and AI agents, (2) the interaction between human and artificial intelligence and (3) the competences required for successful cooperation with intelligent assistance systems. Previous modelling of AI competences remains rather general and is clearly not specified in terms of what knowledge, skills and attitudes are required for successful interaction with generative AI assistance systems such as ChatGPT, Midjourney or GitHub Copilot. This is the starting point for this paper, which is based on a deductive-conceptual approach as well as on the review and analysis of selected literature in the research fields of Human-Machine Collaboration and Hybrid Intelligence. With regard to the cooperation of humans and AI agents, different types of co-operation and levels of intensity of cooperation can be distinguished. In addition, different roles for AI agents as team members can also be distinguished (e.g., assis-tant, coordinator, doer, expert). Humans and AI agents bring different strengths to the collaboration, resulting in hybrid intelligence. However, successful collaboration also requires suitable framework conditions as well as attitudes and mindsets of the people involved (e.g.,a growth mindset). This is linked to important management tasks, such as establishing ethical guidelines or growth mindset cultures in companies and organisations.",,第2页.xls
284,Relating the entropy of joint beliefs to multi-agent coordination,2003,"Current approaches to activity coordination in multi-agent systems (teams) range from strictly top down (plan-based coordination) to purely emergent (reactive coordination), with many hybrid variants, each having its specific advantages and disadvantages. It appears to be extremely difficult to rigorously compare various hybrid approaches to multi-agent coordination (and communication), given the lack of a generic semantics or some guidelines. In this paper, we studied some intuitive inter-agent communication policies and characterised them in terms of generic information-theoretic properties. In particular, the relative entropy of joint beliefs was suggested as an indicator of teams coordination potential. Our novel behaviour-based agent architecture (based on the Deep Behaviour Projection framework) enabled consistent reasoning about belief change, including beliefs about other agents. This allowed us to examine some of the identified communication policies empirically. The obtained results confirmed that there are certain interesting invariants - in particular, a change in team coordination (and overall performance) was shown to be within the boundaries indicated by the relative information entropy.",,第2页.xls
285,A representation for coordination fault detection in large-scale multi-agent systems,2009,"Teamwork requires that team members coordinate their actions. The representation of the coordination is a key requirement since it influences the complexity and flexibility of reasoning team-members. One aspect of this requirement is detecting coordination faults as a result of intermittent failures of sensors, communication failures, etc. Detection of such faults, based on observations of the behavior of agents, is of prime importance. Though different solutions have been presented thus far, none has presented a comprehensive and efficient resolution for large-scale teams. This paper presents a formal approach to representing multi-agent coordination, and multi-agent observations, using matrix structures. This representation facilitates easy representation of coordination requirements, modularity, flexibility and reuse of existing systems. Based on this representation, we present a novel solution for fault-detection that is both generic and efficient for large-scale teams. We demonstrate the modularity of the representation by presenting a reuse of existing systems and by importing other models (e.g. hierarchical systems) into the new representation. Finally, we extend the representation to support dynamical aspects of complex systems.",,第2页.xls

This type of resources has associated the spending of money. There are two distinct types of teams: American and German. These two highly distinct models have specific characteristics that shape their patterns and dynamics. One characteristic that has been understudied in the literature is the resources consumption. To understand this issue, a multi-agent based model was developed to analyse each type of teams according to specific and critical aspects. After several simulations, it could be observed that German teams despite their focus on efficiency, were more compulsive consumers of human resources than American ones. The article also looks at hybrid teams where companies have a mix of both models. These teams tended to display more similarities with the German rather than the American model.",,第2页.xls

288,Embracing AWKWARD! Real-Time Adjustment of Reactive Plans Using Social Norms,2022,"This paper presents the AWKWARD architecture for the development of hybrid agents in Multi-Agent Systems. AWKWARD agents can have their plans re-configured in real time to align with social role requirements under changing environmental and social circumstances. The proposed hybrid architecture makes use of Behaviour Oriented Design (BOD) to develop agents with reactive planning and of the well-established OperA framework to provide organisational, social, and interaction definitions in order to validate and adjust agents' behaviours. Together, OperA and BOD can achieve real-time adjustment of agent plans for evolving social roles, while providing the additional benefit of transparency into the interactions that drive this behavioural change in individual agents. We present this architecture to motivate the bridging between traditional symbolic- and behaviour-based AI communities, where such combined solutions can help MAS researchers in their pursuit of building stronger, more robust intelligent agent teams. We use DOTA2-a game where success is heavily dependent on social interactions-as a medium to demonstrate a sample implementation of our proposed hybrid architecture.",,第2页.xls
289,Tracking dynamic team activity,1996,"AI researchers are striving to build complex multi-agent worlds with intended applications ranging from the RoboCup robotic soccer tournaments to interactive virtual theatre to large-scale real-world battlefield simulations. Agent trackingmonitoring other agent's actions and inferring their higher-level goals and intentionsis a central requirement in such worlds. While previous work has mostly focused on tracking individual agents, this paper goes beyond by focusing on agent teams. Team tracking poses the challenge of tracking a team's joint goals and plans. Dynamic, real-time environments add to the challenge, as ambiguities have to be resolved in real-time. The central hypothesis underlying this paper is that an explicit team-oriented perspective enables effective team tracking. This hypothesis is instantiated using the model tracing technology employed in tracking individual agents. Thus, to track team activities, team models are put to service. Team models are a concrete application of the joint intentions framework and enable an agent to track team activities, regardless of the agent's being a collaborative participant or a non-participant in the team. To facilitate real-time ambiguity resolution with team models: (i) aspects of tracking are cast as constraint satisfaction problems to exploit constraint propagation techniques; and (ii) a cost minimality criterion is applied to constrain the tracking search. Empirical results from two separate tasks in real-world, dynamic environmentsone collaborative and one competitiveare provided.",,第2页.xls

297,Genetic Team Composition and Level of Selection in the Evolution of Cooperation,2009,"In cooperative multiagent systems, agents interact to solve tasks. Global dynamics of multiagent teams result from local agent interactions, and are complex and difficult to predict. Evolutionary computation has proven a promising approach to the design of such teams. The majority of current studies use teams composed of agents with identical control rules (genetically homogeneous teams) and select behavior at the team level (team-level selection). Here we extend current approaches to include four combinations of genetic team composition and level of selection. We compare the performance of genetically homogeneous teams evolved with individual-level selection, genetically homogeneous teams evolved with team-level selection, genetically heterogeneous teams evolved with individual-level selection, and genetically heterogeneous teams evolved with team-level selection. We use a simulated foraging task to show that the optimal combination depends on the amount of cooperation required by the task. Accordingly, we distinguish between three types of cooperative tasks and suggest guidelines for the optimal choice of genetic team composition and level of selection.",,第2页.xls

Drawing on six months of experimenting with LLMs in internal and client innovation projects, we share first-hand experiences and concrete examples of AI-assisted approaches. The article highlights a large variety of use cases for generative AI ranging from user journey mapping to idea generation and prototyping and foreshadows the promising role LLMs may play in future knowledge management systems. Moreover, we argue that generative AI may become a game changer in early prototyping as the delegation of tasks to an artificial agent can result in faster iterations and reduced costs. Our experiences also provide insights into how human innovation teams purposively and effectively interact with AIs and integrate them into their workflows.",,第2页.xls
301,The Utility of Explainable AI in Ad Hoc Human-Machine Teaming,2021,"Recent advances in machine learning have led to growing interest in Explainable AI (xAI) to enable humans to gain insight into the decision-making of machine learning models. Despite this recent interest, the utility of xAI techniques has not yet been characterized in human-machine teaming. Importantly, xAI offers the promise of enhancing team situational awareness (SA) and shared mental model development, which are the key characteristics of effective human-machine teams. Rapidly developing such mental models is especially critical in ad hoc human-machine teaming, where agents do not have a priori knowledge of others' decision-making strategies. In this paper, we present two novel human-subject experiments quantifying the benefits of deploying xAI techniques within a human-machine teaming scenario. First, we show that xAI techniques can support SA (p < 0.05). Second, we examine how different SA levels induced via a collaborative AI policy abstraction affect ad hoc human-machine teaming performance. Importantly, we find that the benefits of xAI are not universal, as there is a strong dependence on the composition of the human-machine team. Novices benefit from xAI providing increased SA (p < 0.05) but are susceptible to cognitive overhead (p < 0.05). On the other hand, expert performance degrades with the addition of xAI-based support (p < 0.05), indicating that the cost of paying attention to the xAI outweighs the benefits obtained from being provided additional information to enhance SA. Our results demonstrate that researchers must deliberately design and deploy the right xAI techniques in the right scenario by carefully considering human-machine team composition and how the xAI method augments SA.",,第2页.xls
302,Reinforcement distribution in a team of cooperative Q-learning agents,2008,"In a Q-learning multi-agent group, agents cooperate each other to perform their assigned task during their learning for increasing the team performance. If the role of each agent clearly specified-which is a very hard task for a supervisor agent- the team will learn more efficiently. Indeed, in this cage each agent reinforced according to its real effect on the team Performance.Assuming an identical role for all agents is the most prevalent technique of current researchers to escape the modeling complexities. But we believe this is not the optimum method for reinforcement distribution. The main goal of this research is to find an indirect evaluation method which evaluates the role of each agent in the team and distributes the reinforcement signal accordingly. The expertness of each agent is used as a criterion to estimate the effect of each agent's action on the team performance.Random and equal reinforcement signal distribution methods are also used in order to evaluate expertness-based reinforcement sharing. In addition, a new test bed, called EPIDEM, is developed to evaluate the proposed methods. The results show, the distribution of the reinforcement signals based on the proposed method improves the team learning speed.",,第2页.xls
303,Recognizing probabilistic opponent movement models,2002,"In multiagent adversarial domains, team agents should adapt to the environment and opponent. We introduce a model representation as part of a planning process for a simulated soccer domain. The planning is centralized, but the plans are executed in a multi-agent environment, with teammate and opponent agents. Further, we present a recognition algorithm where the model which most closely matches the behavior of the opponents can be selected from few observations of the opponent. Empirical results are presented to verify that important information is maintained through the abstraction the models provide.",,第2页.xls

Evolving the separate team members in a single chromosome limits the capacity of the genetic algorithm to learn. Evolving the separate team members in separate populations promotes specialization and gives the genetic algorithm more flexibility to produce a solution, but can be either computationally prohibitive or result in credit assignment complications. In this paper, we apply punctuated anytime learning to assist in the co-evolution of separate team member populations. A box-pushing task is used to show the success of this method.",,第2页.xls

306,The Compare of Solo Programming Strategies in a Scrum Team: A Multi-agent Simulation Tool for Scrum Team Dynamics,2019,"Scrum is an agile framework within which people can address complex problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. A strategy is a way that people going to solve problems based on the existing situation. Team strategy research is different from team composition and how it affects the performance. Team composition can affect the performance is an existing knowledge, without doing simulation, we still can know how personality and capability can affect its performance. But strategy and task allocations methods are a further research go beyond that, particular in an environment, such as scrum, that has an aim for why the team needs to be composed. With the same team, the same task but different strategy can cause significant various outcome for each sprint. This is the way that agent-based modelling is more useful than just say that team composition can affect its work. And based on the current information, to do investigation on how team composition can affect performance will needs various teams, but how strategies can affect team performance will only need the same team to be compared. Scrum is the major motivation that why team needs a strategy to work, the purpose of this strategy is not to investigate how team composition can affect the work but more about how to use the existing affect from the team composition to get the Scrum success rate enhanced, as in real world, we could not change the team as the company only has the team to do the job, but we can change the way that they are doing the job.",,第2页.xls
307,Using agent- and organisation-oriented programming to develop a team of agents for a competitive game,2010,"The multi-agent programming contest uses a cow-herding scenario where two teams of cooperative agents compete for resources against each other. We developed such a team of agents using two well-known platforms, one based on a logic-based agent-oriented programming language, called Jason, and the other based on an organisational model, called Moise. While there is significant research on both agent programming and agent organisations, this was one of the first applications of a combined approach where we can program deliberative agents and organise them using a sophisticated organisational model.

309,Clustering Behavior to Recognize Subjective Beliefs in Human-Agent Teams,2018,"Trust is critical to the success of human-agent teams, and a critical antecedents to trust is transparency. To best interact with human teammates, an agent explain itself so that they understand its decision-making process. However, individual differences among human teammates require that the agent dynamically adjust its explanation strategy based on their unobservable subjective beliefs. The agent must therefore recognize its teammates' subjective beliefs relevant to trust-building (e.g., their understanding of the agent's capabilities and process). We leverage a nonparametric method to enable an agent to use its history of prior interactions as a means for recognizing and predicting a new teammate's subjective beliefs. We first gather data combining observable behavior sequences with survey-based observations of typically unobservable perceptions. We then use a nearest-neighbor approach to identify the prior teammates most similar to the new one. We use these neighbors' responses to infer the likelihood of possible beliefs, as in collaborative filtering. The results provide insights into the types of beliefs that are easy (and hard) to infer from purely behavioral observations.",,第2页.xls
310,Making Allocations Collectively: Iterative Group Decision Making under Uncertainty,2008,"A major challenge in the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is to enable autonomous agents to allocate tasks and resources efficiently. This paper studies an extended approach to a problem we refer to as the Collective Iterative Allocation (CIA) problem. This problem involves a group of agents that progressively refine allocations of teams to tasks. This paper considers the case where the performance of a team is variable and non-deterministic. This requires that each agent is able to maintain and update its probabilistic models using observations of each team's performance. A key result is that each agent needs the capacity to store only two or three observations of a team's performance to find near optimal allocations, and a further increase of this capacity will reduce the number of reallocations significantly.",,第2页.xls

312,"Teamwork in real-world, dynamic environments",1996,"Flexible teamwork in real-world multi-agent domains is more than a union of agents' simultaneous execution of individual plans, even if such execution is pre-coordinated. Indeed, uncertainties in complex, dynamic domains often obstruct preplanned coordination, with a resultant breakdown in teamwork. The central hypothesis in this paper is that for effective teamwork, agents should be provided with explicit team plans and an underlying model of teamwork that explicitly outlines their commitments and responsibilities as participants in team activities. Such a model enables team members to flexibly reason about coordination activities. The underlying model we provide is based on the joint intentions framework; although we present some key modifications to reflect the practical constraints in (some) real-world domains. This framework has been implemented in the context of a real-world synthetic environment for helicopter-combat simulation; some empirical results are presented.",,第2页.xls

This paper describes an approach for the development of cooperation models for eldercare robot teams using goal-driven control components. The framework and the approach are illustrated through the development and assessment of task allocation in multi-robot teams. Two cooperation models are implemented: (i) a team model based on the adaptive multi-agent systems theory where task responsibility is agreed among team peers by exchanging individual estimations of the degree of difficulty and priority to achieve the task; (ii) a hierarchical model where a robot manager asks for the estimations of its team members and then assigns the task.

The effective integration of AI-enabled robots as teammates with humans will provide support and enhance overall mission performance; however, the majority of current research on human-robot interaction focuses only on the robot team supervisor. The true integration of robots into military and first response missions will require a breadth of human roles that span from the highest command level to the dismounted in situ personnel working directly with robots. All human roles within the hierarchy must understand and maintain direct control of the robot teammates.

Steve continuously monitors the state of the virtual world, periodically manipulating it through virtual motor actions. His objective is to help students learn to perform physical, procedural tasks. He can demonstrate tasks, explaining his actions, as well as monitor students performing tasks, providing help when they need it. In addition to teaching students individual tasks, he can also help them learn to perform multi-person team tasks: he can serve as a tutor for a student learning a particular role in the team, and he can play the role of a team mate when a human team mate is unavailable.

In this article a framework for building teams of responsible agents using roles, responsibilities and strategies is described. Its application to the domain of soccer is used to design a high-performance team of soccer agents. The architecture for these agents utilizes a reactive planning system with support for teamwork.

325,Multi-agent Simulation of Knowledge Innovation Activities of University Research Team,2009,"As research continues to fuel economic growth of many developing countries, such as in China, how to cultivate knowledge and resource has become increasingly important. Universities are widely regarded not only as teaching establishments but also as organizations that create new knowledge and innovation through research. Research teams are the main organizational nucleus in universities that create new knowledge (Chataway and Wield, 2000). However, a university research team in developing countries always does small-scale basic research solely, ignoring the influence of the academic and market environment as well as other reams. Actually, a research team can acquire extra knowledge, resources and information from the environment and from other teams. Therefore, understanding how a university research team to interact with other teams and the environment and the results of these interactions has become to a requirement to cultivate research team in universities.

327,Effective Team Interaction for Adaptive Training and Situation Awareness in Human-Autonomy Teaming,2019,"The aim of this exploratory paper is to underline the importance of coordination-based training for dynamic tasks in human-autonomy teaming. We address training solutions to distinct types of failures caused by either internal (the system) and external sources (the dynamic task environment). In order to accomplish this, we explore Human-Autonomy teaming communication and coordination with comprehensive scenarios drawn from the pilot tests and look at team needs to successfully overcome complex and dynamic failures. Findings from these two failure events are two-fold: (1) in order to adapt to dynamic environments and overcome unexpected failures, teams should receive role-related training (static and knowledge-based) as well as training about how to interact with one another (dynamic and coordination-based) and (2) designing synthetic agents with effective team coordination mechanisms will help future team training exercises. Current and future work is focused on additional experimentation on team training in the context of Human-Autonomy teams. Furthermore, future experimentation should highlight additional requirements needed for designing synthetic teammates and also dynamic task training necessary to produce effective teamwork.",,第2页.xls

An exploration of people's ' s perceptions, appraisals, and emotions related to a Gen-AI text-to-image model and its creations",2025,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has rapidly advanced in recent years, potentially producing enormous impacts on industries, societies, and individuals in the near future. In particular, Gen-AI text-to-image models allow people to easily create high-quality images possibly revolutionizing human creative practices. Despite their increasing use, however, the broader population's perceptions and understandings of Gen-AI-generated images remain understudied in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community. This study investigates how individuals, including those unfamiliar with Gen-AI, perceive Gen-AI text-to-image (Stable Diffusion) outputs. Study findings reveal that participants appraise Gen-AI images based on their technical quality and fidelity in representing a subject, often experiencing them as either prototypical or strange: these experiences may raise awareness of societal biases and evoke unsettling feelings that extend to the Gen-AI itself. The study also uncovers several relational strategies that participants employ to cope with concerns related to Gen-AI, contributing to the understanding of reactions to uncanny technology and the (de)humanization of intelligent agents. Moreover, the study offers design suggestions on how to use the anthropomorphizing of the text-to-image model as design material, and the Gen-AI images as support for critical design sessions.",,第2页.xls

Team-control plans are representations of the composition and behavior of groups of agents and include the definition of one or more roles. Genetic programming is a general problem solving technique, and using genetic programming as a means for creating team plans would allow the user to specify very little, while producing effective results.

The state transition kernels are parametrized by an unknown but fixed parameter taking values in a finite space. We study a decentralized Thompson sampling based approach to learn the underlying parameter where each agent maintains a belief about the underlying parameter. The agents draw a sample from their beliefs at each time and select their action using the benchmark policy for the sampled parameter. We show that under some assumptions on the state transition kernels, the regret achieved by Thompson sampling is upper bounded by a constant independent of the time horizon.",,第2页.xls
331,Adaptive Switching Behavioral Strategies for Effective Team Formation in Changing Environments,2017,"This paper proposes a control method for in agents by switching their behavioral strategy between rationality and reciprocity depending on their internal states to achieve efficient team formation. Advances in computer science, telecommunications, and electronic devices have led to proposals of a variety of services on the Internet that are achieved by teams of different agents. To provide these services efficiently, the tasks to achieve them must be allocated to appropriate agents that have the required capabilities, and the agents must not be overloaded. Furthermore, agents have to adapt to dynamic environments, especially to frequent changes in workload. Conventional decentralized allocation methods often lead to conflicts in large and busy environments because high-capability agents are likely to be identified as the best team member by many agents, resulting in the entire system becoming inefficient due to the concentration of task allocation when the workload becomes high. Our proposed agents switch their strategies in accordance with their local evaluation to avoid conflicts occurring in busy environments. They also establish an organization in which a number of groups are autonomously generated in a bottom-up manner on the basis of dependability to avoid conflicts in advance while ignoring tasks allocated by undependable/unreliable agents. We experimentally evaluated our method in static and dynamic environments where the number of tasks varied.",,第2页.xls
332,Automatic generation of communication and teamwork within multi-agent teams,2001,"Teamwork and communication are two important processes within multi-agent systems designed to act in a coherent and coordinated manner. Modeling teamwork involves interleaving steps within shared plans that will allow agents to work together towards common goals. These steps involve reasoning about roles, responsibilities, and joint-intentions in order to coordinate activity amongst individuals. Communication facilitates teamwork. There are various complex forms of communication such as synchronization, coordination, and cooperation that allow for members of teams to use teamwork to their advantage. Explicitly defining every possible communication point within a team plan is too cumbersome and inflexible. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically decompose a team plan into a collection of individual agent plans, inserting all of the necessary communication points needed to properly generate coordinated behavior. This approach could be used to more accurately and easily model teamwork in multi-agent systems.",,第2页.xls

334,AutoAgents: A Framework for Automatic Agent Generation [arXiv],2023,"Large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable advances in automated task-solving with multi-agent systems. However, most existing LLM-based multi-agent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios. Therefore, we introduce AutoAgents, an innovative framework that adaptively generates and coordinates multiple specialized agents to build an AI team according to different tasks. Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks.

335,Multi-agent system for formation flying missions,2001,"Currently, spacecraft are not operated as autonomous coordinated teams. Generalized reasoning capability offered by advanced distributed software technology and Al have the potential to cope with unexpected events and uncertainty and allow to close the loop of perception, decision and eventually deliberation, on board. The team members play different interchangeable roles and they negotiate the task that they are achieving together. We present a multi-agent system to provide a high degree of autonomy and support for coordination among team members. We use JPL formation flying mission initial architectures as benchmark. Our target is to avoid inconsistencies/disagreements between two or more participants in a collaborative context, increase the system's fault tolerance in cases such as loss of a member while the system should be able to still reliably operate. We address the cooperation between independent autonomous agents when they have to collaborate to achieve a common goal. In a top-down organization, agents are coordinated in a hierarchical fashion, where the agents at the top of the hierarchy make the majority of the intelligent group decisions. In a more structured, but still hierarchical organization, lower-level agents exercise more intelligence in making group decisions. A lower-level agent can advance a plan for the others to follow, and then a higher rank agent will decide on the best plans produced by individual agents. Although more rigid, the centralized intelligence organization allows for less communication among agents, so is more straightforward to implement. The decentralized approach requires more communication, but the intelligence is truly distributed, which makes for a more flexible, adaptive and efficient organization.",,第2页.xls
336,Negotiating team formation using deep reinforcement learning,2020,"When autonomous agents interact in the same environment, they must often cooperate to achieve their goals. One way for agents to cooperate effectively is to form a team, make a binding agreement on a joint plan, and execute it. However, when agents are self-interested, the gains from team formation must be allocated appropriately to incentivize agreement. Various approaches for multi-agent negotiation have been proposed, but typically only work for particular negotiation protocols. More general methods usually require human input or domain-specific data, and so do not scale. To address this, we propose a framework for training agents to negotiate and form teams using deep reinforcement learning. Importantly, our method makes no assumptions about the specific negotiation protocol, and is instead completely experience driven. We evaluate our approach on both non-spatial and spatially extended team-formation negotiation environments, demonstrating that our agents beat hand-crafted bots and reach negotiation outcomes consistent with fair solutions predicted by cooperative game theory. Additionally, we investigate how the physical location of agents influences negotiation outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第2页.xls

339,Consensus of Multi-agent Systems with State Constraints: A Unified View of Opinion Dynamics and Containment Control,2015,"This paper focuses on the study of consensus for a team of agents with continuous dynamics in the presence of state constraints. Due to the existence of state constraints, most existing consensus algorithms cannot be applied directly and thus a novel consensus algorithm is proposed to deal with state constraints. The novel consensus algorithm is shown to guarantee consensus when a few conditions are satisfied. Then we study opinion dynamics for a team of stubborn agents. By introducing virtual agents appropriately, it is shown that the study of opinion dynamics for stubborn agents can be reformulated as consensus for cooperative agents in the presence of state constraints. Such a formulation is similar to the existing study on containment control with stationary leaders. Based on the existing results from containment control literature, the final team opinions can be derived efficiently. Finally, a generalized opinion evolution problem is considered when agents are stubborn and have state constraints. Some upper and lower bounds of the team's final opinions are obtained by using the comparison lemma.",,第2页.xls

The approach is based on simulating the design process using a multi-agent system that mimics the behavior of the design team. The system activates the pieces of design knowledge when they become applicable. The use of knowledge by agents is recorded by tracing the steps that the agents have taken during a design project. Many traces are generated by solving a large number of design projects that differ in their requirements. A set of design methodologies is constructed by using clustering techniques to generalize the traces. These methodologies can be used to guide design teams through design projects.,,第2页.xls

In particular, agents need to be able to reconcile their intentions to do team-related actions with other, conflicting intentions. We present the SPIRE experimental system that allows the process of intention reconciliation in team contexts to be simulated and studied.

343,Joint Human-Agent Activities: Challenges and Definition,2016,"When the situation involves artificial and natural agents in the same environment that work together to achieve joint goals we talk about cooperative activities, human-agent teamwork, joint activities, or joint human-agent activities. Although, teamwork has become a widely accepted metaphor for multi-robot/multi-agent cooperation there are several challenges towards making agents teammates - some of them are present independently from the teams mixture, whereas others are particularly challenging for the development of human-agent teams. This work presents an overview about the challenges and brings together knowledge from the different involved research areas, further, we provide an attempt to define the term joint human-agent activity in order to motivate a discussion about the necessary elements.",,第2页.xls
344,Leveraging Reinforcement Learning in Red Teaming for Advanced Ransomware Attack Simulations,2024,"Ransomware presents a significant and increasing threat to individuals and organizations by encrypting their systems and not releasing them until a large fee has been extracted. To bolster preparedness against potential attacks, organizations commonly conduct red teaming exercises, which involve simulated attacks to assess existing security measures. This paper proposes a novel approach utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to simulate ransomware attacks. By training an RL agent in a simulated environment mirroring real-world networks, effective attack strategies can be learned quickly, significantly streamlining traditional, manual penetration testing processes. The attack pathways revealed by the RL agent can provide valuable insights to the defense team, helping them identify network weak points and develop more resilient defensive measures. Experimental results on a 152-host example network confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the RL agent's capability to discover and orchestrate attacks on high-value targets while evading honeyfiles (decoy files strategically placed to detect unauthorized access).",,第2页.xls

347,Teaching Social Behavior through Human Reinforcement for Ad hoc Teamwork - The STAR Framework,2019,"As AI technology continues to develop, more and more agents will become capable of long term autonomy alongside people. Thus, a recent line of research has studied the problem of teaching autonomous agents the concept of ethics and human social norms. Most existing work considers the case of an individual agent attempting to learn a predefined set of rules. In reality however, social norms are not always pre-defined and are very difficult to represent algorithmically. Moreover, the basic idea behind the social norms concept is ensuring that one's actions do not negatively influence others' utilities, which is inherently a multiagent concept. Thus, here we investigate a way to teach agents, as a team, how to act according to human social norms. In this research, we introduce the star framework used to teach an ad hoc team of agents to act in accordance with human social norms. Using a hybrid team (agents and people), when taking an action considered to be socially unacceptable, the agents receive negative feedback from the human teammate(s) who has(have) an awareness of the team's norms. We view star as an important step towards teaching agents to act more consistently with respect to human morality.",,第2页.xls

It presents an environment where two robot teams play soccer, with all the challenges that this task brings-up. In this environment each player has its own vision system, there is no single agent that has a global view of the field. Another restriction is that a very narrow communication band-width is allowed to inter-agent communication.

350,A market-based adaptation for resolving competing needs for scarce resources,2006,"The dynamic nature of many real-world domains (e.g., military, emergency first response and hurricane relief, etc) requires adaptive resource allocation to respond to changes in the environment that trigger additional resource requirements. Since the total resources are limited, there are often conflicts among various tasks regarding their resource needs. Thus, resources must be reallocated in order to maximize global utility for the current situation. This problem is further complicated when scarce resources are owned by distributed teams, each of which needs to allocate resources among tasks assigned to them, because each team has limited information about the other teams' resources and states. In this paper, we propose a market-based approach that uses an agent-based auction mechanism to enable teams to communicate and coordinate their utility information about possibly competing resource needs. As a result, the teams can collaboratively assess trade-offs among competing needs to allocate resources efficiently.",,第2页.xls

357,Who is Undercover? Guiding LLMs to Explore Multi-Perspective Team Tactic in the Game,2024,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal AI agents in complex tasks but still face challenges in open decision-making problems within complex scenarios. To address this, we use the language logic game ``Who is Undercover?'' (WIU) as an experimental platform to propose the Multi-Perspective Team Tactic (MPTT) framework. MPTT aims to cultivate LLMs' human-like language expression logic, multi-dimensional thinking, and self-perception in complex scenarios. By alternating speaking and voting sessions, integrating techniques like self-perspective, identity-determination, self-reflection, self-summary and multi-round find-teammates, LLM agents make rational decisions through strategic concealment and communication, fostering human-like trust. Preliminary results show that MPTT, combined with WIU, leverages LLMs' cognitive capabilities to create a decision-making framework that can simulate real society. This framework aids minority groups in communication and expression, promoting fairness and diversity in decision-making. Additionally, our Human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that LLMs can learn and align with human behaviors through interactive, indicating their potential for active participation in societal decision-making.",,第2页.xls
358,The benefits of arguing in a team,1999,"In a complex, dynamic multiagent setting, coherent team actions are often jeopardized by conflicts in agents' beliefs, plans, and actions. Despite the considerable progress in teamwork research, the challenge of intrateam conflict resolution has remained largely unaddressed. The article presents CONSA, a system we are developing to resolve conflicts using argumentation-based negotiations. CONSA focuses on exploiting the benefits of argumentation in a team setting. Thus, CONSA casts conflict resolution as a team problem, so that the advances in teamwork can be brought to bear during conflict resolution to improve argumentation flexibility. Furthermore, because teamwork conflicts sometimes involve past teamwork, teamwork models can be exploited to provide agents with reusable argumentation knowledge. Additionally, CONSA also includes argumentation strategies geared toward benefiting the team, rather than the individual, and techniques to reduce argumentation overhead.",,第2页.xls

Central to this improved capacity is the manner in which the organization's member agents are related. This study is an initial investigation into the role and potential of interagent ties in computational teaming. A computational team-based model, designed to more fully integrate agent ties, is created and presented. It is applied to a bulk manufacturing process-planning problem and its performance compared against a previously tested agent-based algorithm without these agent relationships. The performance of the new agent method showed significant improvement over the previous method: improving solution quality 280% and increasing solution identification per unit time an entire order of magnitude. A statistical examination of the new algorithm confirms that agent interdependencies are the strongest and most consistent performance effects leading to the observed improvements. This study illustrates that the interagent ties associated with team collaboration can be a highly effective method of improving computational design performance, and the results are promising indications that the application of organization constructs within a computational context may significantly improve computational problem solving.",,第2页.xls

The CCPSO(t) algorithm is applied to train a team of agents to play simple soccer. The algorithm uses the charged particle swarm optimiser in a competitive and cooperative coevolutionary training environment to train neural network controllers for the players. The CCPSO(t) algorithm makes use of the FIFA league ranking relative fitness function to gather detailed performance metrics from each game played. The training performance and convergence behaviour of the particle swarm are analysed. A hypothesis is presented that explains the lack of convergence in the particle swarms. After applying a clustering algorithm on the particle positions, a detailed visual and quantitative analysis of the player strategies is presented. The final results show that the CCPSO(t) algorithm is capable of evolving complex gameplay strategies for a complex non-deterministic game.",,第2页.xls

In this paper, we describe the strategies used by our team that led us to achieve first place in the contest. Our strategies tackle some of the major challenges in the 2019 contest: how to explore and build a map when agents only have access to local vision and no global coordinates; how to move around the map efficiently even though there are dynamic events that can change the cells in the grid; and how to assemble and submit complex block structures given that the opposing team may try to sabotage us. To implement our strategies, we use the multi-agent systems development platform JaCaMo to program our agents and the Fast Downward planner to plan the movement of the agent in the grid.

369,Autonomous Workflow for Multimodal Fine-Grained Training Assistants Towards Mixed Reality,2024,"Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents have emerged as promising protocols for automatically understanding the language-based environment, particularly with the exponential development of large language models (LLMs). However, a fine-grained, comprehensive understanding of multimodal environments remains under-explored. This work designs an autonomous workflow tailored for integrating AI agents seamlessly into extended reality (XR) applications for fine-grained training. We present a demonstration of a multimodal fine-grained training assistant for LEGO brick assembly in a pilot XR environment. Specifically, we design a cerebral language agent that integrates LLM with memory, planning, and interaction with XR tools and a vision-language agent, enabling agents to decide their actions based on past experiences. Furthermore, we introduce LEGO-MRTA, a multimodal fine-grained assembly dialogue dataset synthesized automatically in the workflow served by a commercial LLM. This dataset comprises multimodal instruction manuals, conversations, XR responses, and vision question answering.

370,TEAM FORMATION FOR AGENT COOPERATION IN LOGISTICS Protocol Design and Complexity Analysis,2011,"Supply network management is a challenging task due to the complexity, dynamics, and distribution of logistics processes. Delegating process control to intelligent software agents that represent logistics objects and act on their behalf helps approach these challenges. The resulting problem decomposition reduces the computational complexity. Dynamics can be dealt with locally. An important prerequisite for coordinated process control is that agents can cooperate with each other. Based on requirements from logistics, this paper presents an interaction protocol for team formation. A thorough complexity analysis for the proposed method is conducted because the arising interaction effort is not obvious as it depends on the number of teams formed. Therewith, agent developers can estimate the interaction effort and thus the applicability of the method in advance. Finally, an application of the introduced protocol is outlined.",,第2页.xls

This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both the AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities.

373,Field Friction Recognition and State Inference in AI Soccer,2022,"In this paper, we introduce an approach for friction recognition and state inference under environment where field friction changes. We use a robot soccer-based challenge environment, AI Soccer, where two teams of two-wheeled agents compete to win a game of soccer. We modify the AI Soccer simulator to make the friction coefficient between the agent wheels and the field intermittently changes to add more complexity on the challenge. The friction change causes the AI Soccer's agents to run in a slippery environment time to time that the agents need to adapt their controls in order to play the game properly. As the agents are not equipped with sensors usable for friction detection, we develop a friction recognition classifier with multilayer perceptron based on agents' coordinates and their wheel speed signals. However, the classification of the environmental friction would not be sufficient state information for the agents to perform well under the dynamic environment as behaviors of the ball or opponent agents would be affected by the friction as well. Detailed context information based on friction can help AI Soccer players make better decisions. Therefore, we in addition build a clustering module upon the trained multilayer perceptron classifier. clustering resonance network is adopted as the clustering module for the network's incremental and unsupervised learning capability. Through experiments we demonstrate our system can detect friction state of the AI Soccer field and infer further based on the learned features.",,第2页.xls

375,Optimal Rewards for Cooperative Agents,2014,"Following work on designing optimal rewards for single agents, we define a multiagent optimal rewards problem (ORP) in cooperative (specifically, common-payoff or team) settings. This new problem solves for individual agent reward functions that guide agents to better overall team performance relative to teams in which all agents guide their behavior with the same given team-reward function. We present a multiagent architecture in which each agent learns good reward functions from experience using a gradient-based algorithm in addition to performing the usual task of planning good policies (except in this case with respect to the learned rather than the given reward function). Multiagency introduces the challenge of nonstationarity: because the agents learn simultaneously, each agent's reward-learning problem is nonstationary and interdependent on the other agents evolving reward functions. We demonstrate on two simple domains that the proposed architecture outperforms the conventional approach in which all the agents use the same given team-reward function (even when accounting for the resource overhead of the reward learning); that the learning algorithm performs stably despite the nonstationarity; and that learning individual reward functions can lead to better specialization of roles than is possible with shared reward, whether learned or given.",,第2页.xls
376,A Collaborative Learning Automata Team Model for Modeling Multi-Agent Systems,2018,"The learning automaton (LA) team model has been proposed as one method for modeling multi-agent systems. It is modeled as a noncooperative game of learning automata. In this model, each LA operates independently from each other, and there exists a Nash equilibrium, that is, the existence of an optimal mixed strategy in the mixed strategy space of the game has been proven. However, for modeling multi-agent systems more generally, the information exchange among agents and the acquisition of cooperative behaviors such as the formation of autonomous community are required. In this paper, in order to complement the LA team model, we propose a new LA team model with some fully or partially collaborative learning behaviors. In this new model, each automaton performs reinforcement learning process in order to identify random environments exchanging information with its adjacent automata. Several computer simulations indicate the availability of the proposed model. (C) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,第2页.xls
377,The adaptive agent architecture: Achieving fault-tolerance using persistent broker teams,2000,"Brokered multi-agent systems can be incapacitated and rendered non-functional when the brokers become inaccessible due to failures that call occur in any distributed software system. We propose that the theory of teamwork call be used to specify robust brokered architectures that can recover from broker failures, and we present the Adaptive Agent Architecture (AAA) to show the feasibility of this approach. The previous teamwork theory based on joint intentions assumes that team members remain in a team as long as the team exists. We extend this theory to allow dynamic broker teams whose members can change with time. We also introduce a theory of restorative maintenance goals that enables the brokers in an AAA broker ream to start new brokers and recruit them to the broker team. As a result, an AAA-based multi-agent system can maintain a specified number of functional brokers in the system despite broker failures, thus effectively becoming a self-healing system.",,第2页.xls
378,LogMonitor: From player's action analysis to collaboration analysis and advice on formation,2000,"This paper describes analysis results of collaboration among players of RoboCup '98 simulator teams and on-line adversarial model analysis using LogMonitor. LogMonitor is a tool for analyzing games from logfiles and displaying statistical data such as counts of soccer plays. Evaluation of collaboration in a multi-agent system is closely related with applied domains, which make it difficult to distinguish agent's universal ability from task oriented programs. In viewing simulation soccer games, play agents' skills are evaluated from the human soccer standards. This situation is assumed to be similar to collaboration among teammates, that is evaluated from human standards.Adding to the basic actions of the player such as shooting, kicking, etc., a 1-2 pass among teammate agents is used to evaluate teams in collaboration. LogMonitor data shows that 1-2 pass may be useful to evaluate collaboration. Experiments show that adding adversarial information is very useful to make a team more robust.",,第2页.xls

Software agents have the ability to monitor progress and to offer advice by operating in the background, acting autonomously when the need arises. An agent prototype has been developed in Prolog to perform a limited set of functions to support students. Team projects have a planning, doing and completing stage, all of which require them to have some sort of agent support. This agent supports part of the planning stage, by prompting the students to input their likes, dislikes and abilities for a selection of task areas defined for the project. The agent then allocates the various tasks to the students according to predetermined rules. The results of a trial carried out using teams working on projects, on campus, indicate that students like the idea of using this agent to help with allocating tasks.",,第2页.xls

385,Learning team coordination constraints through execution,2000,"Agents working together in reams can tackle user-defined tasks more complex than those they can perform as individuals. However constructing such reams remains a difficult challenge. In particular current approaches to designing agent teams are highly labor-intensive. Human designers must deal with ovenwhelming complexity in thing to manage the large number of interactions and dependencies that may exist between agent activities. Even if the designer is able to come lip with a plan that seems to work, he cannot be sure that it will continue to work in all possible situations. In this work, we propose To use machine learning techniques to assist a user in building robust, multiagent team plans. This is done by logging information during team plan executions and attempting to find the cause of failure from this data. We present a method for learning temporal coordination constraints on actions in a multiagent reactive plan. We also briefly discuss the effect of new coordination constraints on team organization.",,第2页.xls
386,Human-Agent Collaboration for Time-Stressed Multicontext Decision Making,2010,"Multicontext team decision making under time stress is an extremely challenging issue faced by various real-world application domains. In this paper, we employ an experience-based cognitive agent architecture (called R-CAST) to address the informational challenges associated with military command and control (C-2) decision-making teams, the performance of which can be significantly affected by dynamic context switching and tasking complexities. Using context switching frequency and task complexity as two factors, we conducted an experiment to evaluate whether the use of R-CAST agents as teammates and decision aids can benefit C-2 decision-making teams. Members from a U. S. Army Reserve Officer Training Corps organization were randomly recruited as human participants. They were grouped into ten human-human teams, each composed of two participants, and ten human-agent teams, each composed of one participant and two R-CAST agents, as teammates and decision aids. The statistical inference of experimental results indicates that R-CAST agents can significantly improve the performance of C-2 teams in multi-context decision making under varying time-stressed situations.",,第2页.xls

391,The virtual collaborator - a definition and research agenda,2018,"The interdisciplinary research endeavor of computer-supported collaborative work has already investigated information technology that supports collaboration. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), new forms of collaboration need to be considered that involve AI as an active partner within a collaborative setting. Theories and design guidelines that support collaboration, considering cognitive and social group effects, need to be revised when team members are not solely human anymore. Within this exploratory study, the authors aim to provide insights of team members on their conception of a so-called virtual collaborator. A study with 144 participants was carried out to provide valuable information about collaboration principles, conceptual implementations and requirements. The results indicate that the participants are indecisive about a precise conception but expect an ideal collaborator that rather should not work on relevant tasks or make vital decisions. Based on the results, the authors compose new research questions and possible experiment settings.",,第2页.xls

393,Conversational case-based planning for agent team coordination,2001,"This paper describes a prototype in which a conversational case-based reasoner, NaCoDAE, was agentified and inserted in the RETSINA multi-agent system. Its task was to determine agent roles within a heterogeneous society of agents, where the agents may use capability-based or team-oriented agent coordination strategies. There were three reasons for assigning this task to NaCoDAE: (1) to relieve the agents of the overhead of determining, for themselves, if they should be involved in the task, or not; (2) to convert seemingly unrelated data into contextually relevant knowledge - as a case-based reasoning system, NaCoDAE is particularly suited for applying apparently incoherent data to a wide variety of domain-specific situations; and (3) as a conversational CBR system, to both unobtrusively listen to human statements and to proactively dialogue with other agents in a more goal-directed approach to gathering relevant information. The cases maintained by NaCoDAE have question and answer components, which were originally intended to maintain the textual representations of questions and answers for humans. By associating agent capability descriptions and queries with the case questions, NaCoDAE also assumed the team role of a capability-based coordinator. By encoding fragments of HTN plan objectives in its case actions, we were able to convert NaCoDAE into a conversational case-based planner that served compositionally-generated HTN plan objectives, already populated with situation-relevant knowledge, for use by the RETSINA team-oriented agents.(1)",,第2页.xls
394,Diagnosis of coordination failures: a matrix-based approach,2012,"One of the key requirements in many multi-agent teams is that agents coordinate specific aspects of their joint task. Unfortunately, this coordination may fail due to intermittent faults in sensor readings, communication faults, etc. A key challenge in the model-based diagnosis (MBD) of coordination failures is to represent a model of the coordination among the agents in a way that allows efficient detection and diagnosis, based on observation of the agents involved. Previously developed mechanisms are useful only for small groups of agents, since they represent the coordination with binary constraints. This paper presents a MBD approach to coordination failures in which non-binary constraints are allowed. This model has two inherent advantages: (1) the model enables to address real problems, (2) the model enables to address large groups by gathering multiple coordinations in one constraint. To solve the diagnosis problem, we propose a matrix-based approach to represent the basic building blocks of the MBD formalization. Theoretical and empirical evaluations show that this representation is efficient for large-scale teams.",,第2页.xls

398,An agent-based approach to engineering design,2002,"Among the features of concurrent engineering is the notion of distributed design, and the ability to communicate design changes to multidisciplinary teams. Engineering design is a complex activity. Differences in system architectures and information structures, and co-ordination requirements tend to reduce the effectiveness of distributed design. Current thinking indicates that multi-agent systems (MAS) can alleviate some of the complex engineering design problems. In this paper, it is argued that agent attributes such as proactiveness and autonomy can overcome these limitations. Agents provide a flexible and dynamic approach to distributed/multidisciplinary design team which can reduce redundant design activities, and improve coordination. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

399,Towards heterogeneous agent teams,2001,"Agent integration architectures enable a heterogeneous, distributed set of agents to work together to address problems of greater complexity than those addressed by the individual agents themselves. Unfortunately, integrating software agents and humans to perform real-world tasks in a large-scale system remains difficult, especially due to two key challenges: ensuring robust execution in the face of a dynamic environment and providing abstract task specifications without all the low-level coordination details. To address these challenges, our Teamcore project provides the integration architecture with general-purpose teamwork coordination capabilities. We make each agent team-ready by providing it with a proxy capable of general teamwork reasoning. Thus, a key novelty and strength of our framework is that powerful teamwork capabilities are built into its foundations by providing the proxies themselves with a teamwork model called STEAM. While STEAM has earlier been demonstrated in domains involving homogeneous agent teams, its use in Teamcore proxies illustrates that teamwork models may also be applied in domains involving heterogeneous agents. Given STEAM, the Teamcore proxies addresses the first agent integration challenge, robust execution, by automatically generating the required coordination actions for the agents they represent. We can also exploit the proxies' reusable general teamwork knowledge to address the second agent integration challenge. Through team-oriented programming, a developer specifies a hierarchical organization and its goals and plans, abstracting away from coordination details. Our integration architecture enables teamwork among agents with no coordination capabilities, and it establishes and automates consistent teamwork among agents with some coordination capabilities. We illustrate how the Teamcore architecture successfully addressed the challenges of agent integration in two application domains: simulated rehearsal of a military evacuation mission and facilitation of human collaboration.",,第2页.xls
400,Multi-agent system: A guiding metaphor for the organization of software development projects,2007,"In this work we propose the introduction of multi-agent concepts for the organization of software development projects of (especially multi-agent) application design and implementation. This is expressed by the guiding metaphor (German: Leitbild) of a multi-agent system of developers.Team orientation and concurrent development are two aspects that are crucial in every large development project. Consequently, the organizational structure of the programming team has to take account for both. If the developed application is distributed, concurrent and teamoriented - e.g. a multi-agent application - one approach is to aim for a comparable (homomorphic) structure of a developed system and development team. We achieve this by reintroducing the multi-agent system metaphor into the organizational structure of the development team.Agent attributes such as autonomy, communication, cooperation, selforganization and the capacity for teamwork are transferred by the guiding metaphor back to team members. Concurrency and distribution of resources and processes is naturally supported by the guiding metaphor.This guiding metaphor can be applied to any project organization. However, it is best suited for the organization of multi-agent application development, due to the similarity in structure.",,第2页.xls

404,A Tool but not a Peer: How Framing Affects People's Perceptions of AI Agents in Teams,2024,"In this paper, we set out to explore how people judge the personality of a non-anthropomorphic virtual agent during group interactions. Using a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) based approach, we observed that people judged the acceptability of a virtual agent's behavior from a tool-based lens, that is, if this robot and its behavior are useful to the team or not. Furthermore, we found that while people were able to acknowledge the virtual agent's personality and recognize its identity through social cues, the tool-based framing impacts these perceptions into a normative judgment of the robots' utility. We present two case studies that we think highlight this tool-based interpretation of robotic personality: robots expressing non-factual opinions and robots expressing humor. Finally, we suggest that researchers should consider the impact of this tool-based framing on people's perceptions of a robot's identity when designing robots for social interaction.",,第2页.xls
405,Modelling and Simulation of Scrum Team Strategies: A Multi-agent Approach,2020,"Scrum is a type of agile process that incrementally, iteratively and continuously deliver software based on sprint time box. It is composed by User Stories, product backlog, sprint backlog, scrum team and sprints. Scrum team take user stories from product backlog into sprint backlog to start each sprint and deliver products at the end of each sprint. Sprint retrospective and review occurs at the end of each sprint to evaluate the delivered products and team performance. Based on the Scrum guide, scrum is easy to be understood but hard to be measured. Especially, it is depended largely on the performance of team dynamics referring to team compositions and task allocations, as its optimization make big impact on each sprint result.This paper investigating how solo and pair programming can make impact on scrum team performance based on several designed innovative team working strategies for both solo and pair programming by using agent-based modelling. Such innovative team working strategies for solo and pair programming have not been designed or applied into scrum context for investigation and evaluation based on agent-based modelling. As Scrum is a very complex environment, so that different strategies can be compared through modelling and simulation under various scrum context, such as scrum has different team composition, different task distribution and some randomly events to occur.A simulation tool is also designed and developed to carry on scrum team modelling and simulation which has realized all the designed strategies to carry on experiments and evaluation.

409,"Garbage In, Garbage Out: mitigating human biases in data entry by means of artificial intelligence",2023,"Current HCI research often focuses on mitigating algorithmic biases. While such algorithmic fairness during model training is worthwhile, we see fit to mitigate human cognitive biases earlier, namely during data entry. We developed a conversational agent with voice-based data entry and visualization to support financial consultations, which are human-human settings with information asymmetries. In a pre-study, we reveal data-entry biases in advisors by a quantitative analysis of 5 advisors consulting 15 clients in total. Our main study evaluates the conversational agent with 12 advisors and 24 clients. A thematic analysis of interviews shows that advisors introduce biases by feeling and forgetting data. Additionally, the conversational agent makes financial consultations more transparent and automates data entry. These findings may be transferred to various dyads, such as doctor visits. Finally, we stress that AI not only poses a risk of becoming a mirror of human biases but also has the potential to intervene in the early stages of data entry.",,第2页.xls

In this paper, we investigate the influence of different reinforcement signals (local and global) and team diversity (homogeneous and heterogeneous agents) on the learned solutions. We compare the learned solutions with those obtained by systematic search in a simple case study in which pairs of agents have to collaborate in order to solve the task without any explicit communication. The results show that policies which allow teammates to specialize find an adequate diversity of the team and, in general, achieve similar or better performances than policies which force homogeneity. However, in this specific case study, the achieved team performances appear to be independent of the locality or globality of the reinforcement signal.",,第2页.xls
411,Balanced Team Formation for Tasks with Deadlines,2015,"A balanced team formation method is described for tasks with deadlines in multi-agent systems. With the advances that have been made in computer and network technologies, tasks that are achieved by multiple software/hardware entities are often required in many real-world applications. In addition, these tasks are usually required to be done by specified deadlines to avoid a failure of services or to provide quality services in a timely manner. We designed a method for effective team formation for cooperative work of different entities, called agents, to execute tasks having deadlines. The feature of our method is that rational agents autonomously learn which team they should join and which agents they should work with in order to improve the received rewards. Agents using the method also tried to select teams consisting of agents comparable with themselves; this can help them avoid binding to their teams unnecessarily. Another feature is that they estimate the duration of task execution to avoid a failure of tasks due to a violation of time requirements. We experimentally show that these three functions mutually affect each other positively and can achieve quite good performance in real-time environments.",,第2页.xls

Modeling the researchers as individual agents, we simulate our new management structure against a more traditional organization where the researchers are broken into departments based on their skills and assigned projects by management. Our results, measuring the amount of time it takes a research organization to serve a given number of contracts, show promise in the less hierarchical approach.",,第2页.xls
413,Comparative Evaluation of Multiagent Learning Algorithms in a Diverse Set of Ad Hoc Team Problems [arXiv],2019,"This paper is concerned with evaluating different multiagent learning (MAL) algorithms in problems where individual agents may be heterogenous, in the sense of utilizing different learning strategies, without the opportunity for prior agreements or information regarding coordination. Such a situation arises in ad hoc team problems, a model of many practical multiagent systems applications. Prior work in multiagent learning has often been focussed on homogeneous groups of agents, meaning that all agents were identical and a priori aware of this fact. Also, those algorithms that are specifically designed for ad hoc team problems are typically evaluated in teams of agents with fixed behaviours, as opposed to agents which are adapting their behaviours. In this work, we empirically evaluate five MAL algorithms, representing major approaches to multiagent learning but originally developed with the homogeneous setting in mind, to understand their behaviour in a set of ad hoc team problems. All teams consist of agents which are continuously adapting their behaviours. The algorithms are evaluated with respect to a comprehensive characterisation of repeated matrix games, using performance criteria that include considerations such as attainment of equilibrium, social welfare and fairness. Our main conclusion is that there is no clear winner. However, the comparative evaluation also highlights the relative strengths of different algorithms with respect to the type of performance criteria, e.g., social welfare vs. attainment of equilibrium.",,第2页.xls
414,Introduction to spatially distributed intelligent assistant agents for coordination of human-agent teams' actions,2011,"Earthquake emergency response requires different number of teams to cooperate with each other and coordinate their activities to achieve global objectives. Coordination is the key challenging problem that field teams face in urban search and rescue (USAR) emergency response because of the geographic and uncertain environment. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize coordination of teams by allocating tasks to teams in time and space efficiently and sufficiently. The present paper aims to propose an efficient approach that allows humans to collaborate with coordinator assistant agents to assign tasks to teams. To achieve this purpose, we did the following stages: (1) the structure of the USAR task force and environment characteristics were analyzed, (2) we analyzed the spatial coordination problem and then modeled it, (3) features and properties of required approach were assessed, (4) we designed a contract net based model for distributed spatial task allocation and proposed the architecture of spatially distributed intelligent assistant agents (SpDI2A), and (5) finally, our approach was implemented and validated in a geospatial simulation which was developed using AnyLogic software and Java programming. The final result composes of 10 features satisfying the features of the required system.",,第2页.xls
415,Context-centric needs anticipation using information needs graphs,2006,"Effective agent teamwork requires information exchange to be conducted in a proactive, selective, and intelligent way. In the field of distributed artificial intelligence, there has been increasing number of research focusing on need-driven proactive communication, both theoretically and practically. Among these works, CAST has realized a team-oriented agent architecture where agents, based on a computational shared mental model, are able to anticipate teammates' information needs and proactively deliver relevant information to the needers in a timely manner. However, the first implementation of CAST takes little consideration of the dynamics of the anticipated information needs, which can change in various ways as the context develops. In this paper we describe a novel mechanism for organizing and managing the context of information needs. This allows agents to dynamically activate and deactivate information needs progressively. It has been shown that the two-level context-centric approach can enhance team performance considerably.",,第2页.xls
416,The group mind of hybrid teams with humans and intelligent agents in knowledge-intense work,2024,"Studies regularly demonstrate how well intelligent agents (IAs) can support humans or are demonstrably superior to them in some areas. Given that some tasks likely remain unsuitable for even the most intelligent machines in the mid-future, work in hybrid teams of humans and IAs-where the capabilities of both are effectively combined-will most likely shape the way we work in the coming decades. In an abductive study, we investigate an early example of hybrid teams, consisting of a conversational intelligent agent (IA) and humans, that aims to improve health behavior or change personality traits. We theorize Transactive Intelligent Memory System (TIMS) as a new vision of collaboration between humans and IAs in hybrid teams, based on our empirical insights and our literature review on transactive memory systems theory. Our empirical evidence shows that IAs can develop a form of individual and external memory, and hybrid teams of humans and IAs can realize joint systems of transactive memory-a competence that current literature only ascribes to humans. We further find that whether individuals view IAs merely as external memory aids or as part of their teams' transactive memory is moderated by the tasks' complexity and knowledge intensity, as well as the IA's ability to complete the task. This theorizing helps to better understand the role of IAs in future team-based working processes. Developers of IAs can use TIMS as a tool for requirements formulation to prepare their software agents for collaboration in hybrid teams.",,第2页.xls
417,Automatic generation of distributed team formation algorithms from organizational models,2009,"Software systems are subject to ever increasing complexity and in need of efficient structuring. The concept of organization as an expressive and abstract real-world reference presents a promising starting point. Organizational concepts have particularly been studied within the multi-agent systems community. However, there exists a conceptual gap between organizational specifications and their multi-agent implementation. We address this problem by presenting an integrated approach to formalize organizational models with Petri nets and to directly deploy these specifications in a multi-agent system. The operational semantics of Petri nets establishes a close link between organizational specification and deployment that eases system development and maintenance. As an important example, we are able to describe the formation of multi-agent teams in an organizational scenario in terms of Petri net dynamics.",,第2页.xls

PostNL, the biggest parcel and E-commerce corporation of the Netherlands wants to use generative AI to enhance the communication around track and trace of parcels. During the internship a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is created to showcase the value of using generative AI technologies, to enhance parcel tracking, analyzing the parcel's journey and being able to communicate about it in an easy to understand manner. The primary goal was to develop an in-house LLM-based system, reducing dependency on external platforms and establishing the feasibility of a dedicated generative AI team within the company. This multi-agent LLM based system aimed to construct parcel journey stories and identify logistical disruptions with heightened efficiency and accuracy. The research involved deploying a sophisticated AI-driven communication system, employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced response precision, and optimizing large language models (LLMs) tailored to domain specific tasks. The MVP successfully implemented a multi-agent open-source LLM system, called SuperTracy. SuperTracy is capable of autonomously managing a broad spectrum of user inquiries and improving internal knowledge handling. Results and evaluation demonstrated technological innovation and feasibility, notably in communication about the track and trace of a parcel, which exceeded initial expectations.

As each agent employ's a different machine learning technique, the system consists of multiple knowledge sources and their respective heterogeneous knowledge representations. Collaboration between agents involves sharing knowledge to both speed up team learning, as well as refine the team's overall performance and group behavior. Experiments have been performed that vary the learn composition in terms of machine learning algorithms. learning strategies employed by the agents, and sharing frequency for a predator-prey cooperative pursuit task. For lifelong learning heterogenous learning teams were more successful than homogenous learning counterparts. Interestingly, sharing increased the learning rate, but sharing with higher frequency showed diminishing results. Lastly. knowledge conflicts are reduced over time the more sharing takes place. These results support further investigation of the merits of heterogenous learning. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.",,第2页.xls

426,AI-Driven Patient Monitoring with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning [arXiv],2023,"Effective patient monitoring is vital for timely interventions and improved healthcare outcomes. Traditional monitoring systems often struggle to handle complex, dynamic environments with fluctuating vital signs, leading to delays in identifying critical conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel AI-driven patient monitoring framework using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach deploys multiple learning agents, each dedicated to monitoring a specific physiological feature, such as heart rate, respiration, and temperature. These agents interact with a generic healthcare monitoring environment, learn the patients' behavior patterns, and make informed decisions to alert the corresponding Medical Emergency Teams (METs) based on the level of emergency estimated. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-agent DRL framework using real-world physiological and motion data from two datasets: PPG-DaLiA and WESAD. We compare the results with several baseline models, including Q-Learning, PPO, Actor-Critic, Double DQN, and DDPG, as well as monitoring frameworks like WISEML and CA-MAQL. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRL approach outperforms all other baseline models, achieving more accurate monitoring of patient's vital signs. Furthermore, we conduct hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the learning process of each agent. By optimizing hyperparameters, we enhance the learning rate and discount factor, thereby improving the agents' overall performance in monitoring patient health status. Our AI-driven patient monitoring system offers several advantages over traditional methods, including the ability to handle complex and uncertain environments, adapt to varying patient conditions, and make real-time decisions without external supervision.",,第2页.xls

429,Intelligent information fusion approach in cooperative multiagent systems,2002,"Benefits of, and needs for, developing multiagent systems could be easily noticed in solving problems that are unfeasibly solved by any individual agent. Such systems are expected to exempt intelligent collaboration and coordination behaviour. The challenge of having a fully cooperative agent society relies mainly on deriving a consensus decisions made by these autonomous, and goal directed entities. In many cases, these decisions encompass uncertainties caused by different design and environment factors. Thus, aggregating agents' decisions with respect to their uncertainty factors is deemed to be the key to attain reliable delivery performance. In this article we present the use of an intelligent approach, the team consensus approach, to model the interaction and to bring team into a consensus. Agents engage in an uncertainty estimation stage whenever a group decision is required. This process allows each agent to assess its self-uncertainty and the conditional uncertainties of other agents. The process facilitates the computation of a weighting scheme that operates recursively on information collected by these agents until the group reaches a consensus. Whenever a new task is received, the uncertainty estimates of agents are updated and used to compute a new weighting scheme.",,第2页.xls

In order to enhance the already implemented 3D game functions, a pedagogical agent that supports students during the game learning process was implemented. The evaluation approach attempts to investigate the impact of PAs in 3D collaborative educational games focusing on two dimensions: a) on PAs usefulness in collaborative 3D games and b) on students' teams performance in the game learning process. This research concludes that the intervention of pedagogical agent's assistance in the game has a strong positive impact on teams performance and can be considered as useful in collaborative serious games.",,第2页.xls

433,Towards Adaptive Networks - Generalized utility functions in Multi-Agent Frameworks,2024,"Autonomous management of multiple services is a crucial requirement of 6G networks. In recent years, researchers have been working on using artificial intelligence(AI) to orchestrate intents, autonomously, through Intent Management Functions (IMFs). These IMFs can handle conflicting service intents and prioritize the global objective based on predefined utility function and intent priorities. However, for such frameworks to be successful in real-life scenarios, they must be flexible to business situations. Service priorities can change, and the utility function that measures the fulfillment of objectives may also vary in definition. This paper proposes a novel method that enables the IMF to adapt to unseen forms of utility functions and changes in service priorities at run-time without requiring additional training. We assume the IMF contains agents trained using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to perform actions and multiple such MARL systems are orchestrated by Ad-hoc teaming approaches. Results on a network emulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods that require additional training to achieve the same flexibility, thereby saving costs and increasing adaptability.",,第2页.xls
434,Self-organizing team formation for target observation,2001,"Target observation is a problem where the application of multiple sensors can improve the probability of detection and observation of the target. Team formation is one method by which seemingly unsophisticated heterogeneous sensors may be organized to achieve a coordinated observation system. The sensors, which we shall refer to as agents, are situated in an area of interest with the goal of observing a moving target. We apply a team approach to this problem, which combines the strengths of individual agents into a cohesive entity - the team. In autonomous systems, the mechanisms that underlie the formation of a team are of interest. Teams may be formed by various mechanisms, which include an externally imposed grouping of agents, or an internally, self-organized (SO) grouping of agents. Internally motivated mechanisms are particularly challenging, but offer the benefit of being unsupervised, an important quality for groups of autonomous cooperating machines. This is the focus of our research. By studying natural systems such as colonies of ants, we obtain insight into these mechanisms of self-organization. We propose that the team is an expression of a distributed agent-self, and that a particular realization of the agent-self exists, whilst the environmental conditions are conducive to that existence. We describe an algorithm for agent team formation that is inspired by the self-organizing behaviour of ants, and describe simulation results for team formation amongst a lattice of networked sensors.",,第2页.xls

An incremental transaction-based protocol is introduced where agents establish links by buying and selling from each other. Market transactions equate to agents coordinating their plans and sharing their resources to meet the global objective.

Automating the negotiations underlying coalition formation is, naturally, of special concern. However, research to date in both AI and economics has largely ignored the potential presence of uncertainty in coalitional bargaining. We present a model of discounted coalitional bargaining where agents are uncertain about the types (or capabilities) of potential partners, and hence the value of a coalition. We cast the problem as a Bayesian game in extensive form, and describe its Perfect Bayesian Equilibria as the solutions to a polynomial program. We then present a heuristic algorithm using iterative coalition formation to approximate the optimal solution, and evaluate its performance.",,第2页.xls

440,Multiagent Bidirectionally-Coordinated Nets for Learning to Play StarCraft Combat Games [arXiv],2017,"Real-world artificial intelligence (AI) applications often require multiple agents to work in a collaborative effort. Efficient learning for intra-agent communication and coordination is an indispensable step towards general AI. In this paper, we take StarCraft combat game as the test scenario, where the task is to coordinate multiple agents as a team to defeat their enemies. To maintain a scalable yet effective communication protocol, we introduce a multiagent bidirectionally-coordinated network (BiCNet ['bIknet]) with a vectorised extension of actor-critic formulation. We show that BiCNet can handle different types of combats under diverse terrains with arbitrary numbers of AI agents for both sides. Our analysis demonstrates that without any supervisions such as human demonstrations or labelled data, BiCNet could learn various types of coordination strategies that is similar to these of experienced game players. Moreover, BiCNet is easily adaptable to the tasks with heterogeneous agents. In our experiments, we evaluate our approach against multiple baselines under different scenarios; it shows state-of-the-art performance, and possesses potential values for large-scale real-world applications.",,第2页.xls

443,Automated assistants for analyzing team behaviors,2004,"Multi-agent teamwork is critical in a large number of agent applications, including training, education, virtual enterprises and collective robotics. The complex interactions of agents in a team as well as with other agents make it extremely difficult for human developers to understand and analyze agent-teambehavior. It has thus become increasingly important to develop tools that can help humans analyze, evaluate, and understand team behaviors. However, the problem of automated team analysis is largely unaddressed in previous work. In this article, we identify several key constraints faced by team analysts. Most fundamentally, multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. In addition, effective ways of presenting the analysis to humans is critical and the presentation techniques depend on the model being presented. Finally, analysis should be independent of underlying team architecture and implementation.We also demonstrate an approach to addressing these constraints by building an automated team analyst called ISAAC for post-hoc, off-line agent-team analysis. ISAAC acquires multiple, heterogeneous team models via machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC employs multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. ISAAC also provides feedback on team improvement in two novel ways: (i) It supports principled what-if'' reasoning about possible agent improvements; (ii) It allows the user to compare different teams based on their patterns of interactions. This paper presents ISAAC's general conceptual framework, motivating its design, as well as its concrete application in two domains: ( i) RoboCup Soccer; ( ii) software agent teams participating in a simulated evacuation scenario. In the RoboCup domain, ISAAC was used prior to and during the RoboCup '99 tournament, and was awarded the RoboCup Scientific Challenge Award. In the evacuation domain, ISAAC was used to analyze patterns of message exchanges among software agents, illustrating the generality of ISAAC's techniques.

445,Requester vs. Helper-Initiated Protocols for Mutual Assistance in Agent Teamwork,2013,"The Mutual Assistance Protocol (MAP) enables members of an agent team to directly help each other whenever they jointly determine, through a bilateral distributed agreement, that such help is beneficial to the team. Its purpose is to improve the team's performance without affecting its existing organization. In this paper we define and investigate two versions of this generic protocol: the Requester-Initiated Action MAP, which enables team members to proactively seek help, and the Helper-Initiated Action MAP, which enables them to proactively offer help. In both cases, the help consists in performing an action on behalf of a teammate. We introduce the notions of individual wellbeing, that helps an agent decide when to seek or offer help, and proximity bias, that favors assistance to agents which are close to an achievement for the team. Simulation experiments show that these design refinements result in team performance gains over the original version of Action MAP, as we vary the amount of agents' initial resources, dynamic disturbance in the environment, and communication costs. The results confirm the superior performance of teams with Action MAP protocols over teams without help mechanisms. The analysis shows that the relative strengths of the two protocols are complementary. This motivates research interest in protocols that allow proactive behavior of team members in both seeking and offering help.",,第2页.xls

448,Token Based Resource Sharing in Heterogeneous Multi-agent Teams,2009,"In a cooperative heterogeneous multiagent team, distributed agents are required to harmonize activities and make the best use of resources to achieve their common goal. Agents are required to share their resource with very a few of the teammates who need it but with a limited view of the team, they do not know who they are. In this paper, we put forward our resource sharing algorithm for a large heterogeneous team. It does not require a Complete view Or the team or depend on excessive communication. Agents only make use of the knowledge from allocating tasks or sharing the other resources. The key is that we use influence diagram to model how agents may predict what the other agents are doing from their limited information received. By utilizing the relevances between tasks and resources or pairs of resources: We have setup a local probability model so that agents can reason in the uncertainty awl can efficiently share the resource within a few hops to its target. Based on this model; we have two additional designs of dynamic threshold and local decision exchange model so that agents can enhance their local decisions and greatly increase the resource sharing performance. Our experiment results show this system design is feasible for resource sharing in a large heterogeneous multiagent team.",,第2页.xls
449,A future framework for interfacing BDI agents in a real-time teaming oF environment,2006,"Research and applications in human-machine teaming continue to evolve the role of the human from immediate (manual) operator into supervisory and televisory controller. In the supervisory control role, the human operator will be functionally removed from the system under control and in the televisory role, the human operator will be physically removed. Although unmanned systems and vehicles have become a technical reality that drives this change, they will not eliminate the importance of the human operator as the commanding and controlling element in-the-loop. This paper will argue that existing automation concepts remain equally valid with an even greater emphasis on the need for a human-centered automation approach. Intelligent agent technology has become mature and attractive enough to implement the automated components of the human-machine team. Agents that implement the Beliefs-Desire-Intention syntax will be discussed as being of particular interest for human-machine teaming applications. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for teaming human and intelligent agents. The teaming framework will be demonstrated in a real-time simulation environment using the commercial game called Unreal Tournament and its existing GameBot extension. The intelligent agents will be implemented based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) syntax and using JACK, a commercial BDI Agent development language. The requirements for follow-on research, such as human-agent teaming, human-agent coordination and agent learning will be highlighted. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第2页.xls

In the approach, self-managed team in virtual enterprise was taken as the example to examine the effect. After an analysis on self-managed team's double-level learning behavior, team members and tasks were both defined as agents. Based on definitions of concepts as the error rates of self-estimation ability, estimation of others' ability and rules of role changing, a multi-agent simulation model was constructed and implemented into MSSSTB system with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. The model was validated on simulation analysis of a practical problem.

The tree hole is the Chinese name for places on the Web where people post secrets. It provides the possibility of using Artificial Intelligence and big data technology to detect the posts where someone express the suicidal signal from those tree hole social media.

458,Efficient Task Allocation with Communication Delay Based on Reciprocal Teams,2018,"This paper proposes a method to efficiently allocate tasks to appropriate agents by forming teams based on the reciprocity in distributed environments where communication delay is not ignorable. Recent applications on a variety of devices such as PCs, tablets, and smartphones run in different locations to provide location-oriented and time-constrained services. These services are usually realized by agents on these devices communicating with single or multiple service agents operating on servers that are also deployed at multiple points. Because timely response is a key factor for quality of services, communication delay is significant in these applications. Thus, we propose a method in which agents allocate tasks in such a widely distributed environment to reduce the delay of response to the requested tasks by extending our previous work. Then, we experimentally show that our method could improve the overall performance by identifying which agents have high-throughput of task execution from the local viewpoint.",,第2页.xls

The Multi-Agent Planning problems (MAP) contains collective (several agents are performing different actions at the same time such that the combined effect achieves a common goal) and joint actions (a kind of collective action where several agents are performing the same action at the same time such that the combined effect achieves a common goal) makes the planning a bit challenging. The execution of such actions demand team formation prior to their execution. The plan execution, involving team formation of the size that is not known a priori is very hard and challenging. The key contributions of the paper include: (1) identification of the domain where the number of agents required to finish a job is not known a prior, (2) proposing a distributed consensus algorithm based on asynchronous communication (messages passing) to form a team and (3) The design specification and validation of the proposed algorithm with Specification and Descriptive Language (SDL) and Message Sequence Charts (MSCs).",,第2页.xls
463,Application of free energy minimization to the design of adaptive multi-agent teams,2017,"Many novel DoD missions, from disaster relief to cyber reconnaissance, require teams of humans and machines with diverse capabilities. Current solutions do not account for heterogeneity of agent capabilities, uncertainty of team knowledge, and dynamics of and dependencies between tasks and agent roles, resulting in brittle teams. Most importantly, the state-of-the-art team design solutions are either centralized, imposing role and relation assignment onto agents, or completely distributed, suitable for only homogeneous organizations such as swarms. Centralized design models can't provide insights for team's self-organization, i.e. adapting team structure over time in distributed collaborative manner by team members with diverse expertise and responsibilities.In this paper we present an information-theoretic formalization of team composition and structure adaptation using a minimization of variational free energy. The structure adaptation is obtained in an iterative distributed and collaborative manner without the need for centralized control. We show that our model is lightweight, predictive, and produces team structures that theoretically approximate an optimal policy for team adaptation. Our model also provides a unique coupling between the structure and action policy, and captures three essential processes of learning, perception, and control.",,第2页.xls

The algorithm may be hybrid or applied in parallel. Contrary to traditional approaches, this paper proposes to form teams of algorithms to tackle global optimization problems. Each algorithm is embodied and ran by a software agent. Agents exist in a multiagent system and communicate over Our proposed MultiAgent ENvironment for Global Optimization (MANGO). Through Communication and cooperation, the agents complement each other in tasks that they cannot do on their own. This paper gives a formal description of MANGO and Outlines design principles for developing agents to execute Oil MANGO.

466,You Know What I'm Saying: Designing Conversational Strategies of AI Agent for Tip of the Tongue Phenomenon,2023,"The phenomenon of being unable to recall a specific word or term from memory is called tip-of-the-tongue (TOT). Despite its significance, potential applications for solving TOT from the user experience (UX) and human-computer interface (HCI) perspectives are yet to be fully explored. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) interfaces and technologies, new opportunities have emerged to address TOT. This study aims to investigate the applicability of AI in addressing TOT and the roles of conversation design strategies in mitigating this phenomenon. To this end, we developed a prototype called Tip-pong, which is a turn-taking user interface that provides semantic and episodic clues, as well as targeted and optional answers to assist users in resolving TOT. Through a quantitative and qualitative study involving 23 participants, we evaluated the prototype and found that while the type of clue had no significant impact on usability, users preferred optional answers over targeted answers. Additionally, we found that allowing users to experience the process of approaching the answer on their own was more effective than providing the correct answer immediately. Based on these findings, we discuss the design implications for the development of AI agents to solve TOT in everyday life.",,第2页.xls

468,Mixed-Initiative Human-Robot Teaming under Suboptimality with Online Bayesian Adaptation,2024,"For effective human-agent teaming, robots and other artificial intelligence (AI) agents must infer their human partner's abilities and behavioral response patterns and adapt accordingly. Most prior works make the unrealistic assumption that one or more teammates can act near-optimally. In real-world collaboration, humans and autonomous agents can be suboptimal, especially when each only has partial domain knowledge. In this work, we develop computational modeling and optimization techniques for enhancing the performance of suboptimal human-agent teams, where the human and the agent have asymmetric capabilities and act suboptimally due to incomplete environmental knowledge. We adopt an online Bayesian approach that enables a robot to infer people's willingness to comply with its assistance in a sequential decision-making game. Our user studies show that user preferences and team performance indeed vary with robot intervention styles, and our approach for mixed-initiative collaborations enhances objective team performance ($p<.001$) and subjective measures, such as user's trust ($p<.001$) and perceived likeability of the robot ($p<.001$).",,第2页.xls

470,A multilateral negotiation method for software process modeling,2007,"Currently most software process modeling approaches are predefined, not automatically adaptive to different software projects, and provide little support for development team formation with task and resources allocation in real environments. Based on our ten-year working experience for software organizations, we propose an agent-based multilateral negotiation model MNM-PA to support dynamic software process modelling and ease the work of team formation. MNM-PA brings the following advantages: (1) the software processes are not predefined; (2) the software processes are for given projects and with development teams, allocated tasks and task constrains. MNM-PA is an extension of the classic one-time biding contract net protocol. It defines the main components to model a complete negotiation process for software process construction, especially including the negotiation strategies. MNM-PA is implemented and experimented in a software process management tool namely SoftPM, which is used in more than 100 software organizations in China.",,第2页.xls

472,Classification of Military Occupational Specialty Codes for Agent Learning in Human-Agent Teams,2019,"With the exponential growth of technology, future military operations will be comprised of not just ground operations but a multi-domain battlespace. Paramount to mission success will be the reliance on intelligent adaptive computational agents and effective human-agent teaming. An agent teammate can assist the Soldier with tasks that may be seen as physically difficult, cognitively fatiguing, or high risk. However, successful teaming is compromised when an agent lacks the attributes that contribute to effective human-human collaboration, such as knowledge about team-members' work preferences or capabilities. One way to provide agents with a sense of team-member preferences or capabilities is to quantitatively characterize such preferences as a function of the job the human intends to perform. To address this, we analyzed a modified survey from the Army Research Institute that is commonly used to identify work-abilities variables in military personnel based on the service member's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). Using machine learning techniques, statistical comparisons are made in order to quantitatively assess population-averaged responses that Soldiers from various MOS codes provided on an Army Abilities questionnaire. Similarities and differences across groupings of MOS codes can provide a set of observations that might be parametrized into a computational agent's framework. The goal of this work is to identify MOS code related parameters that might be incorporated into a computational agent's framework in the future development of flexibly adaptive agents for Soldier-agent teams.",,第2页.xls

We describe CMUnited, the team of small robotic agents that we developed to enter the RoboCup-97 competition. We designed and built the robotic agents, devised the appropriate vision algorithm, and developed and implemented algorithms for strategic collaboration between the robots in an uncertain and dynamic environment. The robots can organize themselves in formations, hold specific roles, and pursue their goals. In game situations, they have demonstrated their collaborative behaviors on multiple occasions.

474,"More Similar Values, More Trust? -- the Effect of Value Similarity on Trust in Human-Agent Interaction [arXiv]",2021,"As AI systems are increasingly involved in decision making, it also becomes important that they elicit appropriate levels of trust from their users. To achieve this, it is first important to understand which factors influence trust in AI. We identify that a research gap exists regarding the role of personal values in trust in AI. Therefore, this paper studies how human and agent Value Similarity (VS) influences a human's trust in that agent. To explore this, 89 participants teamed up with five different agents, which were designed with varying levels of value similarity to that of the participants. In a within-subjects, scenario-based experiment, agents gave suggestions on what to do when entering the building to save a hostage. We analyzed the agent's scores on subjective value similarity, trust and qualitative data from open-ended questions. Our results show that agents rated as having more similar values also scored higher on trust, indicating a positive effect between the two. With this result, we add to the existing understanding of human-agent trust by providing insight into the role of value-similarity. [S Mehrotra, C. M. Jonker, and M. L. Tielman.

475,KABOOM: an agent-based model for simulating cognitive style in team problem solving,2019,"The performance of a design team is influenced by each team members unique cognitive style - i.e., their preferred manner of managing structure as they solve problems, make decisions, and seek to bring about change. Cognitive style plays an important role in how teams of engineers design and collaborate, but the interactions of cognitive style with team organization and processes have not been well studied. The limitations of small-scale behavioral experiments have led researchers to develop computational models for simulating teamwork; however, none have modeled the effects of individuals cognitive styles. This paper presents the Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory agentbased organizational optimization model (KABOOM), the first agent-based model of teamwork to incorporate cognitive style. In KABOOM, heterogeneous agents imitate the diverse problem-solving styles described by the Kirton Adaption-Innovation construct, which places each individual somewhere along the spectrum of cognitive style preference. Using the model, we investigate the interacting effects of a teams communication patterns, specialization, and cognitive style composition on design performance. By simulating cognitive style in the context of team problem solving, KABOOM lays the groundwork for the development of team simulations that reflect humans diverse problem-solving styles.",,第2页.xls

A robot is an integrated system, with a controller embedded in its plant. A robotic system is the coupling of a robot to its environment. Robotic systems are, in general, hybrid dynamic systems, consisting of continuous, discrete and event-driven components. Constraint Nets provide a semantic model for modeling hybrid dynamic systems. Controllers are embedded constraint solvers that solve constraints in real-time.

477,Using Speech Agents for Mood Logging within Blended Mental Healthcare: Mental Healthcare Practitioners' Perspectives,2024,"Mood logging, where people track mood-related data, is commonly used to support mental healthcare. Speech agents could prove benefcial in supporting mood logging for clients. Yet we know little about how Mental Healthcare Practitioners (MHPs) view speech as a tool to support current care practices. Through a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 15 MHPs, we show that MHPs see opportunities in the convenience, and the data richness that speech agents could aford. However, MHPs also saw this richness as noisy, with using speech potentially diminishing a client's focus on mood logging as an activity. MHPs were wary of overusing AI-based tools, expressing concerns around data ownership, access and privacy.

479,Neural Payoff Machines: Predicting Fair and Stable Payoff Allocations Among Team Members,2022,"In many multi-agent settings, participants can form teams to achieve collective outcomes that may far surpass their individual capabilities. Measuring the relative contributions of agents and allocating them shares of the reward that promote long-lasting cooperation are difficult tasks. Cooperative game theory offers solution concepts identifying distribution schemes, such as the Shapley value, that fairly reflect the contribution of individuals to the performance of the team or the Core, which reduces the incentive of agents to abandon their team. Applications of such methods include identifying influential features and sharing the costs of joint ventures or team formation. Unfortunately, using these solutions requires tackling a computational barrier as they are hard to compute, even in restricted settings. In this work, we show how cooperative game-theoretic solutions can be distilled into a learned model by training neural networks to propose fair and stable payoff allocations. We show that our approach creates models that can generalize to games far from the training distribution and can predict solutions for more players than observed during training. An important application of our framework is Explainable AI: our approach can be used to speed-up Shapley value computations on many instances.",,第2页.xls

481,Artificial Intelligence Versus Human-Controlled Doctor in Virtual Reality Simulation for Sepsis Team Training: Randomized Controlled Study,2023,"Background: Interprofessional communication is needed to enhance the early recognition and management of patients with sepsis. Preparing medical and nursing students using virtual reality simulation has been shown to be an effective learning approach for sepsis team training. However, its scalability is constrained by unequal cohort sizes between medical and nursing students. An artificial intelligence (AI) medical team member can be implemented in a virtual reality simulation to engage nursing students in sepsis team training.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an AI-powered doctor versus a human-controlled doctor in training nursing students for sepsis care and interprofessional communication.Methods: A randomized controlled trial study was conducted with 64 nursing students who were randomly assigned to undertake sepsis team training with an AI-powered doctor (AI-powered group) or with medical students using virtual reality simulation (human-controlled group). Participants from both groups were tested on their sepsis and communication performance through simulation-based assessments (posttest). Participants' sepsis knowledge and self-efficacy in interprofessional communication were also evaluated before and after the study interventions.Results: A total of 32 nursing students from each group completed the simulation-based assessment, sepsis and communication knowledge test, and self-efficacy questionnaire. Compared with the baseline scores, both the AI-powered and human-controlled groups demonstrated significant improvements in communication knowledge (P=.001) and self-efficacy in interprofessional communication (P<.001) in posttest scores. For sepsis care knowledge, a significant improvement in sepsis care knowledge from the baseline was observed in the AI-powered group (P<.001) but not in the human-controlled group (P=.16). Although no significant differences were found in sepsis care performance between the groups (AI-powered group: mean 13.63, SD 4.23, vs human-controlled group: mean 12.75, SD 3.85, P=.39), the AI-powered group (mean 9.06, SD 1.78) had statistically significantly higher sepsis posttest knowledge scores (P=.009) than the human-controlled group (mean 7.75, SD 2.08). No significant differences were found in interprofessional communication performance between the 2 groups (AI-powered group: mean 29.34, SD 8.37, vs human-controlled group: mean 27.06, SD 5.69, P=.21). However, the human-controlled group (mean 69.6, SD 14.4) reported a significantly higher level of self-efficacy in interprofessional communication (P=.008) than the AI-powered group (mean 60.1, SD 13.3).Conclusions: Our study suggested that AI-powered doctors are not inferior to human-controlled virtual reality simulations with respect to sepsis care and interprofessional communication performance, which supports the viability of implementing AI-powered doctors to achieve scalability in sepsis team training. Our findings also suggested that future innovations should focus on the sociability of AI-powered doctors to enhance users' interprofessional communication training. Perhaps in the nearer term, future studies should examine how to best blend AI-powered training with human-controlled virtual reality simulation to optimize clinical performance in sepsis care and interprofessional communication.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05953441; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05953441",,第2页.xls

484,The quest for appropriate models of human-likeness: anthropomorphism in media equation research,2018,"Nass and Reeves media equation paradigm within human-computer interaction (HCI) challenges long-held assumptions about how users approach computers. Given a rudimentary set of cues present in the systems design, users are said to unconsciously treat computers as genuine interactantsextending rules of politeness, biases and human interactive conventions to machines. Since the results have wide-ranging implications for HCI research methods, interface design and user experiences, researchers are hard-pressed to experimentally verify the paradigm. This paper focuses on the methodology of attributing the necessary social cues to the agent, a core aspect of the experimental design of studies dealing with the media equation. A typology of experimental anthropomorphisms is developed, allowing an assessment of how the differing axiomatic assumptions affect the relevance of the results for an evaluation of the paradigm.

In many cases, previous multi-agent systems either assumed the availability of existing communication infrastructure or were required to create a network in addition to completing their objective. Instead our system explicitly assumes the responsibility of creating and sustaining a wireless network capable of satisfying end-to-end communication requirements of a team of agents, called the task team, performing an arbitrary objective. To accomplish this goal, we propose a joint optimization framework that alternates between finding optimal network routes to support data flows between the task agents and improving the performance of the network by repositioning a collection of mobile relay nodes referred to as the network team.

490,Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) interactively working with humans as a junior cyber analyst,2021,"There are many applications where artificial intelligence (AI) can add a benefit, but this benefit may not be fully realized, if the human cannot understand and interact with the output as required by their context. Allowing AI to explain its decisions can potentially mitigate this issue. To develop effective explainable AI methods to support this need, we need to understand both what the human needs for decision-making, as well as what information the AI has and can make available. This paper presents an example case of capturing those requirements. We explore how an operational planner (senior human analyst) for a cyber protection team could use a junior analyst virtual agent to scour, analyze, and present the data available on vulnerabilities and incidents on both the target systems as well as similar systems. We explore the interactions required to understand these outputs and to integrate additional knowledge held by the human. This is an exemplar case for integrating XAI into the real-world bi-directional workflow: the senior analyst needs to be able to understand the junior analysts results, particularly the assumptions and implications, in order to create a plan and brief it up the command chain. He or she may have further questions, or analysis needs to achieve this understanding.

We have pursued this work in the context of robotic soccer both in simulation and with real physical robots. We briefly present these two frameworks emphasizing their different technical challenges. Creating effective members of a team is a challenging research problem. We first address this issue by introducing a team architecture organization which allows for a rich task decomposition between team members. The main contribution of this paper is our introduction of an action-selection algorithm that allows for a teammate to anticipate the needs of other teammates. Anticipation is critical for maximizing the probability of successful collaboration in teams of agents. We show how our contribution applies to the two concrete robotic soccer frameworks and present controlled empirical results run in simulation.

494,Using AI Simulations to Dynamically Model Multi-agent Multi-team Energy Systems,2020,"The complexity of energy systems is well known as they are complex and intricate systems. As a result, many extant studies have used many simplifications or generalizations that do not accurately reflect the nature of this complex system. In particular, most HVAC systems are modeled as a single unit, or several large units, rather than as a hierarchical composite (e.g., as a floor rather than as a collection of disparate rooms). The net result of this is that the simulations are too generic to perform meaningful analysis, machine learning, or integrated simulation. We propose using a multi-agent multi-team strategic simulations framework called SiMAMT to better define, model, simulate, and learn the HVAC environment. SiMAMT allows us to create distinct models for each type of room, hierarchically aggregate them into units (like floors, or sections), and then into larger sets (like buildings or a campus), and then perform a simulation that interacts with each sub-element individually, the teams of sub-elements collectively, and the entire set in aggregation. Further, and most importantly, we additionally model another team within the simulation framework - the users of the systems. Again, each individual is modeled distinctly, aggregated into sub-sets, then collected into large sets. Each user, or agent, is performing on their own but with respect to the larger team goals. This provides a simulation that has a much higher model fidelity and more applicable results that match the real-world.",,第2页.xls

However, existing methods still require expertise and cannot realize the automation of the whole creation process, making it difficult to widely serve the public. This paper proposes the concept and architecture of intelligent art factory, based on advanced foundation models and AI agent systems. Creative production oriented agents and digital teams, in conjunction with the basic workflow, functions, and methods of the intelligent art factory are established. The creative process automation and creative knowledge automation are achieved through collaboration among biological humans, digital humans, and robots in cyber-physical-social spaces.

RL may profit significantly from world models (WMs) estimating state transition probabilities and rewards. In high-dimensional, continuous input spaces, however, learning accurate WMs is intractable. Here we show that incomplete WMs can help to quickly find good action selection policies. Our approach is based on a novel combination of CMACs and prioritized sweeping-like algorithms. Variants thereof outperform both Q(lambda)-learning with CMACs and the evolutionary method Probabilistic Incremental Program Evolution (PIPE) which performed best in previous comparisons.",,第2页.xls
502,Game-Theoretic and Genetic-Based Approach for Cooperative Mission-Oriented Swarms of Drones,2019,"The artificial intelligence applied to a drone has enabled a drone-swarm to operate autonomously as a group and unlocked many new potential applications that deal with more sophisticated tasks. In this paper, we present a game theory mechanism and nature-inspired algorithm that enable a fully autonomous drone-swarm to perform cooperative mission-oriented operations to some distinct targets. These operations require a small-team formation for each target with the potential overlap team member between teams and multiple task assignment and operations scheduling to ensure the mission success in a timely manner. The drone-swarm is modeled and simulated as a multi-agents system. A fully autonomous drone is represented as an intelligent agent with a certain dynamic risk tolerance level. An agent can decide based on the current risk tolerance level to participate in the auction-based team formation for a specific target while the genetic algorithm approach is used for the task assignment and operations scheduling. A multi-agent system simulator, which can be used to visualize, evaluate, and analyze the proposed team formation, task assignment, and operation schedule; is built using Netlogo, a multi-agent programmable modeling environment. A case study and its simulation results are provided to demonstrate the potential use of the proposed approach.",,第2页.xls

505,GTPOT-RL for multiagent teamwork,2003,"A central issue in the design of cooperative multiagent systems is multiagent teamwork or how to coordinate the behavior of the agents to achieve a team goal. Traditionally, this had been accomplished by hand-coding the coordination strategy. However, this task is complex due to the dynamism of the environment. Recent work in this area has focused on learning multiagent teamwork. This paper introduces a new cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm, namely generalized team-partitioned, opaque-transition reinforcement learning (GTPOT-RL) which builds upon and extends its parent (TPOT-RL). The algorithm is designed for domains in which agents cannot necessarily observe the state changes when other team members act (opaque-transition). The algorithm requires a partitioning of the state space into disjoint regions and an assignment of a role to each agent to achieve a local goal (team-partitioned). The agents then, simultaneously, learn collaborative policies by observing the long-term effects of their actions. By partitioning the state space and distributing the responsibilities among the agents and finally linking their goals, an effective way of cooperation emerges. The effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated and contrasted to TPOT-RL using the standard test bed for multiagent research in the recent years, namely simulated robotic soccer.",,第2页.xls

Having autonomous agents capable of learning its previously unknown teammates preferences and acting in harmony with them to achieve the system's end has been declared as a challenge to the AI. An agent capable of ad hoc teamwork is one that can effectively cooperate with multiple potential teammates on a set of collaborative tasks. This agent has to learn other agents behaviours and preferences in order to be able to predict their actions on some level. This paper presents an empirical study of ad hoc teamwork, taking advantage of Observer System's merits. Specifically, we evaluate a learning mechanism for on-line behaviour generation on the part of a single ad hoc team agent that must collaborate with other unknown teammates in the pursuit domain.",,第2页.xls

This is the third year that the competitors must design a team of herding agents, whose global goal is to lead a maximum number of cows to their own corral. As this is a very complex task and requires coordination of the team, we have developed the individual agents using the Jason (Bordini et al. 2007) interpreter for AgentSpeak(L) (Rao 1996). Moreover, the coordination strategy was defined using the MOISE (+) (Hubner et al. 2002, 2007) organizational model. We have also used the idea of artifact (Ricci et al. 2007) to develop global services, available to all the agents. Moreover, it is clear that for this contest some pure procedural processing should be developed in a lower abstraction level (Hubner et al. 2008); therefore some calculation and pre-defined global decisions were implemented by Java classes.",,第2页.xls

The generic design model formulated covers the entire supply chain, from vendor selection, to production-distribution sites configuration, transportation options and marketing policy choices. The model is based on the mapping of a conceptual supply chain activity graph on potential network locations. To solve this complex design problem, we propose Collaborative Agent Team (CAT), an efficient hybrid metaheuristic based on the concept of asynchronous agent teams (A-Teams).

511,Agent-Based Modeling of Emotion Contagion in Groups,2015,"To avoid the development of negative emotion in their teams, team leaders may benefit from being aware of the emotional dynamics of the team members. To this end, the use of intelligent computer systems that analyze emotional processes within teams is a promising direction. As a first step toward the development of such systems, this paper uses an agent-based approach to formalize and simulate emotion contagion processes within groups, which may involve absorption or amplification of emotions of others. The obtained computational model is analyzed both by explorative simulation and by mathematical analysis. In addition, to illustrate the applicability of the model, it is shown how the model can be integrated within a computational 'ambient agent model' that monitors and predicts group emotion levels over time and proposes group support actions based on that. Based on this description, a discussion is provided of the main contribution of the model, as well as the next steps needed to incorporate it into real-world applications.",,第2页.xls

513,Multiagent-based multi-team formation control for mobile robots,2005,"In the field of formation control, researchers generally control multiple robots in only one team, and little research focuses on multi-team formation control. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called Virtual Operator MultiAgent System (VOMAS), to perform formation control for multiple teams of mobile robots with the capabilities and advantages of scalability and autonomy. VOMAS is a hybrid architecture with two main agents. The virtual operator agent handles high level missions and team control, and the robot agent deals with low level formation control. The virtual operator uses four basic services including join, remove, split, and merge requests to perform multi-team control. A new robot can be easily added to a team by cloning a new virtual operator to control it. The robot agent uses a simple formation representation method to show formation to a large number of robots, and it uses the concept of potential field and behavior-based control to perform kinematic control to keep formation both in holonomic and nonholonomic mobile robots. In addition, we also test the stability, robustness, and uncertainty in the simulation.",,第2页.xls

515,Resilient Continuum Deformation Coordination [arXiv],2019,"This paper applies the principles of continuum mechanics to safely and resiliently coordinate a multi-agent team. A hybrid automation with two operation modes, Homogeneous Deformation Mode (HDM) and Containment Exclusion Mode (CEM), are developed to robustly manage group coordination in the presence of unpredicted agent failures. HDM becomes active when all agents are healthy, where the group coordination is defined by homogeneous transformation coordination functions. By classifying agents as leaders and followers, a desired n-D homogeneous transformation is uniquely related to the desired trajectories of n+1 leaders and acquired by the remaining followers in real-time through local communication. The paper offers a novel approach for leader selection as well as naturally establishing and reestablishing inter-agent communication whenever the agent team enters the HDM. CEM is activated when at least one agent fails to admit group coordination. This paper applies unique features of decentralized homogeneous transformation coordination to quickly detect each arising anomalous situation and excludes failed agent(s) from group coordination of healthy agents. In CEM, agent coordination is treated as an ideal fluid flow where the desired agents' paths are defined along stream lines inspired by fluid flow field theory to circumvent exclusion spaces surrounding failed agent(s).",,第2页.xls

First two teams play in non-cooperative game and find their equilibrium point and payoff then all players in a team tries reaching to this position. As there are several decision about team strategy in non-cooperative game and player strategy in cooperative game, our novel approach to use Fuzzy Integral Operators (F10) to fuse sensory information enables designer to softly change team strategy and play the most likelihood game to a real game.

517,Formation of association structures based on reciprocity and their performance in allocation problems,2016,"We describe the reciprocal agents that build virtual associations in accordance with past cooperative work in a bottom-up manner and that allocate tasks or resources preferentially to agents in the same associations in busy large-scale distributed environments. Models of multi-agent systems (MAS) are often used to express tasks that are done by teams of cooperative agents, so how each subtask is allocated to appropriate agents is a central issue. Particularly in busy environments where multiple tasks are requested simultaneously and continuously, simple allocation methods in self-interested agents result in conflicts, meaning that these methods attempt to allocate multiple tasks to one or a few capable agents. Thus, the systems performance degrades. To avoid such conflicts, we introduce reciprocal agents that cooperate with specific agents that have excellent mutual experience of cooperation. They then autonomously build associations in which they try to form teams for new incoming tasks. We introduce theN-agent team formation (TF) game, an abstract expression of allocating problems in MAS by eliminating unnecessary and complicated task and agent specifications, thereby identifying the fundamental mechanism to facilitate and maintain associations. We experimentally show that reciprocal agents can considerably improve performance by reducing the number of conflicts inN-agent TF games with differentNvalues by establishing association structures. We also investigate how learning parameters to decide reciprocity affect association structures and which structure can achieve efficient allocations.",,第2页.xls

How to select a subset from satellite cluster to perform all observation tasks effectively with low cost is a new challenge arousing in the field of aerospace resource scheduling. This is the agent team formation problem for observation task-oriented satellite cluster. A mathematical scheduling model is built.

519,Designing an Automated Agent to Encourage Human Reliance,2017,"Human reliance on automated agents can be critically important, as exemplified by a pilot relying on an automated ground collision avoidance system. While it is important that the automated agent perform a task well, thus promoting reliance on the automation, it is difficult to test human reliance on automated agents in safety-critical systems. This paper presents an automated agent designed to enable testing of human reliance on automation in theSpace Navigatorenvironment. The automated agent performs collision detection and avoidance tasks in the environment, aiding the human participant in real-time. We present a collision detection and avoidance model, comparing three potential methods for collision avoidance. Analysis shows that the new agents performance when teamed with another simulated agent improves upon previous individual human and human-agent team performances in the same environment, thus making it logical for humans to rely upon it. A human-subjects study confirms that the resulting automated agent/environment pairing enables human reliance studies in a low-states automation environment.",,第2页.xls

524,Asynchronous teams: cooperation schemes for autonomous agents,1998,"Experiments over a variety of optimization problems indicate that scale-effective convergence is an emergent behavior of certain computer based agents, provided these agents are organized into an asynchronous team (A-Team). An A-Team is a problem solving architecture in which the agents are autonomous and cooperate by modifying one another's trial solutions. These solutions circulate continually. Convergence is said to occur if and when a persistent solution appears. Convergence is said to be scale-effective if the quality of the persistent solution increases with the number of agents, and the speed of its appearance increases with the number of computers. The paper uses a traveling salesman problem to illustrate scale-effective behavior and develops Markov models that explain its occurrence in A-Teams, particularly, how autonomous agents, without strategic planning or centralized coordination, can converge to solutions of arbitrarily high quality. The models also predict two properties that remain to be experimentally confirmed: (i) construction and destruction are dual processes, i.e., adept destruction can compensate for inept construction in an A-Team, and vice versa (construction refers to the process of creating or changing solutions, destruction, to the process of erasing solutions); and (ii) solution quality is independent of agent-phylum, i.e., A-Teams provide an organizational framework in which humans and autonomous mechanical agents can cooperate effectively.",,第2页.xls

This paper describes an extension of the ALLIANCE architecture that enables agent recruitment within a decentralized UAV-UGV robot team without task preemption but 1) uses a formal model of emotions and 2) handles heterogeneity. Affective computing allows recruitment to be robust under loss of communication between agents and minimizes the number of messages passed. Data from 66 simulations show that the affective strategy succeeds with a random message loss rate up to 25% and requires 19.1% fewer messages to be sent compared to greedy and random, and that of these, affective scales best with team size.

529,Collaboration of Heterogeneous Agents in Time Constrained Tasks,2016,"Task execution by a coordinated team of robots that feature different skills and competencies, offers certain advantages over a single robot. To better coordinate individual actions, effective planners are necessary to consider the time that agents devote to the completion of partial activities, the different skills that agents may have and the qualitative differences in action implementation by different agents. Multi-agent collaboration in everyday environments assumes the coordination of individual activities in the presence of external disturbances. In this context, incremental approaches seem more appropriate for planning multi-agent collaboration offering increased flexibility against dynamic changes. We propose a new time-informed planning framework for incrementally guiding a team of heterogeneous robots. The proposed approach, takes into account the skills and limitations of individual agents in order to assign them tasks which improve their usability for the team and facilitate the accomplishment of the common goals.",,第2页.xls

In DDM, resources are modeled as cooperative mobile teams of agents and objects or tasks are assumed to be distributed over a virtual space. Each agent has direct access to only local and partial information about its immediate surroundings. DDM organizes teams hierarchically and addresses two important issues that are prerequisites for success in such domains: (i) how agents can extend local, partial information to arrive at a better local assessment of the situation and (ii) how the local assessments from teams of many agents can be integrated to form a global assessment of the situation.

A dandelion graph structure is used for defining agent neighborhood relations and for representing schedules, so as to support the agent flocking framework. The Inter- and Intra-Roam-Space movement algorithms govern the movement of individual agents. Although task information such as due dates and durations can be available for scheduling, in a dynamically changing environment, these values can only be estimated and are often subjected to changes. Therefore, the proposed scheme aims at allowing robot teams to adapt to unforseen circumstances, while at the same time, still making use of available time information for preliminary scheduling and planning. Realistic simulations are performed and verifies the effectiveness of the approach.",,第2页.xls

We consider multiple objectives such as minimizing (weighted) earliness and tardiness, and minimizing job-machine assignment costs. We use an agent-based architecture called Asynchronous Team (A-Team), in which each agent encapsulates a different problem solving strategy and agents cooperate by exchanging results. Computational experiments on large instances of real-world scheduling problems show that the results obtained by this approach are significantly better than any single algorithm or the scheduler alone.

537,A multi-agent system to support location-based group decision making in mobile teams,2004,"In this chapter, an agent-based approach to developing location-based asynchronous group decision support systems is proposed, mPower (a system based on that approach) is introduced, and the way in which the above challenges can be resolved is discussed. The mPower application adopts a multi-agent system (MAS) approach. The MAS is considered a key technology to support distributed teams. Intelligent, autonomous agents can collaborate to provide opportunities to reduce communications costs, combat information overload, and improve response times [1,2]. The mPower system contains agents that interact to support distributed group decision-making processes. Each user of the system is supported by an agent that acts as their personal assistant, tracking their current position and using that information to automate part of the group decision-making process. The personal agent behaves independently of the user, according to a predefined decision-support policy, negotiating with other agents to exchange information as and when necessary. The autonomous characteristics of multi-agent systems are essential to facilitate asynchronous GDSS, as occasionally users cannot contribute in a timely manner to all the decision-making processes in which they are involved.",,第2页.xls

HactarV2 has been implemented in the agent programming language Goal. One of the main challenges of the Agent Contest is to design adecentralizedmulti-agent system that is able to strategically compete with other agent teams. To address this challenge, the strategy of HactarV2 is based on implicit coordination between agents and there is no central manager that keeps track of all information. The aim, moreover, has been to minimize the communication between agents. Communication is used by HactarV2 agents to ensure that each of them maintains the same map of the environment. The Mars scenario of this year required agents to explore, locate and occupy high valued zones on the planet Mars. Because initially agents are randomly placed on the map, in the first phase of the game the agents individually explore the map and update each other. Agents have different roles and we describe the strategies used by individual agents per role. In the second phase of the game, which starts when the agents have located high value nodes on the map, the agents group together and act as a swarm to maintain and possibly expand the zone on the map that is occupied by the agents.",,第2页.xls
541,Decentralized Reactive Adjustment of Agent Teamwork Organization to Changing Environment,2014,"An agent team with differentiated skill profiles of individual members, that performs a task in a dynamic environment which exhibits significant unpredictable changes, may need to adjust its work organization in order to maintain satisfactory performance. The uncertainty of long-term effects of such modifications favors reactive, incremental, and decentralized approaches. This paper explores the idea that such approaches should be based on flexible, dynamic combinations of complementary adjustment strategies. We investigate the effects of several strategies and their combinations on the performance of teamwork in a microworld setting. The strategies are represented by simple abstract models, whose impacts on team performance are studied experimentally using the Agent Interaction Model Simulator (AIMS) framework. The specific strategies include: independent replanning of individual subtasks; direct mutual help among teammates; and bilateral swapping of subtasks in progress among the team members. The results demonstrate that some of the component strategies are more adaptable and valuable than others, but that a well-formed combination regularly outperforms any single method. We also identify and discuss the challenges arising in the design and implementation of combined interaction protocols, formulate an improved version of the Requester-Initiated Action Mutual Assistance Protocol (RIAMAP), and introduce an interaction protocol for subtask swapping.",,第2页.xls
542,Relative performance or team evaluation? Optimal contracts for other-regarding agents,2011,"This paper derives optimal incentive contracts for agents with other-regarding preferences. It offers a behavioral explanation for the empirically observed lack of relative performance evaluation. We analyze a principal-multi agent model and assume that agents are inequity averse or status seeking. We show that team contracts can be optimal even if the agents performance measures are positively correlated such that relative performance evaluation would be optimal with purely self-interested agents and even though relative performance evaluation provides additional incentives to provide effort if agents have other-regarding preferences. Furthermore, optimal incentive contracts for other-regarding agents can be low-powered as compared to contracts for purely self-interested agents. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第2页.xls
543,An agent-based approach to support performance management for dynamic and collaborative work,2007,"This paper describes a comprehensive multiagent based modelling approach for collaborative and dynamic organizational roles support. The method is a role centred one, where agents collaborate to assist human users through collaboration within the same role, with other roles of the same team, as well as roles of different teams that share tasks dependencies. Agents in the system are not restricted by predefined schemes they can join and/or leave the coalition. We identify the key elements of the role model as rules, agents, and relationships. Our role model integrates both the operational functionalities and the performance management towards specific goals, the former involve human individuals in the loop, whereas the later are performed by software agents to assist in monitoring, control, and adaptation of the performance in dynamic organizations.",,第2页.xls

546,Failure Detection and Reactive Teaming for Behavior-Based Subsumption,2011,"Fast, lightweight intelligent controllers make it possible to apply agent-based artificial intelligence to even highly resource-constrained systems. Reactive control methods can provide this capability, and are frequently used in applications such as real-time games and robotics. Unfortunately, reactive controllers may not deal well with errors, as they cannot fall back on a planner to deal with unexpected situations. This limitation makes them more susceptible to certain types of failures than deliberative techniques. In this paper, we describe how four major types of failures can be detected in reactive controllers. We show how this can lead to extensions for behavior-based subsumption which allow more robust single agents, enable inexpensive multi-agent coordination, and improve agent design tools.",,第2页.xls
547,Teammates First: Favoring Ingroup Robots over Outgroup Humans,2017,"When it's between a robot on your team and a human member of a competing team, who will you favor? Past research indicates that people favor and behave more morally toward ingroup than outgroup members. Conversely, people typically indicate that they have more moral responsibilities toward humans than nonhumans. This study puts participants into two competing teams, each consisting of two humans and two robots, to examine how people behave toward others depending on Group (ingroup, outgroup) and Agent (human, robot) variables. Measures of behavioral aggression used in previous studies (i.e., noise blasts) and reported liking and anthropomorphism evaluations of humans and robots indicated that participants favored the ingroup over the outgroup, and humans over robots. Group had a greater effect than Agent, so participants preferred ingroup robots to outgroup humans.",,第2页.xls
548,Decentralized and Partially Decentralized Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Combinatorial Optimization Problems,2010,"In this paper, we describe a framework for solving computationally hard, distributed function optimization problems using reinforcement learning techniques. In particular, we model a function optimization problem as an identical payoff game played by a team of reinforcement learning agents. The team performs a stochastic search through the domain space of the parameters of the function. However, current game learning algorithms suffer from significant memory requirement, significant communication overhead and slow convergence. To alleviate these problems, we present novel decentralized and partially decentralized reinforcement learning algorithms for the team. Simulation results are presented for the NP-Hard sensor subset selection problem to show that the agents learn locally optimal parameter values and illustrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms.",,第2页.xls
549,Agent-Based Simulation of Joint Fire Support Teams - Collaboration in Network-Centric Warfare Scenarios,2011,"We present an agent-based model to compare different coordination patterns in joint fire support (JFS) scenarios. Modern warfighting approaches depend heavily on a separation of concerns (like reconnaissance, coordination and engagement) and therefore impose high requirements on the coordination of all involved parties. Following the General Reference Model for Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (GRAMS), we present an agent-based model of this problem domain. Our simulations indicate that decentralized JFS coordination leads to smaller average times from identification of a target to final engagement, while at the same time requiring extensive resources. Central coordination is more effective in terms of engaged units and reduced resource requirements, but tends to take more time.",,第2页.xls

553,The Metaverse and Conversational AI as a Threat Vector for Targeted Influence,2023,"Over the last 18 months, two human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies have rapidly come to mainstream markets, funded by massive investments from major corporations. The first area of advancement has been virtual and augmented worlds, now commonly called The Metaverse. The second area of advancement has been the foundational AI models that allow users to freely interact with computers through natural dialog. Commonly referred to as Conversational AI, this technology has advanced rapidly with the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). When combined, these two disciplines will enable users to hold conversations with realistic virtual agents. While this will unleash many positive applications, there is significant danger of abuse. Most significant is the potential deployment of real-time interactive experiences that are designed to persuade, coerce, or manipulate users as a form of AI-powered targeted influence. This issue has largely been overlooked by policymakers who have focused instead on traditional privacy, bias and surveillance risks. It is increasingly important for policymakers to appreciate that interactive influence campaigns can be deployed through AI-powered Virtual Spokespeople (VSPs) that look, speak, and act like authentic users but are designed to push the interests of third parties. Because this AI Manipulation Problem is unique to real-time interactive environments, it is presented in this paper in the context of Control Theory to help policymakers appreciate that regulations are likely needed to protect against closed-loop forms of influence, especially when Conversational AI is deployed.",,第2页.xls

They must decide when to default on commitments to the group in order to commit to potentially more valuable outside offers. The SPIRE experimental system allows the study of intention reconciliation in team contexts. This paper presents a new framework for SPIRE that allows for mathematical specification and provides a basis for the study of learning. Analysis shows that a reactive policy can be expected to perform as well as more complex policies that look ahead. We present an algorithm for learning when to default on group commitments based solely on observed values of group-related tasks and discuss the applicability of this algorithm in settings where multiple agents may be learning.",,第2页.xls
555,Mastering the Game of 3v3 Snakes with Rule-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,2022,"As a popular game around the world, Snakes has multiple modes with different settings. In this work, we are dedicated to the 3v3 Snakes, which is characterized by a complex mixture of competition and cooperation. To address this mode of Snakes, most existing AI agents adopt rule based methods, which achieve limited performance due to human's oversight of some special circumstances. Inspired by the superiority of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we propose a rule-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm and build a 3v3 Snakes AI. Specifically, we introduce the territory matrix which is commonly utilized in rule based methods to the state features and mask the illegal actions through designed rules. The relationships of individual-team and friends-foes are also merged into reward design. Trained with Distributed PPO and self-play on a single GeForce RTX 2080 GPU for twenty-four hours, our AI achieves state-of-the-art performance and beats human players. On JIDI platform, our agent outperforms the other 132 participating agents and ranks the first for more than 20 consecutive days.",,第2页.xls

In particular, within the agent-based paradigm, we will have deceiving agents. Several kinds of deception will be present in interactions with users, or among people via computer, or among artificial agents, not only for malicious reasons (war, commerce, fraud, etc.) but also for goodwill and in our interest. Social control, trust and moral aspects in artificial societies will be the focus of theoretical work as well as of implementation.

557,Multiple task allocation problems with team formation,2002,"We address a problem in which multiple agents are assigned tasks, some of which can be accomplished cooperatively by teams. This task allocation problem is an NP-hard hierarchical combinatorial optimization problem. We consider procedures for imposing restrictions on task and team combinations. Through task classification, imposing restrictions on the number of tasks that an agent can perform, and the number of agents that a team can have, the set of feasible allocations is significantly reduced. Based on these restrictions, we apply a first step in which we apply n apriori algorithm to generate all tasks that an agent can perform. Second, we devise a breadth-first search algorithm to generate all teams that can perform the given tasks, and then construct all team configurations that can perform the given task classification. Third, through least cost calculations, we produce the optimal team configuration and the corresponding task classification. Advantages of the method are that it significantly reduces the calculation of the cost function, and generates an optimal task classification while forming a high performance team configuration. Finally, we discuss the application of the method to the command and control of multiple Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV).",,第2页.xls
558,"A multi-agent system integrating reinforcement learning, bidding and genetic algorithms",2003,"This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning bidding approach (MARLBS) for performing multi-agent reinforcement learning. MARLBS integrates reinforcement learning, bidding and genetic algorithms. The general idea of our multi-agent systems is as follows: There are a number of individual agents in a team, each agent of the team has two modules: Q module and CQ module. Each agent can select actions to be performed at each step, which are done by the Q module. While the CQ module determines at each step whether the agent should continue or relinquish control. Once an agent relinquishes its control, a new agent is selected by bidding algorithms. We applied GA-based MARLBS to the Backgammon game. The experimental results show MARLBS can achieve a superior level of performance in game-playing, outperforming PubEval, while the system uses zero built-in knowledge.",,第2页.xls
559,Prototyping considered dangerous,1995,"In this paper, we argue that prototypes can hinder, rather than aid effective communication. The dangers are: (1) prototypes may contain hidden assumptions which might surface too late; (2) obtaining feedback in the context of use is prohibitively expensive and rarely done; and (3) partly as a consequence of these problems, prototypes cause a focus on displays and other surface features of computers, not on the more difficult problem of how people function in their environments to solve problems. We propose design intent which specifies how a system will fit in and interact with the environment in which it is placed and expectation agents which monitor the system in use and detect uses counter to the intent as ways to alleviate these dangers.",,第2页.xls
560,Case Study: Applying Automated Optimization Tooling to Microservice Environments that Scale Safely at Ancestry.com and the Learnings,2024,"In 2018, Ancestry migrated into Amazon's public cloud. Hundreds of applications that were hosted on physical hardware were migrated to the cloud onto internally supported Kubernetes environments. This established a microservice architecture for many applications at Ancestry. In 2020, Ancestry's cloud expenses goals were set at $12M in Operating expenses savings over 2 years. To overcome the problem of scale, an automated right-sizing effort needed to take place. Ancestry purchased a tool called Opsani. Opsani allowed the team to use dynamic canary testing in combination with a Canary Advisor to act as the AI agent. Opsani was integrated into Ancestry's continuous integration and continuous delivery platform to automate right-sizing and help reach cost optimization targets with limited resources. After a successful proof of concept was developed by the DNA Matches agile team, there was a company-wide integration of Opsani into Ancestry's CI/CD platform. The tool would need to scale out continuous optimization efforts across many of the teams utilizing Kubernetes and virtual machine infrastructure. This case study details the experience and knowledge gained from scaling automation optimizations using an AI agent with more than 200 individual applications across 30 agile teams. The challenges introduced by the rate of changes in the system and monitoring feedback delays began to affect the customer experience with the product. As teams adopted optimization changes at higher rates, new guard rails were introduced to control the release cycles and ensure stability for paying customers.",,第2页.xls
561,Theory of Mind Modeling in Search and Rescue Teams,2022,"Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to make inferences about other's mental states. Such ability is fundamental for human social activities such as empathy, teamwork, and communication. As intelligent agents come to be involved in diverse human-agent teams, they will also be expected to be socially intelligent in order to become effective teammates. In this paper, we describe a computational ToM model which observes team behaviors and infers their mental states in a urban search and rescue (US&R) task. Our modular ToM model approximates human inference by explicitly representing beliefs, belief updates, and action prediction/generation using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To validate our model we compare its performance to the gold standard of human observers asked to make the same inferences. The ToM model proved superior to the average judgments of human observers on all four tests of inference and better than 90th percentile observers on three of the four. While the learning bias provided by modularizing belief and prediction proved sufficient for the simple inferences tested, substantial refinement will be needed to replicate the complex nuanced chains of inference observed in human social interaction.",,第2页.xls

The paper presents a multi-a gent architecture for specifying, analyzing and developing SCM systems, in which asynchronous teams (A-Team) of problem solving agents exchange results within populations that provide effective management of information flows in supply chains, and cooperate to produce sets of non-dominated solutions that show the tradeoffs between objectives. Our approach distinguishes itself by improving problem-solving efficiency based on a diverse set of algorithms without complicated synthesis efforts, removing the focus from agent communication and coordination details, and improving reusability, flexibility and extensibility by supporting object-oriented and component-based programming style. We examine the effectiveness of the architecture through areal-world case study and experimental results.",,第2页.xls

566,Mechanism Design for Team Formation,2015,"Team formation is a core problem in AI. Remarkably, little prior work has addressed the problem of mechanism design for team formation, accounting for the need to elicit agents' preferences over potential team-mates. Coalition formation in the related hedonic games has received much attention, but only from the perspective of coalition stability, with little emphasis on the mechanism design objectives of true preference elicitation, social welfare, and equity. We present the first formal mechanism design framework for team formation, building on recent combinatorial matching market design literature. We exhibit four mechanisms for this problem, two novel, two simple extensions of known mechanisms from other domains. Two of these (one new, one known) have desirable theoretical properties. However, we use extensive experiments to show our second novel mechanism, despite having no theoretical guarantees, empirically achieves good incentive compatibility, welfare, and fairness.",,第2页.xls

568,Understanding communications in medical emergency situations,2016,"Good communication is essential within teams dealing with emergency situations. In this paper we look at communications within a resuscitation team performing cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Communication underpins efficient collaboration, joint coordination of work, and helps to construct a mutual awareness of the situation. Poor communication wastes valuable time and can ultimately lead to life threatening mistakes. Although training sessions frequently focus on medical knowledge and procedures, soft skills, such as communication receive less attention. This paper analyses communication problems in the case of CPR and proposes an architecture that merges a situation awareness model and the belief-desire-intention (BDI) approach in multi-agent systems. The architecture forms the basis of an agent-based simulator used to assess communication protocols in CPR teams.",,第2页.xls

570,DIDE: a multi-agent environment for engineering design,1995,"Real world engineering design projects require the cooperation of multidisciplinary design teams using sophisticated and powerful engineering tools. The individuals or the individual groups of the multidisciplinary design teams work in parallel and independently with the different engineering tools which are located on the different sites for, often, a long time. In order to ensure the coordination of the design activities of the different groups or the cooperation among the different engineering tools, it is necessary to develop an efficient distributed intelligent design environment. This paper discusses a distributed architecture for integrating such engineering tools in an open design environment organized as a population of asynchronous cognitive agents. Before introducing the general architecture and the communication protocol, issues about the agent architecture and the inter-agent communication are discussed. A prototype of such an environment with seven independent agents located in the different workstations and microcomputers is presented and an example of a small mechanical design is used for demonstrating such an environment.",,第2页.xls
571,Analyzing human and virtual agent interaction under irrational decision making,2012,"The incapability of virtual agents to analyze the irrational behavior in human-virtual agent interactions urges to develop efficient mechanisms to capture the irrationality. Irrational actions in cognitive interactions are employed to attract the opponent's trust or to make future actions harder to anticipate. Recent works mostly investigate interactions of multiple decision makers with perfect knowledge which select optimal actions, a scenario that is not applicable when irrationality comes in. In this paper, the social interaction between a human and a virtual agent over a known utility function is considered while irrational actions are allowed. The existence of correlated equilibria is shown under some mild assumptions. Using the action history of both players, a measure of irrationality, which is variance-optimal, is proposed. Exploiting the irrationality measure, a probabilistic mechanism for decision making is suggested and it is shown that the sequence of decisions chosen under this mechanism leads to equilibria for sufficient number of iterations. Restating the interaction as an iterative game, the existence of equilibria is shown for two types of games i.e. simultaneous games and leader-follower (Stackelberg) games. Even though our method considers human-virtual agent interaction, the results extend to any two-player finite discrete game. An HCI experiment validates our proposed approach and corroborates the efficiency of the proposed method.",,第2页.xls
572,Gathering with a strong team in weakly Byzantine environments [arXiv],2020,"We study the gathering problem requiring a team of mobile agents to gather at a single node in arbitrary networks. The team consists of k agents with unique identifiers (IDs), and f of them are weakly Byzantine agents, which behave arbitrarily except falsifying their identifiers. The agents move in synchronous rounds and cannot leave any information on nodes. If the number of nodes n is given to agents, the existing fastest algorithm tolerates any number of weakly Byzantine agents and achieves gathering with simultaneous termination in O(n4∙ |Lambdagood|∙X(n)) rounds, where |Lambdagood| is the length of the maximum ID of non-Byzantine agents and X(n) is the number of rounds required to explore any network composed of n nodes. In this paper, we ask the question of whether we can reduce the time complexity if we have a strong team, i.e., a team with a few Byzantine agents, because not so many agents are subject to faults in practice. We give a positive answer to this question by proposing two algorithms in the case where at least 4f2+ 9f + 4 agents exist. Both the algorithms take the upper bound N of n as input. The first algorithm achieves gathering with non-simultaneous termination in O((f + |Lambdagood|) ∙ X(N)) rounds. The second algorithm achieves gathering with simultaneous termination in O((f + |Lambdaall|) ∙ X(N)) rounds, where |Lambdaall| is the length of the maximum ID of all agents. The second algorithm significantly reduces the time complexity compared to the existing one if n is given to agents and |Lambdaall|= O(|Lambdagood|) holds.",,第2页.xls

574,Collaborative Agent Planning Using a Subjective Logic Based Trust Model,2010,"In multi-agent systems, most of the time an agent will participate in some team activities, based on shared plans and aimed at achieving some complex collective goals. The complex goals are decomposed into basic activities to be performed by different individuals in the team; thus an agent might have to fullfill her obligations as a team member by pursuing particular team sub-goals. The agent will have to tackle the problem related to uncertainty about the knowledge, performances and risks involved by the decision to help her peers. This paper presents Belief Recipe Trees, an improved solution for the problem of deciding how to engage in a collaborative activity for helping a partner. It extends the approach based on SharedPlans and probabilistic recipe trees by using a trust model based on opinions (subjective probabilities) for the likelihood of success of basic actions performed by particular agents (instead of general probabilities describing the action as a whole). It offers the opportunity to estimate the probabilities even if just a small number of interactions have been previously observed and to judge about whether to seek for more information (and pay a price) or just to rely on the available one is suggested.",,第2页.xls
575,Roles of an intelligent tutor agent in a virtual society,2005,"In this paper we investigate how agents can facilitate and mediate interaction, communication and cooperation among participants of spatially distributed teams. We illustrate the architecture of an agent mediated-collaborative system that can serve the role of a tutor within a virtual group. In the virtual group the software agent should play besides the tutoring role also the group management role. The group manager has the responsibility to control the coherence of the actual group in regard to the actual group structure definition. This research will highlight also the incorporation of social-filter algorithms to mental models of software animated agents. Those algorithms may qualify an agent's expression of its emotional state by the social context, thereby enhancing the agent's believability not only as a tutor but also as a conversational partner or virtual teammate.",,第2页.xls
576,Towards flexible teamwork,1997,"Teamwork is becoming increasingly critical in many multi-agent environments, such as, virtual training, interactive education, internet-based information integration, RoboCup robotic and synthetic soccer, interactive entertainment, and potential multirobotic space missions. Teamwork in these complex, dynamic domains is more than a simple union of simultaneous coordinated activity. An illustrative example provided by Cohen and Levesque (1991)worth repeating, given that the difference between simple coordination and teamwork is often unacknowledged in the literaturefocuses on the distinction between ordinary traffic and driving in a convoy. Ordinary traffic is simultaneous and coordinated by traffic signs, but it is not considered teamwork. Driving in a convoy, however, is an example of teamwork. The difference in the two situations is that while teamwork does involve coordination, in addition, it at least involves a common team goal and cooperation among team members. This short note focuses on the development of a general model of teamwork to enable a team to act coherently, overcoming the uncertainties of complex, dynamic environments. In particular, in these environments, team members often encounter differing, incomplete and possibly inconsistent views of the world and (mental) state of other agents. To act coherently, team members must flexibly communicate to avoid miscoordination. Furthermore, such environments can often cause particular team members to unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities, or to discover unexpected opportunities. Teams must thus be capable of monitoring performance, and flexibly reorganizing and reallocating resources to meet any contingencies.",,第2页.xls

580,A constraint-based robotic soccer team,2002,"It is a challenging task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots to cooperate with each other and to compete with another team in a dynamic, real-time environment. For a robot team to play soccer successfully, various technologies have to be incorporated including robotic architecture, multi-agent collaboration and real-time reasoning. A robot is an integrated system, with a controller embedded in its plant. A robotic system is the coupling of a robot to its environment. Robotic systems are, in general, hybrid dynamic systems, consisting of continuous, discrete and event-driven components. Constraint nets (CN) provide a semantic model for modeling hybrid dynamic systems. Controllers are embedded constraint solvers that solve constraints in real-time. A controller for our robot soccer team, UBC Dynamo98, has been modeled in CN, and implemented in Java, using the Java Beans architecture. A coach program using an evolutionary algorithm has also been designed and implemented to adjust the weights of the constraints and other parameters in the controller. The results demonstrate that the formal CN approach is a practical tool for designing and implementing controllers for robots in multi-agent real-time environments. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of applying the evolutionary algorithm to the CN-modeled controllers.",,第2页.xls
581,An SoS Framework for Improved Collaborative Decision Making,2019,"Efficient team decision making has become vital in organizations, dominated by the complex system of systems (SoS). Inefficient decisions can result in significant extra cost and reduction in the overall performance within the organizations. Therefore, SoS success requires an adaptable design that can proactively evaluate and modify decisions in a dynamic process. Improved systems engineering (SE) processes and tools are needed during the systems' development lifecycle to make decisions, and rapidly evaluate and assess multiple design alternatives to effectively select the architectural design strategies that yield the highest mission performance. This research aims to increase the knowledge of SoS engineering by developing an agent-based model of team collaboration in an operational SoS. The model evaluates and selects the decision(s) for SoS comprised of collaborative teams that result in higher mission performance. The proposed agent-based model was applied to test the team decision-making improvements within the SoS structure of the air transportation domain. The experimental results indicated significant improvements in decision coordination, decision workload, and overall mission performance in the air transportation domain. This research contributes to the agent-based modeling of the SoS teams and can assist with evaluating team decisions and improving decision making as an essential element in the field of SE.",,第2页.xls
582,The Metaverse and Conversational AI as a Threat Vector for Targeted Influence,2023,"Over the last 18 months, two human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies have rapidly come to mainstream markets, funded by massive investments from major corporations. The first area of advancement has been virtual and augmented worlds, now commonly called The Metaverse. The second area of advancement has been the foundational AI models that allow users to freely interact with computers through natural dialog. Commonly referred to as Conversational AI, this technology has advanced rapidly with the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). When combined, these two disciplines will enable users to hold conversations with realistic virtual agents. While this will unleash many positive applications, there is significant danger of abuse. Most significant is the potential deployment of real-time interactive experiences that are designed to persuade, coerce, or manipulate users as a form of AI-powered targeted influence. This issue has largely been overlooked by policymakers who have focused instead on traditional privacy, bias and surveillance risks. It is increasingly important for policymakers to appreciate that interactive influence campaigns can be deployed through AI-powered Virtual Spokespeople (VSPs) that look, speak, and act like authentic users but are designed to push the interests of third parties. Because this AI Manipulation Problem is unique to real-time interactive environments, it is presented in this paper in the context of Control Theory to help policymakers appreciate that regulations are likely needed to protect against closed-loop forms of influence, especially when Conversational AI is deployed.",,第2页.xls

The primary goal is to assist users, particularly students and inexperienced designers, in evaluating web interfaces. Our tool, operating as a conversational agent, provides detailed evaluations of a user-specified task by intelligently guessing the subtasks and actions required to accomplish them, answering the standard CW questions, and providing helpful feedback and practical suggestions to improve the usability of the analyzed interface. For our study, we selected a group of web applications designed by students from a Web and Software Architecture course.

Finally a system (mPower) based on the proposed approach is introduced and applied to a location-based group decision problem.,,第2页.xls
587,Team Consensus for a Network of Unmanned Vehicles in Presence of Actuator Faults,2010,"In this paper, performance analysis of a team of unmanned vehicles (agents) that are subject to actuator faults is investigated. The team goal is to accomplish a cohesive motion in a modified leader-follower architecture by using a semi-decentralized optimal control strategy. The controller, which is recently proposed by the authors, is designed based on minimization of individual cost functions by using the available information from the neighboring sets. It is shown that a loss of effectiveness (LOE) fault in an actuator does not deteriorate the stability nor the consensus seeking goal of the team. This fault would only result in a different transient behavior, e.g., a change in the agent's convergence rate, without a change in the consensus value. On the other hand, if the fault in one or more of the agents is of the float type, either in the leader or the followers, the team could not maintain its consensus any longer, however the stability of the team can still be guaranteed. Moreover, the leader and the healthy followers adapt themselves to the follower's change when a float fault occurs in one of the agents. Finally, the behavior of the team in presence of the lock-in-place (LIP) actuator fault is also investigated. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the team subject to the above three actuator fault scenarios.",,第2页.xls

Intelligent software agents, that represent logistic objects like shipping containers, plan and schedule their way through a logistic network. This paper addresses the aspect of cooperation. A special focus lies on the second step of the model for cooperation, namely team formation. The question is by which criteria shipping containers, or logistic objects and agents in general, can form clusters.

590,Varying sample sizes for the co-evolution of heterogeneous agents,2004,"The evolution of a heterogeneous team is a complex problem. Evolving teams in a single population can retard the GA's ability to specialize emergent behavior, but co-evolution requires a system for evaluation at trial time. If too few combinations of partners are tested, the GA is unable to recognize fit agents; if too many agents are tested, the resultant computation time becomes excessive. We created a system based on punctuated anytime learning that only periodically tests samples of partner combinations to reduce computation time and tested a variety of sample sizes. In this paper, we present a successful method of varying the sample sizes, dependent on the level of fitness, using a box pushing task for comparison.",,第2页.xls

Towards this objective, we have designed a global framework to support policies.

592,Multiagent reactive plan application learning in dynamic environments,2002,"In addition to bottom-up learning approaches, which facilitate emergent policy learning, it also is desirable to have top-down control over learning so that a team of agents can also learn to apply general policies to diverse dynamic situations. We present a multiagent case-based learning methodology to achieve this top-down control. In this methodology, high-level symbolic plans describe policies a team of agents needs to learn to apply to different situations. For each plan whose preconditions match their current team state, agents learn to operationalize that plan. In each training scenario, each agent learns a sequence of actions that implements each step in the given plan such that the entire plan is operationalized under current external conditions. This application knowledge is acquired via searching through a small set of available high-level actions and testing the success of each sequence of actions in the situated environment. Similarity between a new situation and existing cases is measured by considering only the state internal to the team, and an agent stores the successful sequence of actions in the current plan step indexed under the current external state. By repeating this process for each plan step using many diverse training scenarios, a team of agents learns how to operationalize an entire plan in a wide variety of external situations, hence achieving generality. We demonstrate our approach using the RoboCup soccer simulator.",,第2页.xls

594,Collaboration in Network-centric Warfare - Modeling Joint Fire Support Teams,2010,"This paper presents an agent-based model to compare different coordination patterns in joint fire support (JFS) scenarios. Modern war fighting approaches depend heavily on a separation of concerns (like reconnaissance, coordination and engagement) and therefore impose high requirements on the coordination of all involved parties. Following the General Reference Model for Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (GRAMS), we present an agent-based model of this problem domain. Our simulations indicate that decentralized JFS coordination leads to smaller average times from identification of a target to final engagement, while at the same time requiring extensive resources. Central coordination is more effective in terms of engaged units and reduced resource requirements, but tends to take more time.",,第2页.xls

The dynamic nature of this domain presents a complex problem for potential software agent-based approaches that support this cross-organizational integration. Currently, there are few studies that measure the impact of the dynamic environmental effects on service composition. On an on-going basis, composite services or workflow processes of Web services may be constantly changing in terms of responsiveness of services, accessibility of services and their meta-information, business process schema changes, etc. This paper describes an approach, model, and supporting software toward the efficient formation of agent teams and interaction protocols for business process orchestration in response to certain environmental conditions.",,第2页.xls
596,Asynchronous exploration of an unknown anonymous dangerous graph withO(1) pebbles,2012,"We consider the a team of asynchronous agents that must explore an unknown graph in presence of a black hole, a node which destroys all incoming agents without leaving any observable trace. Communication is achieved using pebbles that an agent can pick up, carry, and drop. It is known that, when the graph is unknown, Delta + 1 agents are necessary, and solutions exist with those many agents, using a total ofO(logDelta) pebbles, where Delta is the max node degree. On the other hand, it is also known that if the agents have a map of the graph, the problem can be solved withO(1) pebbles in total, without increasing the size of the team. In this paper we address the question of whether it is possible to locate the black hole usingO(1) pebbles even if the graph is unknown, and, if so, with how many agents. We first prove that withO(1) pebbles, Delta + 1 agents arenotsufficient. We next prove that, regardless of the team size, 2 pebbles arenotsufficient. We then show that these bounds aretightpresenting a protocol that allows to locate a black hole in an unknown anonymous graph with only 3 pebbles and Delta + 2 agents.",,第2页.xls

598,Learning team strategies: soccer case studies,1998,"We use simulated soccer to study multiagent learning. Each team's players (agents) share action set and policy, but may behave differently due to position-dependent inputs. All agents making up a team are rewarded or punished collectively in case of goals. We conduct simulations with varying team sizes, and compare several learning algorithms: TD-Q learning with linear neural networks (TD-Q), probabilistic incremental program evolution (PIPE),and a PIPE version that learns by coevolution (CO-PIPE). TD-Q is based on learning evaluation functions (EFs) mapping input/action pairs to expected reward. PIPE and CO-PIPE search policy space directly. They use adaptive probability distributions to synthesize programs that calculate action probabilities from current inputs. Our results show that linear TD-Q encounters several difficulties in learning appropriate shared EFs. PIPE and CO-PIPE, however, do not depend on EFs and find good policies faster and more reliably. This suggests that in some multiagent learning scenarios direct search in policy space can offer advantages over EF-based approaches.",,第2页.xls
599,Brain Inspired Access Synthetic Consciousness Using A Neural Network Cluster,2024,"We are embarking on identifying rudiments of accountability for actions performed by the emerging AI models just as we expect blended teams of human and AI systems. A fundamental step on this path is to define how an AI model can be said to be conscious of its actions. We propose a novel model for synthetic consciousness and argue that this model is useful for AI accountability. Synthetic consciousness is separate from any notion of AI that might be endowed with artificial or emergent consciousness. The traditional sense of sentience is not pertinent to our model. The traditional sense of sapience is also not relevant to our model. With our proposed model, we aim to ascribe a basic sense of accountability for AI system-generated behavior that bears consequential impacts. The present framework is rooted in the neurology of the brain macro-structure, which we simulate using a cluster of neural networks.",,第2页.xls

605,Ad hoc teamwork and moral feedback as a framework for safe agent behavior [arXiv],2018,"As technology develops, it is only a matter of time before agents will be capable of long term autonomy, i.e., will need to choose their actions by themselves for a long period of time. Thus, in many cases agents will not be able to be coordinated in advance with all other agents with which they may interact. Instead, agents will need to cooperate in order to accomplish unanticipated joint goals without pre-coordination. As a result, the ad hoc teamwork problem, in which teammates must work together to obtain a common goal without any prior agreement regarding how to do so, has emerged as a recent area of study in the AI literature. However, to date, no attention has been dedicated to the moral aspect of the agents' behavior, which is required to ensure that their actions' influences on other agents conform with social norms. In this research, we introduce the M-TAMER framework (a novel variant of TAMER) used to teach agents to act in accordance with human morality with respect to their teammates. Using a hybrid team (agents and people), if taking an action considered to be morally unacceptable, the agents will receive negative feedback from the human teammate(s). Using M-TAMER, agents will learn to act more consistently with respect to human morality.",,第2页.xls

607,Implementing agent teams in dynamic multiagent environments,1998,"Teamwork is becoming increasingly critical in multiagent environments ranging from virtual environments for training and education, to information integration on the Internet, to potential multirobotic space missions. Teamwork in such complex, dynamic environments is more than a simple union of simultaneous individual activity, even if supplemented with preplanned coordination. Indeed, in these dynamic environments, unanticipated events can easily cause a breakdown in such preplanned coordination. The central hypothesis in this article is that for effective teamwork, agents should be provided explicit representation of team goals and plans, as well as an explicit representation of a model of teamwork to support the execution of team plans. In our work, this model of teamwork takes the form of a set of domain independent rules that clearly outline an agent's commitments and responsibilities as a participant in team activities, and thus guide the agent's social activities while executing team plans. This article describes two implementations of agent-teams based on the above principles, one for a real-world helicopter combat simulation, and one for the RoboCup soccer simulation. The article also provides a preliminary comparison of the two agent-teams to illustrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of RoboCup as a common test bed for multiagent systems.",,第2页.xls

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, society's demand for the intelligence level of museums is increasing. General artificial intelligence represented by large language models and artificial intelligence agents has achieved milestone progress, providing new technological support for the construction of museums in the new era. The artificial intelligence agent-driven human-machine hybrid museum management architecture was proposed based on parallel intelligence and parallel museum systems, thereby further leveraging the framework of parallel interaction and parallel execution of parallel museums. The system architecture and key technologies of intelligent agent-driven parallel museums were elaborated. Parallel execution and interaction optimization between artificial museums and real museums were realized by building a production factory and operation platform for intelligent agents based on artificial systems, using computational experiments to model museums and train intelligent agents, and constructing a human-machine hybrid intelligent agent team composed of biological workers, digital workers, and robotic workers. Finally, typical cases of intelligent agent-driven parallel museums were introduced.",,第2页.xls
609,Social behavior in a team of autonomous sensors,2007,"Probabilities of physical attack are often determined by various environmental factors. As the environment changes, the probability of attack associated with an area changes. In such dynamic environments, autonomous sensors are potentially useful to optimally cover regions that have high probabilities of attack. We present results from agent-based simulations, in which autonomous sensors forage a space to find areas with high attack probabilities. Simple heuristics often resulted in optimal coverage of the attack regions, without a centralized control. By varying how quickly sensors respond to a threat, we can encourage some sensors to cover some areas, and others to hang back and defend different areas, allowing them to distribute optimally as a team. The idea of making team members hang back may seem counterintuitive. In fact, people often converge all at once to respond to an immediate threat. Our results show that it is useful to have some agents remain behind, in case the environment changes.",,第2页.xls

611,Complexity theory and collaboration: an agent-based simulator for a space mission design team,2007,"In this paper, we investigate how complexity theory can benefit collaboration by applying an agent-based computer simulation approach to a new form of synchronous real-time collaborative engineering design. Fieldwork was conducted with a space mission design team during their actual design sessions, to collect data on their group conversations, team interdependencies, and error monitoring and recovery practices. Based on the fieldwork analysis, an agent-based simulator was constructed. The simulation shows how error recovery and monitoring is affected by the number of small group, or sidebar, conversations, and consequent noise in the room environment. This simulation shows that it is possible to create a virtual environment with cooperating agents interacting in a dynamic environment. This simulation approach is useful for identifying the best scenarios and eliminating potential catastrophic combinations of parameters and values, where error recovery and workload in collaborative engineering design could be significantly impacted. This approach is also useful for defining strategies for integrating solutions into organizations.",,第2页.xls
612,A-Team Solving Distributed Resource-Constrained Multi-project Scheduling Problem,2018,"In this paper a multi-agent system based on the A-Team concept is proposed to solve the distributed resource-constrained multiproject scheduling problem (DRCMPSP). The DRCMPSP belongs to the class of the strongly NP-hard optimisation problems. In the DRCMPSP multiple distributed projects are considered, hence, a coordination of the shared decisions is needed as well as the local task schedule for each project. Multi-agent systems are the natural way of solving such problems. The proposed A-Team multi-agent system has been built using the JABAT environment where two types of the optimisation agents are involved: local and global. Local agents are used to find solutions for the local projects, and global agents are responsible for coordination of the local projects and hence, for the global solution. The approach has been tested experimentally using 140 benchmark problem instances from MPSPLIB with the average project delay (APD) as optimisation criterion.",,第2页.xls

615,Learning to reach the Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium as a team,2002,"Coordination is an important issue in multi-agent systems when agents want to maximize their revenue. Often coordination is achieved through communication, however communication has its price. We are interested in finding an approach where the communication between the agents is kept low, and a global optimal behavior can still be found.In this paper we report on an efficient approach that allows independent reinforcement learning agents to reach a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium with limited communication. The communication happens at regular time steps and is basically a signal for the agents to start an exploration phase. During each exploration phase, some agents exclude their current best action so as to give the team the opportunity to look for a possibly better Nash equilibrium. This technique of reducing the action space by exclusions was only recently introduced for finding periodical policies in games of conflicting interests. Here, we explore this technique in repeated common interest games with deterministic or stochastic outcomes.",,第2页.xls
616,Automated Post-Breach Penetration Testing through Reinforcement Learning,2020,"Predicting cyber attacks to networks is ever present challenges in the security domain. Rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made this even more challenging as machine learning algorithms are now used to attack such systems while defense systems continue to protect them with traditional approaches. Penetration testing (pentest) has long been one way to prevent security breaches by mimicking black hat hackers to expose possible exploits and vulnerabilities. Using trained machine learning agents to automate this process is an important research area that still needs to be explored. The objective of this paper is to apply machine learning in the post-exploitation phase of penetration testing to assess the vulnerability of the system and hence, contribute to the automation process of penetration testing. We train the agent using reinforcement learning by providing an appropriate environment to explore a compromised network and find sensitive files. By utilizing several different network environments during training, we hope to generalize our agent as much as possible, allowing for more widespread application. Extended research may include training our agent for further lateral exploration and exploitation in the system.",,第2页.xls

A simple neural net model is applied using current and previous game experience to classify the game's parameters so that the new game conditions can be determined so that a robotic team can modify its strategy on-the-fly.

A novel technique for preserving stability and allowing balance of specialised and generalised rules in an ERL system is presented, motivated by accessibility of concepts in human cognition, as opposed to natural selection through population survivability common to ERL systems. Reinforcement learning in dynamic teams of mutable agents enables play comparable to hand-crafted artificial players. Performance and stability of development is enhanced when a measure of the frequency of reinforcement is separated from the quality measure of rules.",,第2页.xls
620,Trajectory prediction with imitation learning reflecting defensive evaluation in team sports,2020,"In team sports, qualitative video analysis is mainly used for decision making of team tactics because of the complex interaction. Among the quantitative analyses, most of studies in team trajectory generation have been evaluated only on prediction errors and did not take tactical evaluations (e.g., good defense) into consideration. In this paper, we propose a trajectory prediction method incorporating the defensive evaluation (i.e., how well they protect the goal) into multi-agent imitation learning model. Although the proposed method had the similar prediction performance to the existing method, our method generated an improved trajectory in terms of defensive evaluation.",,第2页.xls
621,Multiple reinforcement learning agents in a static environment,2004,"Reinforcement teaming agents are used in many domains; however, multiple, benevolent, and communicating reinforcement learning agents are rarely used. This paper explores using multiple reinforcement teaming agents in a simple static environment to research methods allowing such agents to communicate during teaming. The problem of developing a model whereby reinforcement teaming agents can learn faster through the use of communication is explored. This paper develops two agents that are able to communicate with each other and able to learn about their actions using reinforcement teaming techniques. The maze environment is used as a testbed. In this environment, the two agents are required to navigate the maze and trade information about the state of each other. This information includes the expected utilities for all actions from that state. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the agents are implemented. In addition, the efficiency of this model is compared with single agents and two independent agents.",,第2页.xls
622,Toward virtual role playing based on intelligent agents,1999,"We introduce the virtual role playing (VRP) concept using intelligent agents. The objective of VRP is to provide training to incomplete teams by emulating missing human operators. Keystones of this system are the mandatory collaboration between the agents and the homogeneity of the interactions between the intelligent agents and the human operators in order to achieve a common target. This VRP system, as used in the NOVA project, aims at providing a training environment for a maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) in an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) mission.",,第2页.xls
623,A behavior-based approach to reactivity and coordination: A preliminary report,1998,"This paper gives a preliminary account of a system for developing autonomous agents operating in uncertain and rapidly changing environments. The decision-mechanism of an agent is specified in terms of behavior modules. Behavior modules specify what actions and submodules should be executed and under what conditions to fulfill some specific aims or purposes. Behavior modules can be executed simultaneously if they are compatible, allowing the agents to perform several tasks at the same time. The coordination between agents is mainly obtained through common tactics, strategies, and observations of actions of team members, rather than explicit communication. Agents act and coordinate with other agents depending on their roles.",,第2页.xls
624,A Hierarchical Variable Autonomy Mixed-Initiative Framework for Human-Robot Teaming in Mobile Robotics,2022,"This paper presents a Mixed-Initiative (MI) framework for addressing the problem of control authority transfer between a remote human operator and an AI agent when cooperatively controlling a mobile robot. Our Hierarchical Expert-guided Mixed-Initiative Control Switcher (HierEMICS) leverages information on the human operator's state and intent. The control switching policies are based on a criticality hierarchy. An experimental evaluation was conducted in a high-fidelity simulated disaster response and remote inspection scenario, comparing HierEMICS with a state-of-the-art Expert-guided Mixed-Initiative Control Switcher (EMICS) in the context of mobile robot navigation. Results suggest that HierEMICS reduces conflicts for control between the human and the AI agent, which is a fundamental challenge in both the MI control paradigm and also in the related shared control paradigm. Additionally, we provide statistically significant evidence of improved, navigational safety (i.e., fewer collisions), LOA switching efficiency, and conflict for control reduction.",,第2页.xls

626,Emergence of multiagent spatial coordination strategies through artificial coevolution,2001,"This paper describe research investigating the evolution of coordination strategies in robot soccer teams. Each player (viewed as an agent) is provided with a common set of skills and is assigned to perform over a delimited area inside a soccer field. The idea is to optimize the whole team behavior by means of a spatial coadaptation process in which new players are selected in such a way to comply with the already existing ones. The main results show that, through coevolution, we progressively create teams whose members act on complementary areas of the playing field, being capable of prevailing over a standard opponent team with a fixed formation.

628,Modeling collective learning in design,2004,"In this paper, a model of collective learning in design is developed in the context of team design. It explains that a team design activity uses input knowledge, environmental information, and design goals to produce output knowledge. A collective learning activity uses input knowledge from different agents and produces learned knowledge with the process of knowledge acquisition and transformation between different agents, which may be triggered by learning Goals and rationale triggers. Different forms of collective learning were observed with respect to agent interactions, goal(s) of learning. and involvement of an agent. Three types of links between team design and collective learning were identified, namely teleological, rationale, and epistemic. Hypotheses of collective learning are made based upon existing theories and models in design and learning, which were tested using a protocol analysis approach. The model of collective learning in design is derived from the test results. The proposed model can be used as a basis to develop c agent-based learning systems in design. In the future, collective learning between design teams, the links between collective learning and creativity, and computational support for collective learning can be investigated.",,第2页.xls

For an intelligent agent to be able to handle tasks on such a social environment a suitable model is needed, addressing the socio-organizational compo-nents. We detail such an approach, binding knowledge sharing, reputation, and organizations to allow an intelligent agent to explicitly express and manipulate a subjective view of the social environment of its human owner and how these skills can be applied to assembly a design team.

The proposed multi-agent system is expected to increase the accuracy of project prioritization and to stabilize the human resources service level. A simulation of the proposed multi-agent model is conducted.

632,Digital ShuTong: Reviving the ancient form of learning support agents,2002,"Inspired by the practice of studying escort in ancient time, this paper describes an approach to the development of learning support agency. The agency is in fact a team of small agents which embody with clearly defined and domain specific knowledge or skill. The agents are not designed as full blown instructors or tutors but only escorting the students during their study journeys and serve them as their assistants. The students still bear the major responsibility of their own learning but the agency is always at their disposal and can offer help if necessary. Among others, agility is the strongest selling point of this architecture. Whenever a new agent is developed, it simply either joins the team as new member or replaces an old agent that is due to 'retire' without bothering the students and instructors.",,第2页.xls

634,The impact of diversity on performance in multi-robot foraging,1999,"Quantitative relationships between performance and behavioral diversity are investigated in a multi-robot foraging task. The task, referred to as multi-foraging, requires robots to collect different types of object and deliver them to different locations according to type. Multi-foraging was selected for investigation because it offers even more opportunities for agent specialization than simpler foraging tasks. Three team foraging strategies are evaluated: homogeneous, where each agent is capable of delivering all types of object; specialize-by-color, where each robot specializes in collecting one type of object, and territorial, where most of the robots drop objects off near the delivery area, while the remaining agent completes the sorting and delivery. Each strategy is evaluated for diversity and performance using quantitative metrics. Data is gathered in thousands of simulation runs and the behaviors are also verified on mobile robots. In contrast to the results of a similar study in robotic soccer, the results of this research indicate homogeneous behavior is the best strategy for foraging robot teams.",,第2页.xls

636,Designing for Work with Intelligent Entities: A Review of Perspectives [arXiv],2024,"As the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to advance, there is increased interest in how best to combine AI-based agents with humans to achieve mission effectiveness. Three perspectives have emerged. The first stems from more conventional human factors traditions and views these entities as highly capable tools that humans can use to accomplish increasingly sophisticated tasks. The second camp believes that as the sophistication of these entities increases, it becomes increasingly appropriate to talk about them as teammates and use the research on human teams as a foundation for further exploration. The third perspective is emerging and finds both the tools and teammate metaphors flawed and limiting. This perspective emphasizes joint activity, joint cognitive activity, or something similar. In this article, we briefly review these three perspectives.",,第2页.xls

The paper explores a knowledge-based method supporting the process of coalition formation the tri-based acquaintance model (3bA). The 3bA maintains agents' social knowledge about collaborative agents that limits substantially the space of possible manufacturing coalitions. These ideas are supported by an implementation of the production planning multi-agent system and describing its role in manufacturing.,,第2页.xls
638,Understanding Underground Incentivized Review Services,2024,"While human factors in fraud have been studied by the HCI and security communities, most research has been directed to understanding either the victims' perspectives or prevention strategies, and not on fraudsters, their motivations and operation techniques. Additionally, the focus has been on a narrow set of problems: phishing, spam and bullying. In this work, we seek to understand review fraud on e-commerce platforms through an HCI lens. Through surveys with real fraudsters (N=36 agents and N=38 reviewers), we uncover sophisticated recruitment, execution, and reporting mechanisms fraudsters use to scale their operation while resisting takedown attempts, including the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. We find that countermeasures that crack down on communication channels through which these services operate are effective in combating incentivized reviews. This research sheds light on the complex landscape of incentivized reviews, providing insights into the mechanics of underground services and their resilience to removal efforts.",,第2页.xls
639,Modelling the Interaction Levels in HCI Using an Intelligent Hybrid System with Interactive Agents: A Case Study of an Interactive Museum Exhibition Module in Mexico,2018,"Technology has become a necessity in our everyday lives and essential for completing activities we typically take for granted; technologies can assist us by completing set tasks or achieving desired goals with optimal affect and in the most efficient way, thereby improving our interactive experiences. This paper presents research that explores the representation of user interaction levels using an intelligent hybrid system approach with agents. We evaluate interaction levels of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with the aim of enhancing user experiences. We consider the description of interaction levels using an intelligent hybrid system to provide a decision-making system to an agent that evaluates interaction levels when using interactive modules of a museum exhibition. The agents represent a high-level abstraction of the system, where communication takes place between the user, the exhibition and the environment. In this paper, we provide a means to measure the interaction levels and natural behaviour of users, based on museum user-exhibition interaction. We consider that, by analysing user interaction in a museum, we can help to design better ways to interact with exhibition modules according to the properties and behaviour of the users. An interaction-evaluator agent is proposed to achieve the most suitable representation of the interaction levels with the aim of improving user interactions to offer the most appropriate directions, services, content and information, thereby improving the quality of interaction experienced between the user-agent and exhibition-agent.",,第2页.xls

641,Building agent teams using an explicit teamwork model and learning,1999,"Multi-agent collaboration or teamwork and learning are two critical research challenges in a large number of multi-agent applications. These research challenges are highlighted in RoboCup, an international project focused on robotic and synthetic soccer as a common testbed for research in multi-agent systems. This article describes our approach to address these challenges, based on a team of soccer-playing agents built for the simulation league of RoboCup-the most popular of the RoboCup leagues so far.To address the challenge of teamwork, we investigate a novel approach based on the (re)use of a domain-independent, explicit model of teamwork, an explicitly represented hierarchy of team plans and goals, and a team organization hierarchy based on roles and role-relationships. This general approach to teamwork, shown to be applicable in other domains beyond RoboCup, both reduces development time and improves teamwork flexibility. We also demonstrate the application of off-line and on-line learning to improve and specialize agents' individual skills in RoboCup. These capabilities enabled our soccer-playing team, ISIS, to successfully participate in the first international RoboCup soccer tournament (RoboCup'97) held in Nagoya, Japan, in August 1997. ISIS won the third-place prize in over 30 teams that participated in the simulation league. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",,第2页.xls

643,Evolution Strategies Enhanced Complex Multiagent Coordination,2023,"Multi-agent coordination involves both the individual reward and team reward, where the former guides the agent to learn basic skills and the latter measures how well such a team cooperatively completes final tasks. However, in many complex scenarios, these two aspects can be contradictory, due to that one agent excessively pursuing its own profits may suppress the performance of other teammates and lead to the reduction of overall profits. Besides, such dual rewards are generally entangled which make the learning swing between optimizing either the former or latter, which further leads to the sub-optimal and unstable solutions. Moreover, the sparse reward problem commonly encountered in the multi-agent system would further exacerbate this contradiction. In the present work, we address these challenges by proposing CEMARL, a novel framework combining cross-entropy method (CEM) and off-policy multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). CEM is gradient-free and learns from the whole episode, whereas MARL is gradient-based and learns from the experiences of agents. The core idea behind CEMARL is that it explicitly decomposes the individual reward and team reward, and deals with them through gradient-based learning and gradient-free evolution, respectively. By means of this, it can simultaneously maximize the individual and team reward, and reconciles the contradiction between individual and team as well as the sparse reward problem. CEMARL shows both conciseness in framework and stability in training, and achieves significantly better performances than state-of-the-art baselines on a range of complex tasks.",,第2页.xls
644,A neural network-based multi-agent classifier system,2009,"In this paper, we propose a neural network (NN)-based multi-agent classifier system (MACS) using the trust, negotiation, and communication (TNC) reasoning model. The main contribution of this work is that a novel trust measurement method, based on the recognition and rejection rates, is proposed. Besides, an auctioning procedure, based on the sealed bid, first price method, is adapted for the negotiation phase. Two agent teams are formed; each consists of three NN learning agents. The first is a fuzzy min-max (FMM) NN agent team and the second is a fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) NN agent team. Modifications to the FMM and FAM models are also proposed so that they can be used for trust measurement in the TNC model. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model and the bond (based on trust), five benchmark data sets are tested, The results compare favorably with those from a number of classification methods published in the literature.

645,Selecting a Representative Data Set of the Required Size Using the Agent-Based Population Learning Algorithm,2012,"The aim of this article is to propose and evaluate an agent-based population learning algorithm generating, through prototype selection, a representative training data set of the required size. The main feature of the proposed approach is selection of the representative feature vectors, called prototypes, from clusters of feature vectors constructed over the original training data set under the assumption that from each cluster a single prototype is obtained. Thus, the number of clusters produced from the original training data set has a direct influence on the size of the reduced data set. The process of selection is executed by a team of agents, which execute various local search procedures and cooperate to determine a solution to the instance reduction problem, aiming at obtaining a compact representation of the data set. Rules for agent cooperation during the clustering and selection processes are defined within the so-called working strategy used by the team of agents (A-Team) in question. The article proposes a set of procedures that are used by agents to produce clusters and select prototypes. The approach is validated experimentally using well-known benchmark data sets. In addition to the computational experiment used to validate the model, the article investigates the efficiency and performance of two different working strategies used by the proposed A-Team. Because the proposed approach is based on the population learning algorithm, which belongs to the class of the population-based methods, an evaluation of the influence of the population of solution size on the performance of the algorithm is also included.",,第2页.xls
646,Monitoring teams by overhearing: A multi-agent plan-recognition approach,2002,"Recent years are seeing an increasing need for on-line monitoring of teams of cooperating agents, e.g., for visualization, or performance tracking. However, in monitoring deployed teams, we often cannot rely on the agents to always communicate their state to the monitoring system. This paper presents a non-intrusive approach to monitoring by overhearing, where the monitored team's state is inferred (via plan-recognition) from team-members' routine communications, exchanged as part of their coordinated task execution, and observed (overheard) by the monitoring system. Key challenges in this approach include the demanding run-time requirements of monitoring, the scarceness of observations (increasing monitoring uncertainty), and the need to scale-up monitoring to address potentially large teams. To address these, we present a set of complementary novel techniques, exploiting knowledge of the social structures and procedures in the monitored team: (i) an efficient probabilistic plan-recognition algorithm, well-suited for processing communications as observations; (ii) an approach to exploiting knowledge of the team's social behavior to predict future observations during execution (reducing monitoring uncertainty); and (iii) monitoring algorithms that trade expressivity for scalability, representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses, but allowing for any number of agents and their different activities to be represented in a single coherent entity. We present an empirical evaluation of these techniques, in combination and apart, in monitoring a deployed team of agents, running on machines physically distributed across the country, and engaged in complex, dynamic task execution. We also compare the performance of these techniques to human expert and novice monitors, and show that the techniques presented are capable of monitoring at human-expert levels, despite the difficulty of the task.",,第2页.xls

648,Preventing (Another) Lubitz: The Thermodynamics of Teams and Emotion,2016,"We propose a series of metrics enacted with Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on quantum mechanics (e.g., the substitution of interdependence for entanglement), entropy (e.g., the maximum random exploration of solution spaces for maximum entropy production, or MEP) and biology (e.g., in Hilbert space, counting neutral voters as entangled agents that produce limit cycles). Once humans teach a team of machines to perform at a level that meets human expectations, the computational team will also know how its human supervisors are supposed to perform. What happens once the machines discover that their human counterparts can make human mistakes is becoming an area of research. Most accidents are caused by human error, including malfeasance, incompetence and, as in the case of Lubitz, murder. The idea for our application is built around a computational model of emotion. Assuming the lowest state for a well-performing team is its ground state, elevated states can be labeled as emotional states to serve as a team metric. For co-pilot Lubitz who purposively flew his Germanwings aircraft into the Alps to murder his passengers, contradicting the prevailing view that little can be done to prevent other pilots with malevolent aims, an opportunity for an intelligent AI system to take temporary command of a distressed crew aboard an aircraft, overseen perhaps by air controllers on the ground, might be able to prevent similar tragedies. But the case of Lubitz is more general and widespread than addressing a miscreant; e.g., inattentive submarine commanders; human error with automobiles; overloaded crews at sea.",,第2页.xls

651,Distributed task allocation in multi-agent environments using cellular learning automata,2019,"People's safety is threatened by the repetition of critical events. Many people lose their lives due to unprofessional rescue operation as well as time pressure of the rescue operation. A key problem in urban search and rescue teams, considering the severe turbulence and complexity of the environments which are hit by a crisis, is the coordination between the team members. In order to solve this problem, an effective plan would be the provision of measures where human works with intelligent assistant agents to assign the tasks in any way. Dynamic tasks are identified by the human agent of the rescue team in the crisis environment and are characterized by spatial-temporal characteristics assigned to the appropriate rescue team by the intelligent assistant agents who apply intelligent decision-making techniques. The objective of this study is to propose a new approach for allocating spatial-temporal tasks in multi-agent systems through cellular learning automata as the decision-making technique. Results obtained here indicate that this proposed model can significantly improve the rescue time and space.

652,Studying Shared Situation Awareness by Agent-Based Simulation,2013,"Shared Situation Awareness is an often employed concept in domains where teams of agents have to solve complex tasks in a distributed manner, like incident management and air traffic control. Although widely studied in the literature, the concept is difficult to be analyzed in a systematic manner, due to 1) the abundance of factors that can be related to Shared SA, and 2) the lack of a commonly agreed, formal definition. This paper proposes Agent-Based Social Simulation as a scientific method to study questions related to Shared SA. Founded in theories from Social Science, an agent-based framework is presented, which allows users to explore a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an automated manner. The resulting global patterns are illustrated by discussing a number of simulation results for different parameter settings. These simulations show that, although preliminary, the presented framework has potential as an analytical tool for researchers and policy makers.",,第2页.xls

We are building a new control framework for autonomous robots to reason about goals,and actions, react to unexpected situations, learn from humans and experience, and collaborate with teammates. Building such robots may require techniques that are different from those employed in separate research disciplines.

654,Fault-tolerant multi-agent scheme for leader/follower formation control of homogeneous mobile robot team,2019,"This paper deals with fault-tolerance and formation control problems for homogeneous mobile robots under leader/follower failures by using the multi-agent paradigm. These issues are addressed by a cooperative approach supported by two kinds of agents: 1) robot agents (classified into a leader and a set of followers depending on their objective function), assigned to robots for collecting information, making decisions and transferring them to physical robots for execution; 2) supervisory agent (an interface between the control system and the team), synchronises and coordinates tasks of the other agents. These agents interact by a negotiation protocol to satisfy their objectives: 1) preserve predefined leader/follower formation; 2) conserve robots order inside the formation; 3) manage dynamic disturbance events (e.g., unexpected breakdown, integration of new robots). To validate this scheme and evaluate its performances, different simulations are examined by using ten robots evolving inside a grid environment cluttered with static obstacles with/without failures.",,第2页.xls

Directly using single-agent LQ learning algorithms in such models results in regret which increases polynomially with the number of agents. We propose a new Thompson sampling based learning algorithm which exploits the structure of the system model and show that the expected Bayesian regret of our proposed algorithm for a system with agents of $|M|$ different types at time horizon $T$ is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \big( |M|^{1.5} \sqrt{T} \big)$ irrespective of the total number of agents, where the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ notation hides logarithmic factors in $T$.

In this framework, problem-solving agents possess representations of problems and algorithms that they use to locate solutions. We use this framework to establish a result relevant to group composition. We find that when selecting a problem-solving team from a diverse population of intelligent agents, a team of randomly selected agents outperforms a team comprised of the best-performing agents. This result relies on the intuition that, as the initial pool of problem solvers becomes large, the best-performing agents necessarily become similar in the space of problem solvers. Their relatively greater ability is more than offset by their lack of problem-solving diversity.",,第2页.xls

Renowned for its fusion of technology and fan engagement, the IPL stands as the world's most popular cricket league. This study concentrates on Dream11, India's leading fantasy cricket league for IPL, where participants craft virtual teams based on real player performances to compete internationally. Building a winning fantasy team requires navigating various complex factors including player form and match conditions. Traditionally, this has been approached through operations research and machine learning. This research introduces the FanCric framework, an advanced multi-agent system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a robust orchestration framework to enhance fantasy team selection in cricket. FanCric employs both structured and unstructured data to surpass traditional methods by incorporating sophisticated AI technologies. The analysis involved scrutinizing approximately 12.7 million unique entries from a Dream11 contest, evaluating FanCric's efficacy against the collective wisdom of crowds and a simpler Prompt Engineering approach. Ablation studies further assessed the impact of generating varying numbers of teams. The exploratory findings are promising, indicating that further investigation into FanCric's capabilities is warranted to fully realize its potential in enhancing strategic decision-making using LLMs in fantasy sports and business in general.",,第2页.xls
659,Effects of Agents' Transparency on Teamwork,2019,"Transparency in the field of human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence has seen a growth of interest in the past few years. Nonetheless, there are still few experimental studies on how transparency affects teamwork, in particular in collaborative situations where the strategies of others, including agents, may seem obscure.We explored this problem using a collaborative game scenario with a mixed human-agent team. We investigated the role of transparency in the agents' decisions, by having agents that reveal and tell the strategies they adopt in the game, in a manner that makes their decisions transparent to the other team members. The game embraces a social dilemma where a human player can choose to contribute to the goal of the team (cooperate) or act selfishly in the interest of his or her individual goal (defect). We designed a between-subjects experimental study, with different conditions, manipulating the transparency in a team. The results showed an interaction effect between the agents' strategy and transparency on trust, group identification and human-likeness. Our results suggest that transparency has a positive effect in terms of people's perception of trust, group identification and human likeness when the agents use a tit-for-tat or a more individualistic strategy. In fact, adding transparent behaviour to an unconditional cooperator negatively affects the measured dimensions.",,第2页.xls
660,Partner selection mechanisms for agent cooperation,2008,"In a multi-agent system, a single agent may not be capable of completing complex tasks. Therefore agents are required to form a team to fulfill the task requirements. In this paper an agent model is introduced that facilitates cooperation among agents. A multi-threaded multi-agent simulation framework is designed to test the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the model is significantly useful in achieving cooperation under various environmental constraints. It also allows agents to adjust their teammate selection strategies according to environmental constraints.",,第2页.xls
661,Agents' Monitoring Approach for Big Data,2013,"Data sources are becoming more prevalent as digital devices in the form of sensor networks, capture and record vast amounts of individual and environmental data. Much of this data is to some extent redundant, as it is captured or held at many locations, or is of a low priority level, so can safely be ignored. The distributed nature of such data, however, means that it is impossible to identify redundant or useless information without full scale analysis. The velocity of data arrival, the volume of data and the heterogeneous nature (variety) of the data makes this task unfeasible for any real time analysis, which is becoming more desirable in real world situations. Thus this paper is looking to utilize a multi-agent system or federation of agents to analyse data in a distributed manner. The method of setting up such an agent team is proposed so as to engender a cohesive team ethos endowing the agent federation with the power of a single agent's goal. It is then shown that this leads to a specific network topology to emerge within the agent team. Furthermore such a topology allows an acquaintance monitoring algorithm to be applied. This is shown to actively attenuate and prioritize data by suggesting only those sensor nodes that are likely to be in possession of useful and non-redundant data, using only data local to each agent team member. The results are gained, in this first instance, by a simulation.",,第2页.xls
662,The influence of interdependence and a transparent or explainable communication style on human-robot teamwork.,2022,"Humans and robots are increasingly working together in human-robot teams. Teamwork requires communication, especially when interdependence between team members is high. In previous work, we identified a conceptual difference between sharing what you are doing (i.e., being transparent) and why you are doing it (i.e., being explainable). Although the second might sound better, it is important to avoid information overload. Therefore, an online experiment (n = 72) was conducted to study the effect of communication style of a robot (silent, transparent, explainable, or adaptive based on time pressure and relevancy) on human-robot teamwork. We examined the effects of these communication styles on trust in the robot, workload during the task, situation awareness, reliance on the robot, human contribution during the task, human communication frequency, and team performance. Moreover, we included two levels of interdependence between human and robot (high vs. low), since mutual dependency might influence which communication style is best. Participants collaborated with a virtual robot during two simulated search and rescue tasks varying in their level of interdependence. Results confirm that in general robot communication results in more trust in and understanding of the robot, while showing no evidence of a higher workload when the robot communicates or adds explanations to being transparent. Providing explanations, however, did result in more reliance on RescueBot. Furthermore, compared to being silent, only being explainable results a higher situation awareness when interdependence is high. Results further show that being highly interdependent decreases trust, reliance, and team performance while increasing workload and situation awareness. High interdependence also increases human communication if the robot is not silent, human rescue contribution if the robot does not provide explanations, and the strength of the positive association between situation awareness and team performance. From these results, we can conclude that robot communication is crucial for human-robot teamwork, and that important differences exist between being transparent, explainable, or adaptive. Our findings also highlight the fundamental importance of interdependence in studies on explainability in robots.",,第2页.xls
663,The Solution Modelling System with Grouped Agents,2008,"The solution selecting now is becoming very globally distributed. Many enterprises or organizations have grouped many agents with many teams around the world. They build the solution models cooperatively in the different sites. There are many difficulties in the group communication, the group visual modelling, the group decision-making, etc. It's not easy for them to often come together for many meetings. So we are trying to build a group modelling system and help the distributed teams to reach a conclusion through the network. The agents can build models of the solutions in the local database, and share them with others via Intranet/internet. The modelling process, model updating and agents' working status can be conducted and traced by soft-agents. The system can reason the approximate best solutions by, using two well-known group-decision-supporting algorithms -AHP, OWG.",,第2页.xls
664,A Negotiation-Based Genetic Framework for Multi-Agent Credit Assignment,2014,"Multi agent systems are a well-defined solution for implementing dynamic complex environments. One of the open issues of these systems is credit assignment problem. The main concern of credit assignment problem is to properly distributing feedback of overall performance, and brings about learning in each individual agent. In this paper a genetic framework for solving Multi-agent credit assignment problem is proposed. Our framework, Negotiation Based Credit Assignment, NBCA, applies negotiation for both enriching agents knowledge as well as organizing populations by a mode analyzer. The proposed architecture includes a mentor agent which responsible for credit assignment without any context related information leading to a general solution. Furthermore, the mentor agent does not receive any information regarding correctness of a particular agents behavior. Carry and non-Carry cases have been considered for evaluating this method. In addition, the effects of noise as a source of uncertainty on NBCA performance are examined. Our finding indicated that the proposed method is superior to previous credit assignment approaches. This is due to the argumentation and negotiation features of multi agent systems that are used to accomplish team learning and credit assignment respectively. The analysis of obtained results which are theoretically discussed, demonstrate that, in comparison with KEBCA (OR-type), our approach performs better than KEBCA after 5000 trials in 0% noisy environment. However, it performs worse than KEBCA in 10% and 30% noisy environment.",,第2页.xls
665,Reaching Consensus At A Preset Time: Double-Integrator Dynamics Case,2012,"In the paper, a novel finite-time consensus framework for multi-agent systems with double-integrator dynamics is established. In such a framework, the multi-agent team can achieve consensus at any preset time. In order to reach this goal, linear feedback control protocols with time-varying gains are introduced. The proposed time-varying control protocols can solve consensus problems at the preset time if the undirected communication topology is connected. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.",,第2页.xls

The regional limitation must be overcome to facilitate information exchange, knowledge processing, and design result exchange, etc., among the teams. This paper proposes a multi-agent based model for cooperative design. The model consists of five types of agents according to cooperative design environment and design activities. Integrated fine grained security mechanism into different agents is the major feature of this model.",,第2页.xls
667,Partial-order planning with concurrent interacting actions,2001,"In order to generate plans for agents with multiple actuators, agent teams, or distributed controllers, we must be able to represent and plan using concurrent actions with interacting effects. This has historically been considered a challenging task requiring a temporal planner with the ability to reason explicitly about time. We show that with simple modifications, the STRIPS action representation language can be used to represent interacting actions. Moreover, algorithms for partial-order planning require only small modifications in order to be applied in such multiagent domains. We demonstrate this fact by developing a sound and complete partial-order planner for planning with concurrent interacting actions, POMP, that extends existing partial-order planners in a straightforward way. These results open the way to the use of partial-order planners for the centralized control of cooperative multiagent systems.",,第2页.xls
668,A multi-agent system architecture to classify colour images,2013,"Colour image classification plays an important role in computer vision and pattern recognition. Traditional classification research mainly focuses on developing novel techniques that are efficient for image representation or classification. By processing considerable visual information, human can handle the complicated classification tasks quite effectively. Inspirited by the structure of the visual cortex, we propose a multi-agent colour image classification architecture (MACICA). Agents within a multi-agent system (MAS) architecture are programmed to deliver specific image classification capabilities. The MACICA provides an efficient classification output by sharing knowledge, communication and team work. The architecture is flexible and dynamic, while the platform has produced encouraging results, which are presented in the paper.",,第2页.xls
669,Multi-agent Kalman consensus with relative uncertainty,2005,"In this paper, we propose discrete-time and continuous-time consensus update schemes motivated by the discrete-time and continuous-time Kalman filters. With certainty information encoded into each agent, the proposed consensus schemes explicitly account for relative confidence l reliability of information states from each agent in the team. We show mild sufficient conditions under which consensus can be achieved using the proposed consensus schemes in the presence of switching interaction topologies.",,第2页.xls
670,Multiagent RoboNBA simulation: From local behaviors to global characteristics,2005,"In this article, the authors show their current work on the relationship between local behaviors of agents and global characteristics in a multiagent NBA simulation, which is called RoboNBA. Two sources of different local behaviors are introduced: decision-making mechanisms and agent strategies. The global characteristics consist of global performance and global patterns. The authors address the problem of how to quantitatively measure the global performance and global patterns in RoboNBA. For global patterns, they focus on the diversity of attack patterns of a team. Through experiments and analysis, they try to examine how agent local behaviors can lead to different global performance and interesting global patterns in RoboNBA.",,第2页.xls
671,Real-time Training of Team Soccer Behaviors,2013,"Training robot or agent behaviors by example is an attractive alternative to directly coding them. However training complex behaviors can be challenging, particularly when it involves interactive behaviors involving multiple agents. We present a novel hierarchical learning from demonstration system which can be used to train both single-agent and scalable cooperative multiagent behaviors. The methodology applies manual task decomposition to break the complex training problem into simpler parts, then solves the problem by iteratively training each part. We discuss our application of this method to multiagent problems in the humanoid RoboCup competition, and apply the technique to the keepaway soccer problem in the RoboCup Soccer Simulator.",,第2页.xls

673,Design and simulation of trust management techniques for a coalition data sharing environment,2007,"Effective communication among agents in large teams is crucial because the members share a common goal but only have partial views of the environment. Information sharing is difficult in a large team because, a team member may have a piece of valuable information but not know who needs the information, since it is infeasible to know what each other agent is doing. Information sharing is a main part of any system or organization. The information sharing needs to be foolproof. Only the legitimate receiver should be able to get hold of the information. This paper mainly deals with intelligent software agents for information sharing with confidentiality and trust. It clearly defines an intelligent software agent, background of information sharing in intelligent agents and the trust in the agents. Some part of the information needs confidentiality. The information that is shared requires security policy enforced based on the domain of the information and trust level of individual agent. This paper also provides the results of a multi-agent simulation for sharing information. It also implements trust calculation based on the quality of information provided by the peer agents in the simulation.",,第2页.xls
674,Robust agent teams via socially-attentive monitoring,2000,"Agents in dynamic multi-agent environments must monitor their peers to execute individual and group plans. A key open question is how much monitoring of other agents' states is required to be effective: The Monitoring Selectivity Problem. We investigate this question in the context of detecting failures in teams of cooperating agents, via Socially-Attentive Monitoring, which focuses on monitoring for failures in the social relationships between the agents. We empirically and analytically explore a family of socially-attentive teamwork monitoring algorithms in two dynamic, complex, multi-agent domains, under varying conditions of task distribution and uncertainty. We show that a centralized scheme using a complex algorithm trades correctness for completeness and requires monitoring all teammates. In contrast, a simple distributed teamwork monitoring algorithm results in correct and complete detection of teamwork failures, despite relying on limited, uncertain knowledge, and monitoring only key agents in a team. In addition, we report on the design of a socially-attentive monitoring system and demonstrate its generality in monitoring several coordination relationships, diagnosing detected failures, and both on-line and off-line applications.",,第2页.xls

This article outlines some of the important lessons learned from a successfully deployed team of personal assistant agents (Electric Elves) in an office environment. In the Electric Elves project, a team of almost a dozen personal assistant agents were continually active for seven months. Each elf (agent) represented one person and assisted in daily activities in an actual office environment. This project led to several important observations about privacy, adjustable autonomy, and social norms in office environments. In addition to outlining some of the key lessons learned we outline our continued research to address some of the concerns raised.",,第2页.xls
676,Interactive multi-agent learning,2004,"If agents are to learn as a team and benefit from each other's effort, single agent individual learning mechanisms must be extended towards a multi-agent learning perspective. To do so, additional ways of sharing and gathering information have to be considered so that the agents can interact during the learning process. Since a multi-agent system is a system of agent interaction, its inborn potential can be used to serve this purpose. In other words, rather than simply extending the traditional individual learning mechanisms with specific interaction protocols, the activity that concerns the intermediate steps of the collective learning process can use the structure of the multi-agent system, benefit from its potentialities, and follow the flow of agent interaction. This form of multi-agent learning is called interactive multi-agent learning and there are good reasons to expect that it can lead to better results in dealing with certain problems that appeal to collective learning.",,第2页.xls
677,Multi-agent coverage in urban environments [arXiv],2020,"We study multi-agent coverage algorithms for autonomous monitoring and patrol in urban environments. We consider scenarios in which a team of flying agents uses downward facing cameras (or similar sensors) to observe the environment outside of buildings at street-level. Buildings are considered obstacles that impede movement, and cameras are assumed to be ineffective above a maximum altitude. We study multi-agent urban coverage problems related to this scenario, including: (1) static multi-agent urban coverage, in which agents are expected to observe the environment from static locations, and (2) dynamic multi-agent urban coverage where agents move continuously through the environment. We experimentally evaluate six different multi-agent coverage methods, including: three types of ergodic coverage (that avoid buildings in different ways), lawn-mower sweep, voronoi region based control, and a naive grid method. We evaluate all algorithms with respect to four performance metrics (percent coverage, revist count, revist time, and the integral of area viewed over time), across four types of urban environments [low density, high density] x [short buildings, tall buildings], and for team sizes ranging from 2 to 25 agents. We believe this is the first extensive comparison of these methods in an urban setting. Our results highlight how the relative performance of static and dynamic methods changes based on the ratio of team size to search area, as well the relative effects that different characteristics of urban environments (tall, short, dense, sparse, mixed) have on each algorithm.",,第2页.xls
678,Handling communication restrictions and team formation in congestion games,2006,"There are many domains in which a multi-agent system needs to maximize a system utility function which rates the performance of the entire system, while subject to communication restrictions among the agents. Such communication restrictions make it difficult for agents that take actions to optimize their own private utilities to also help optimize the system utility. In this article we show how previously introduced utilities that promote coordination among agents can be modified to be effective in domains with communication restrictions. The modified utilities provide performance improvements of up to 75 over previously used utilities in congestion games (i.e., games where the system utility depends solely on the number of agents choosing a particular action). In addition, we show that in the presence of severe communication restrictions, team formation for the purpose of information sharing among agents leads to an additional 25 improvement in system utility. Finally, we show that agents' private utilities and team sizes can be manipulated to form the best compromise between how aligned an agent's utility is with the system utility and how easily an agent can learn that utility.",,第2页.xls

This paper describes CoPSF, a multiagent system middle-ware that simplifies the development of coordinated problem solving applications while ensuring standard compliance through a set of system services and agents. CoPSF hosts and serves multiple concurrent teams of problem solving contributing both to the limitation of communication overheads and to the reduction of redundant work across teams and organizations.

682,Teamwork Reinforcement Learning With Concave Utilities,2024,"Complex reinforcement learning (RL) tasks often require a divide-and-conquer approach, where a large task is divided into pieces and solved by individual agents. In this paper, we study a teamwork RL setting where individual agents make decisions on disjoint subsets (blocks) of the state space and have private interests (reward functions), while the entire team aims to maximize a general long-term team utility function and may be subject to constraints. This team utility, which is not necessarily a cumulative sum of rewards, is modeled as a nonlinear function of the team's joint state-action occupancy distribution. By leveraging the inherent duality of policy optimization, we propose a min-max multi-block policy optimization framework to decompose the overall problem into individual local tasks. This enables a federated teamwork mechanism where a team lead coordinates individual agents via reward shaping, and each agent solves its local task defined only on its local state subset. We analyze the convergence of this teamwork policy optimization mechanism and establish an O(1/T) convergence rate to the team's joint optimum. This mechanism allows team members to jointly find the global socially optimal policy while keeping their local privacy.",,第2页.xls
683,On the Premise of a Swarm Guidance Ontology for Human-Swarm Teaming,2022,"Effective Human-Swarm Teaming (HST) relies on bi-directional information flow between the human and the swarm. Systems with human control or oversight rely on information flow from the swarm to the humans to inform decisions, while information that flows back from humans is only that necessary for actuation, which remains primarily physical. To unlock the full potential of HSTs, the augmentation must extend into the overall logic of teaming, including both the human's and machine's cognitive domains, whereby an AI-equipped robot teammate is capable of complex cognitive functions. The effectiveness of HST will need a sufficient level of transparency in the interaction space formed by the bi-directional information flow between the human and the swarm. This transparency must continuously and constructively interpret the information exchanged between the human and the swarm to afford both cognitive agents with the capacity to form shared understanding and situation awareness, and thus, facilitating effective teaming through trust. An ontology is one formal representational construct that enables bi-directional interpretation, thus, transparency. In this paper, we conceptualise and present a meta-ontology for transparent HST interactions.",,第2页.xls

685,The Effect of Anthropomorphic Design Cues on Increasing Chatbot Empathy,2022,"Empathy is the process of understanding and reacting to other people emotional expressions that involve cognitive and affective aspects. Empathy in education is very important, because service experiences in student academic services that are emotional and generate student affective responses have an influence on student motivation and academic achievement. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) allow computers to gain the ability to express empathy by analyzing and reacting to user emotional expressions via chatbot conversational agents. Chatbots with human-like cues such as their language style can also affect user emotions. In order for chatbots to have human-like cues, it is necessary to apply the concepts in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to chatbots. This research will apply one of the concepts in HCI, called Anthropomorphic Design Cues (ADC). Anthropomorphic is an attribution of human characteristics and behavior that is applied to non-human entities such as animals, plants, or technological devices like chatbot. This study will apply two designs from ADC on chatbots, verbal design and non-verbal design. This study will compare the level of empathy between two chatbots with ADC and without ADC. The results showed that based on the results of statistical tests using the Mann Whitney U Test ADC had a significant p-value of 0.000< 0.05 on chatbot empathy, so it can be concluded that ADC had a significantly positive effect on increasing chatbot empathy.",,第2页.xls

Here, the most important criterion of YowAI-2000 is that it uses only communication by short shouts as seen (or heard) in human soccer play. The main purpose of YowAI-2001 as a research topic in distributed AI is that how far man-like communication can realize cooperation, without using detailed numerical or symbolic information such as absolute coordinate and elaborate plan sequence.

688,Collaborative task support and e-response,2004,"Rather than seeking to automate the tasks performed by humans, the trend in modern AI research and application development is towards providing support to human agents in the workplace. The impetus for this lies in an acknowledgement of the differing capabilities of humans and computers, and its aim is to engineer environments where these capabilities will complement each other to greatest effect. Another influence is the dramatic shift in work practices in recent years, with the rise of the Internet and the Web (and with the semantic Web on the horizon), ensuring that knowledge management has become central to the philosophy of the modern organisation. The I-X programme is typical of this type of modern AI project. Its overall aim is to create an enabling environment for mixed-initiative (i.e., involving both human and computer agents) synthesis tasks. This technology is being put to use in the collaborative advanced knowledge technologies in the grid (CoAKTinG) project, funded by the UK e-Science Programme.

689,Team coordination as a model for multi-agent interaction training,1996,"A model-driven experimental study (TACT, Team Adaptation and Coordination Training) was conducted in which Combat Information Center (CIC) teams are specifically trained to adapt to stress and coordinate their tactical activities accordingly. The central premise for developing recommendations on team training and structuring evolve around the notion of team adaptation. The main hypothesis derived from the premise of team adaptation to stress is that team coordination strategies evolve from explicit coordination under low workload conditions to implicit coordination as workload increases. Hypotheses were tested in the TACT experiment using sixty military officers as participants. The experiment was conducted in a network-based experimental task that simulates operations in a naval CIC environment. A command team of five decision-makers, the Tactical Action Officer and his staff, must coordinate complex, multi-dimensional, and ambiguous information to accomplish the mission prescribed in each scenario. A mixed within/between subject experimental design was used to maximize the diagnosticity of the experimental manipulation. Experimental findings indicate that the TACT training makes a significant difference in improving the teams' performance, especially in conditions of high stress. Further analysis of the data shows that this improvement in tactical outcome is related to a dramatic shift in team coordination and communication strategies, resulting in stronger teamwork skills and adaptive anticipatory behavior on the part on the team members.",,第2页.xls
690,Multi-agent planning under local LTL specifications and event-based synchronization [arXiv],2016,"We study the problem of plan synthesis for multi-agent systems, to achieve complex, high-level, long-term goals that are assigned to each agent individually. As the agents might not be capable of satisfying their respective goals by themselves, requests for other agents collaborations are a part of the task descriptions. We consider that each agent is modeled as a discrete state-transition system and its task specification takes a form of a linear temporal logic formula. A traditional automata-based approach to multi-agent plan synthesis from such specifications builds on centralized team planning and full team synchronization after each agents discrete step, and thus suffers from extreme computational demands. We aim at reducing the computational complexity by decomposing the plan synthesis problem into finite horizon planning problems that are solved iteratively, upon the run of the agents. We introduce an event-based synchronization that allows our approach to efficiently adapt to different time durations of different agents discrete steps. We discuss the correctness of the solution and find assumptions, under which the proposed iterative algorithm leads to provable eventual satisfaction of the desired specifications.",,第2页.xls
691,Multi-robot box-pushing: Single-agent Q-learning vs. team Q-learning,2006,"In this paper, two types of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are employed in a task of multi-robot bog-pushing. The first one is a direct extension of the single-agent Q-learning, which does not have a solid theoretical foundation because it violates the static environment assumption of the Q-learning algorithm. The second one is the Team Q-learning algorithm, which is a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, and is proved to converge to the optimal policy. The states, actions, and reward function of the algorithms are presented in the paper. Based on the two Q-learning algorithms, a fully distributed multi-robot system is developed. Computer simulations are carried out using the developed system. The simulation results show that the two algorithms are effective in a simple environment. It is shown, however, that the single-agent Q-learning algorithm does a better job than the Team Q-learning algorithm in a complicated and unknown environment with many obstacles.",,第2页.xls
692,Reorganizing Complex Network to Improve Large-Scale Multiagent Teamwork,2014,"Large-scale multiagent teamwork has been popular in various domains. Similar to human society infrastructure, agents only coordinate with some of the others, with a peer-to-peer complex network structure. Their organization has been proven as a key factor to influence their performance. To expedite team performance, we have analyzed that there are three key factors. First, complex network effects may be able to promote team performance. Second, coordination interactions coming from their sources are always trying to be routed to capable agents. Although they could be transferred across the network via different paths, their sources and sinks depend on the intrinsic nature of the team which is irrelevant to the network connections. In addition, the agents involved in the same plan often form a subteam and communicate with each other more frequently. Therefore, if the interactions between agents can be statistically recorded, we are able to set up an integrated network adjustment algorithm by combining the three key factors. Based on our abstracted teamwork simulations and the coordination statistics, we implemented the adaptive reorganization algorithm. The experimental results briefly support our design that the reorganized network is more capable of coordinating heterogeneous agents.",,第2页.xls
693,Machine-Assisted Error Discovery in Conversational AI Systems,2024,"Troubles in speaking, hearing, and understanding occur routinely in any kind of conversational setting. The natural flow of conversation includes methods for repairing such troubles by repeating or paraphrasing all or parts of prior turns. In the case of conversational AI systems, these troubles occur due to failure of different components of the system such as the speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. Such errors may occur infrequently, but still often enough to have a significant impact on key performance indicators (KPIs). Identifying the root cause of these errors is a complex task that requires a team to meticulously examine and interpret the interaction between the voice agent and customers.

695,Implementing trading agents for adaptable and evolutive UI-COTS components architectures,2008,"Most of the complex (e-Business) information systems need to accomplish with the use of open standards. Environmental Management Systems (EMS), for instance, state the international regulations of the ISO 14000 family, which establish the requirements to be fulfilled by an EMS in order to be accepted as such. One of these requirements concerns the User Interfaces Development. Because of the variety of final users that interact in this sort of complex information system (politicians, technicians, administrators, and so on) and due to a great deal of information (some critical and confidential), it is important to have real and practical scientific/technical proposals in order to build fast and efficient information exploitation systems. The human-computer interaction (HCI) of these systems need user interfaces that adapt to the users profiles' habits, and with intelligent software agents that mediate by the users in the search processes, exploitation and decision-making tasks. In this work we present a part of the SOLERES-HCI, a framework of the Soleres Project for developing COTS user interfaces by using trading agents. Our studies are being applied for developing advanced EMS and approaching Model-driven engineering techniques to the UI-COTS development.",,第2页.xls
696,A Wizard or a Fool? Initial Assessment of a Wizard of Oz Agent Supporting Collaborative Virtual Environments,2022,"A popular technique for evaluating envisioned AI agents without committing significant engineering resources to implement such an agent is the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) methodology. Thus far, many of the WoZ studies concerned with the design of conversational agents have been standalone systems for individual participants to interact with. The aim of this work was to determine whether aWoZ conversational agent could be embedded within an existing team-based collaborative virtual environment. In doing so, we uncovered a number of potential challenges in designing such a system which may be valuable for those implementing such a system in the future.",,第2页.xls
697,Challenging Human Supremacy: evaluating Monte Carlo Tree Search and Deep Learning for the Trick Taking Card Game Jass,2020,"Despite the recent successful application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to games, the performance of cooperative agents in imperfect information games is still far from surpassing humans. Cooperating with teammates whose play-styles are not previously known poses additional challenges to current state-of-the-art algorithms. In the Swiss card game Jass, coordination within the two opposing teams is crucial for winning. Since verbal communication is forbidden, the only way to transmit information within the team is through a players play-style. This makes the game a particularly suitable candidate subject to continue the research on AI in cooperation games with hidden information. In this work, we analyse the effectiveness and shortcomings of several state-of-the-art algorithms (Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) variants and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)) at playing the Jass game. Our key contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a performance overview for state-of-the-art algorithms, thus, setting a strong foundation for further research on the subject. Second, we implement and open-source (https://gitlab.enterpriselab.ch/jass/info) a platform where different agents (both humans and AI) can play Jass in an automated fashion, effectively reducing the overhead for other researchers who want to perform further experiments.",,第2页.xls
698,Using learning automata in cooperation among agents in a team,2005,"Learning automata act in a stochastic environment and are able to update their action probabilities considering the inputs from their environment, so optimizing their functionality as a result. In this paper, the goal is to investigate and evaluate the application of learning automata to cooperation in multi-agent systems, using soccer simulation server as a test bed. Also, because of the large state space of a complex multi-agent domain, it is vital to have a method for environmental states' generalization. In this paper we have introduced and designed a new technique called the best corner in state square for generalizing the vast number of states in agent's domain environment to a few number of states by building a virtual grid in that environment. The efficiency of this technique in state space generalization in a cooperative multi-agent domain is investigated.",,第2页.xls

RoboCup soccer is a task for a team of fast-moving robots in a dynamic, noisy environment. In order for a robot team to actually perform a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated including: design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning, robotics, and sensor fusion.

700,Using the MOISE+ for a cooperative framework of MAS reorganisation,2004,"Reorganisation within a multi-agent system may be managed by the agents themselves by adapting the organisation to both environmental changes and their own goals. In this paper, we propose an organisation-centred model for controlling this process. Using the MOISE+ organisation model, we are able to define an organisational structure bearing on a reorganisation process along four phases: monitoring (when to reorganise), design (ways of building a new organisation), selection (how to choose an organisation), and implementation (how to change the current running organisation). The proposed reorganisation scheme is evaluated in the robot soccer domain where we have developed players that follow the team organisation specified in MOISE+. A special group of agents may change this organisation, and thus the team behaviour, using reinforcement learning for the selection phase.",,第2页.xls
701,Optimization of task assignment to collaborating agents,2011,"The classic task assignment problem (AP) assigns m agents to n tasks, where each task is assigned to exactly one agent. This problem and many of its variations, including the case where a task is assigned to a group of agents working independently, have been discussed extensively in the literature. We consider a specific class of task assignment problems where each task is assigned to a group of collaborating agents that work as a team. Thus, changing one of the group members may have a vital impact on the output of the group. We assume that each agent has a set of capabilities and each task has certain requirements. The objective is to assign agents to teams such that the gain is maximized. We suggest a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for finding a near optimal solution to this class of task assignment problems. To the best of our knowledge, this class of APs has not been considered in the literature, probably due to the difficulty of evaluating the performance of a team of agents. Recently, we have developed a formal method for measuring performance of a team which is used in this paper to formulate the objective function of our GA. We analyze the quality of the obtained solution by comparing the result of our GA with (a) the exact solution of some smaller problems, and (b) with the results of the exact solution of specific cases that can be obtained by the Hungarian algorithm. We provide experimental results on efficiency, stability, robustness and scalability of the solution obtained by our GA.",,第2页.xls
702,Towards Large Scale Ad-hoc Teamwork,2018,"In complex environments, agents must be able to cooperate with previously unknown team-mates, and hence dynamically learn about other agents in the environment while searching for optimal actions. Previous works employ Monte Carlo Tree Search approaches. However, the search tree increases exponentially with the number of agents, and only scenarios with very small team sizes have been explored. Hence, in this paper we propose a history-based version of UCT Monte Carlo Tree Search, using a more compact representation than the original algorithm. We perform several experiments with a varying number of agents in the level-based foraging domain, an important testbed for ad-hoc teamwork. We achieve better overall performance than the state-of-the-art and better scalability with team size. Additionally, we contribute an open-source version of our system, making it easier for the research community to use the level-based foraging domain as a benchmark problem for ad-hoc teamwork.",,第2页.xls

704,Asimovian multiagents Applying laws of robotics to teams of humans and agents,2007,"In the March 1942 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, Isaac Asimov for the first time enumerated his three laws of robotics. Decades later, researchers in agents and multiagent systems have begun to examine these laws for providing a useful set of guarantees on deployed agent systems. Motivated by unexpected failures or behavior degradations in complex mixed agent-human teams, this paper for the first time focuses on applying Asimov's first two laws to provide behavioral guarantees in such teams. However, operationalizing these laws in the context of such mixed agent-human teams raises three novel issues. First, while the laws were originally written for interaction of an individual robot and an individual human, clearly, our systems must operate in a team context. Second, key notions in these laws (e.g. causing harm to humans) are specified in very abstract terms and must be specified in concrete terms in implemented systems. Third, since removed from science-fiction, agents or humans may not have perfect information about the world, they must act based on these laws despite uncertainty of information. Addressing this uncertainty is a key thrust of this paper, and we illustrate that agents must detect and overcome such states of uncertainty while ensuring adherence to Asimov's laws. We illustrate the results of two different domains that each have different approaches to operationalizing Asimov's laws.",,第2页.xls

In multi agent environments or systems equipped with artificial intelligence it is often difficult to obtain the function or method which led to a particular behavior that is noticeable from outside. In addition to previous dilemma, the publicity that the RoboCup events get from the media provides an ideal opportunity to show the state of art of these systems during RoboCup World Cup.

Multiple agent and planning technology were used to enable the system to critique a human agent's reasoning about multiple agents. This perspective arises naturally whenever a student must learn to lead and coordinate a team of people. The system dynamically selected teaching goals, instantiated plans and modeled the student and the domain as it monitored the student's progress. The tutor provides one of the first complete integrations of a real-time simulation with knowledge-based reasoning. Other novel techniques of the system are reported, such as common-sense reasoning about plans, reasoning about protocol mechanisms, and using a real-time simulation for training.",,第2页.xls
711,Evolution of collective commitment during teamwork,2003,"In this paper we aim to describe dynamic aspects of social and collective attitudes in teams of agents involved in Cooperative Problem Solving (CPS). Particular attention is given to the strongest motivational attitude, collective commitment, and its evolution during team action. First, building on our previous work, a logical framework is sketched in which a number of relevant social and collective attitudes is formalized, leading to the plan-based definition of collective commitments. Moreover, a dynamic logic component is added to this framework in order to capture the effects of the complex actions that are involved in the consecutive stages of CPS, namely potential recognition, team formation, plan formation and team action.During team action, the collective commitment leads to the execution of agent-specific actions. A dynamic and unpredictable environment may, however, cause the failure of some of these actions, or present the agents with new opportunities. The abstract reconfiguration algorithm, presented in a previous paper, is designed to handle the re-planning needed in such situations in an efficient way. In this paper, the dynamic logic component of the logical framework addresses issues pertaining to adjustments in collective commitment during the reconfiguration process.",,第2页.xls

713,An Animated Pedagogical Agent to Support Problem-Based Learning,2013,"Problem-based learning (PBL) is a learning theory that emphasizes collaboration and teamwork to solve a problem. However, a problem that frequently occurs in the implementation of PBL is the presence of passive students who usually have difficulty working in teams or who are unmotivated during the process of teaching and learning. An aspect that can positively influence the implementation process of the PBL is the recommendation of context-sensitive learning objects (LOs). Thus, this paper presents an approach based on an animated pedagogical agent and three other agents for the detection of passive students and for the recommendation of LOs in accordance with the students' context to improve the learning process of PBL.",,第2页.xls

Based on the results of previous work, we address the problem when the graph that models the communication network within the team of the obsrevers is not complete. We propose a hierarchical approach. At the upper level, each observer is allocated to a target through a local minimum cost matching. At the lower level, each observer computes its navigation strategy based on the results of the single observer-single target problem, thereby, decomposing a large multi-agent problem into several 2-agent problems. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy in simulations and experiments.",,第2页.xls
716,Local Coordination in Online Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems,2012,"In cooperative multi-agent systems, group performance often depends more on the interactions between team members, rather than on the performance of any individual agent. Hence, coordination among agents is essential to optimize the group strategy. One solution which is common in the literature is to let the agents learn in a joint action space. Joint Action Learning (JAL) enables agents to explicitly take into account the actions of other agents, but has the significant drawback that the action space in which the agents must learn scales exponentially in the number of agents. Local coordination is a way for a team to coordinate while keeping communication and computational complexity low. It allows the exploitation of a specific dependency structure underlying the problem, such as tight couplings between specific agents. In this paper we investigate a novel approach to local coordination, in which agents learn this dependency structure, resulting in coordination which is beneficial to the group performance. We evaluate our approach in the context of online distributed constraint optimization problems.",,第2页.xls

An important challenge to the scientific community is to develop, validate and apply theories and models to help managers re-engineer their organizations for higher levels of performance.

724,Minimalism+distribution=supermodularity,1997,"We have designed and implemented multi-agent strategies for manipulation tasks by distributing mechanically-based sequential algorithms across several autonomous spatially-separated agents, such as mobile robots. Our experience using mobile robots for the manipulation of large objects (couches, boxes, file cabinets, etc.) leads us to recommend a minimalist architecture for multi-agent programming. In particular, our methodology has led us to derive asynchronous distributed strategies that require no direct communication between agents, and very sparse geometric and dynamic models of the objects our robots manipulate. We argue for a design principle called supermodularity, which is orthogonal both to the notion of modularity in cognitive AI and also to horizontal decomposition (the non-modularity advocated in the subsumption/connectionist literature). Finally, we discuss a simple mobot-scheme infrastructure to implement supermodular architectures. In the past few years we have programmed many supermodular manipulation protocols and tested them extensively on our team of mobile robots. We describe why we think the supermodular infrastructure results in robust, simple, readable, manipulation strategies that can be recycled and reused.",,第2页.xls

726,Communication during learning in heterogeneous teams of learning agents,2008,"The objective of this work is to determine how/if learning agents can benefit from exchanging information during learning in problems where each team uses a different learning algorithm. In recent studies several problems were exposed, such as lack of coordination, exchange of useless information and difficulties in the adequate choice of advisors. In this work we propose new solutions and test them in two different domains (predator-prey and traffic-control). Our solutions involve hybrid algorithms derived from Q-Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms. Results indicate that some combinations of learning algorithms are more suited to the use of external information than others and that the difference in the results achieved, with and without communication, is problem dependent. The results also show that, in situations where communication is useful, the gain in quality and learning-time can be significant if the right combination of techniques is used to process external information.",,第2页.xls

One of the current challenges in building collective intelligence systems is to seamlessly integrate AI agents in them, transforming traditional collective intelligence to human-machine collective intelligence. The paper describes an approach to address two cornerstone problems of human-machine collective intelligence - interoperability in hybrid teams and sustaining the degree of self-organization required to address complex problems. To solve the first problem, it is proposed to leverage the expressiveness of ontologies and the technology of ontology-based smart spaces. To address the second one, a concept of assisted self-organization is proposed, including a method to assist in team-formation and a method to detect and resolve non-productive situations in the collective work.",,第2页.xls

The problem in which the leader is steered towards a target position while the followers create and maintain a formation about the leader, while avoiding collisions, is posed as a nonlinear differential game. Dynamic strategies which approximate the solution to the differential game are constructed. It is shown that for the case in which collisions are not considered the problem simplifies to a linear-quadratic differential game, for which approximate solutions are identified. These approximate solutions are well-suited for situations in which the agents do not have full information regarding the positions of all members of the team. Simulations illustrate the results for both the linear-quadratic and the nonlinear problems.",,第2页.xls

In this paper, I focus on agents' intentions as the building block that abstracts local situations of the agent, and proposes a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HMM). The key of the proposed model is introduction of gate probabilities that restrict transition among agents' intentions according to others' intentions. Using these probabilities, the framework can control transitions flexibly among basic behaviors in a cooperative behavior. Experiments shows that the model can acquire suitable timing to change agent's intention cooperatively with other agents.",,第2页.xls
733,Architecture of an agent-based negotiation mechanism,2002,"One of the central issues in facilitating mobile teamwork is the creation and establishment of teams from autonomous agents. It is widely accepted that team building assumes an expression of and agreement on, common interests. This paper describes a new approach to the provision of mechanisms to facilitate the creation of teams and to help resolve conflict through automated negotiation. The negotiation mechanism is implemented by a combination of a game theory approach and a co-evolutionary approach. This scheme involves a process that iterates over the generation of a set of strategies by the co-evolutionary approach, the encoding of these strategies into a payoff matrix, and the reasoning on the matrix by the game theory approach in order to find an optimised point. The process terminates when the game theory approach finds an optimised point that satisfies both agents. The main advantage of this system is that agents, without knowing each other's strategies, agree on an optimised solution that conforms to Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficiency.",,第2页.xls

737,A Meta-Model for Studying the Coevolution of Knowledge and Collaboration Networks,2011,"Guimera and his colleagues proposed an interesting modelto study the evolution of collaboration networks, in which the creative teams are the basic building blocks of the collaboration network and the network grows by repetitively assimilating new teams. We argue that one limitation of this GUSA model is that the intrinsic mutual influence of the collaboration network and the collective production and diffusion of knowledge in the network is largely neglected. Based on this argumentation, we in this paper propose an abstract meta-model that extends and generalizes the GUSA model in order to study the evolutionary dynamics of collaboration networks with the team assembly mechanism. By integrating the mechanism of team-wide knowledge production and diffusion, the proposed meta-model provides a unified framework to simultaneously study knowledge dynamics and structural evolution of the network. In tune with the proposed meta-model, an agent-based modeling framework is briefly discussed.",,第2页.xls

We examine the effect that an individual's personality has on his or her willingness to: (1) seek assistance from and/or (2) accept the recommendations of an automated teammate. We use a game of pure strategy with a perfectly accurate decision-assisting automated agent to examine how personality predicts these interactions. Forty-nine participants played 3 rounds of a decision game called Pirate Island. Each participant made 27 total decisions (9 decisions per round over 3 rounds) and had the option to solicit assistance from an automated agent for each decision. Participants were not told that the agent was 100% accurate, only that it could help them. We found that people low on extroversion and high on agreeableness were highly correlated to soliciting recommendations from an agent. However, only those high on agreeableness actually accepted recommendations.",,第2页.xls
740,Managing SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Schools with an Artificial Intelligence Model and Application Developed by Simulation Data,2021,"Research on SARS-CoV-2 and its social implications have become a major focus to interdisciplinary teams worldwide. As interest in more direct solutions, such as mass testing and vaccination grows, several studies appear to be dedicated to the operationalization of those solutions, leveraging both traditional and new methodologies, and, increasingly, the combination of both. This research examines the challenges anticipated for preventative testing of SARS-CoV-2 in schools and proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agent-based model crafted specifically for school scenarios. This research shows that in the absence of real data, simulation-based data can be used to develop an artificial intelligence model for the application of rapid assessment of school testing policies.",,第2页.xls
741,Programming a multi-agent system with MASL,2008,"Expressing the general behaviour of a set of robots working together is a difficult task. Self reconfigurable robots or a team of robots playing football are examples of such problem. To control a set of homogeneous or heterogeneous robotic components, one needs to express synchronous and asynchronous computation, from a local or a global point of view. In this paper we propose a unique language to express the behaviour of a set of heterogeneous robots.",,第2页.xls
742,Interference Management Mechanisms and Socio-cognitive Constructs in Cooperative Relationships,2011,"Collaboration tools are increasingly being used to allow distributed agents/individuals or teams to interact effectively to perform some tasks and achieve some goals. There have been many research efforts in providing comprehensive treatment of cooperation in teams or socio-technical systems. With a multi-disciplinary approach based on human factors research, organization studies, and artificial intelligence findings, this paper offers a conceptual framework in which cooperation and other social relationships can be defined in terms of the fundamental concepts of goal fit, intentionality, motivation, interference, and dependence. It is shown that social relationships are established and sustained by means of particular interaction mechanisms used for interference management, as well as socio-cognitive constructs that emerge from and feed these interactions. This framework can be used to determine the level of cooperation between different individuals or teams for a given task and therefore be used to better inform the requirements of the collaborative tools designed for them.",,第2页.xls
743,Collaboration based on hierarchical relationship,2003,"In this paper, we present a technique for the collaboration among the members of computer generated action team in the virtual environment. We research a multiagent model in artificial intelligence and put our emphases on the structure of the team members. We analyze the hierarchical relationship among team members in the real world and apply it to computer generated team. In this approach, we present a hierarchical collaboration model based on the planned team activity model. The hierarchical relationship among the team members is organized as a hierarchical tree and each member of the team maintains this relationship. To maintain the hierarchical relationship, this paper also gives some atom rules and functions to adapt the dynamic environment. Using our improved model, the team can work effectively and dynamically in real time. The result shows that by using the hierarchical model the collaboration among the team members in the virtual environments is improved.",,第2页.xls

The agents are organised into a team for a specific task which has a task manager role assigned to one of the agents. When the task is complete the team is disbanded. This framework is termed shifting matrix management (SMM). With this organisation, agents are grouped by joint intentions, organised in a manager-contractor manner. The agent acts under a commitment and convention to achieve cooperative, coherent task performance. The actual experiments suggest the rationality of the framework.",,第2页.xls

Collaboration requires communication, but it may happen that it could not be established for some reason. In this context, members of the herd have to make decisions on its own, trying to do the best for the group.

746,Capability-based task allocation in emergency-response environments: a coalition-formation approach,2013,"This paper addresses coalition formation, based on agent capabilities, centered on task allocation in emergency-response environments (EREs). EREs are environments that need fast task completion as their main requirement. We propose a team-based organization model, based on an existing organization model for adaptive complex systems. The model has some key characteristics that are beneficial for EREs: agents act in dynamic, open domains; agents collaborate in completing group tasks; agents may have similar types of capabilities, but at different levels; tasks need different agent capabilities, at collective different levels; and agents are supervised in a partially decentralized manner. We formulate task allocation as a capability-based coalition-formation problem, propose a greedy myopic algorithm to form coalitions, and compare it with F-Max-Sum, another efficient myopic algorithm. Experiments in which utility is measured show that the capability-based approach outperforms the role-based one. The numerical experiments suggest that the proposed task allocation method is possibly scalable with growing numbers of agents.",,第2页.xls
747,Collaborative learning agent for promoting group interaction,2006,"This project aims to design and develop a prototype for an agent that support online collaborative learning. Online collaborative learning, which has emerged as a new form of education in the knowledge-based society, is regarded as an effective method for improving practical and highly advanced problem-solving abilities. Collaborative learning involves complicated processes, such as organizing teams, setting common goals, performing tasks, and evaluating the outcome of team activities. Thus, a teacher may have difficulty promoting and evaluating the entire process of collaborative learning, and a system may need to be developed to support it. Therefore, to promote interaction among learners in the process of collaborative learning, this study designed an extensible collaborative learning agent (ECOLA) for an online learning environment.",,第2页.xls

The method is a role centred one, where agents collaborate to assist human users through interaction within the same role. with other roles of the same team, as well as roles of different teams that share tasks dependencies: these agents are also dynamic within the role, they can join and/or leave the coalitions. We identify the key elements of the role model as rules. agents, and relationships.

750,A Model of Command Behavior of Agents in a Qualitative Semiotic Environment. Part 1. A Qualitative Functioning Environment. Basic Definitions and Statement of the Problem,2018,"The mathematical model of the formation and functioning of a team of artificial intelligence agents with BDI architecture in a qualitative semiotic (sign) environment of functioning is considered in the work. As the basis of the mathematical model of the environment of functioning, the model of the Group of robots-Environment multi-agent dynamic system was chosen. A method for structuring the environment of functioning in the form of a partially ordered set of embedded subspaces of the state space of a dynamical system and a method for symbolizing the classes of states by symbol names that define these classes are proposed. Such a structure is defined as a qualitative conceptual framework of the environment and is called the semiotic environment of functioning. In terms of a qualitative semiotic functioning environment, a mathematical model of an intelligent agent with a BDI architecture is proposed and the conditions for the formation and functioning of teams of intelligent agents in this environment are formulated.",,第2页.xls
751,Hierarchical organizations for real-time large-scale task and team environments,2002,"The paper considers the problem of managing large collections of dynamically changing tasks, distributed over large geographic areas, by very large teams of mobile and cooperative agents that have direct access to only local information about their immediate environment. We are particularly interested in problem domains in which scalability, fault tolerance and real-time behavior are a central concern. There are several domains where such problems arise. In such domains, there are three important issues that represent prerequisites for success: (i) how the agents should be distributed over the area, (ii) how agents should process local information, derived from possibly noisy sensors, to provide a partial solution to nearby tasks, and (iii) how partial solutions should be integrated into a global solution. We developed the distributed dispatcher model (DDM), an agent based computational model of semi-centralized task allocation. DDM is designed for efficient coordinated task allocation in systems consisting of hundreds of agents (resources); the model makes use of hierarchical group formation to restrict the degree of communication between agents necessary for coordination.",,第2页.xls
752,Multi-agent Coordination for Data Gathering with Periodic Requests and Deliveries,2019,"In this demo work we develop a method to plan and coordinate a multi-agent team to gather information on demand. The data is periodically requested by a static Operation Center (OC) from changeable goals locations. The mission of the team is to reach these locations, taking measurements and delivering the data to the OC. Due to the limited communication range as well as signal attenuation because of the obstacles, the agents must travel to the OC, to upload the data. The agents can play two roles: ones as workers gathering data, the others as collectors traveling invariant paths for collecting the data of the workers to re-transmit it to the OC. The refreshing time of the delivered information depends on the number of available agents as well as of the scenario. The proposed algorithm finds out the best balance between the number of collectors-workers and the partition of the scenario into working areas in the planning phase, which provides the minimum refreshing time and will be the one executed by the agents.",,第2页.xls
753,That's (not) the output I expected! On the role of end user expectations in creating explanations of AI systems,2021,"Research in the social sciences has shown that expectations are an important factor in explanations as used between humans: rather than explaining the cause of an event per se, the explainer will often address another event that did not occur but that the explainee might have expected. For AI-powered systems, this finding suggests that explanation-generating systems may need to identify such end user expectations. In general, this is a challenging task, not the least because users often keep them implicit; there is thus a need to investigate the importance of such an ability.In this paper, we report an empirical study with 181 participants who were shown outputs from a text classifier system along with an explanation of why the system chose a particular class for each text. Explanations were both factual, explaining why the system produced a certain output or counterfactual, explaining why the system produced one output instead of another. Our main hypothesis was explanations should align with end user expectations; that is, a factual explanation should be given when the system's output is in line with end user expectations, and a counterfactual explanation when it is not.We find that factual explanations are indeed appropriate when expectations and output match. When they do not, neither factual nor counterfactual explanations appear appropriate, although we do find indications that our counterfactual explanations contained at least some necessary elements. Overall, this suggests that it is important for systems that create explanations of AI systems to infer what outputs the end user expected so that factual explanations can be generated at the appropriate moments. At the same time, this information is, by itself, not sufficient to also create appropriate explanations when the output and user expectations do not match. This is somewhat surprising given investigations of explanations in the social sciences, and will need more scrutiny in future studies. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.",,第2页.xls
754,Disaster world Decision-theoretic agents for simulating population responses to hurricanes,2023,"Artificial intelligence (AI) research provides a rich source of modeling languages capable of generating socially plausible simulations of human behavior, while also providing a transparent ground truth that can support validation of social-science methods applied to that simulation. In this work, we leverage two established AI representations: decision-theoretic planning and recursive modeling. Decision-theoretic planning (specifically Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) provides agents with quantitative models of their corresponding real-world entities' subjective (and possibly incorrect) perspectives of ground truth in the form of probabilistic beliefs and utility functions. Recursive modeling gives an agent a theory of mind, which is necessary when a person's (again, possibly incorrect) subjective perspectives are of another person, rather than of just his/her environment. We used PsychSim, a multiagent social-simulation framework combining these two AI frameworks, to build a general parameterized model of human behavior during disaster response, grounding the model in social-psychological theories to ensure social plausibility. We then instantiated that model into alternate ground truths for simulating population response to a series of natural disasters, namely, hurricanes. The simulations generate data in response to socially plausible instruments (e.g., surveys) that serve as input to the Ground Truth program's designated research teams for them to conduct simulated social science. The simulation also provides a graphical ground truth and a set of outcomes to be used as the gold standard in evaluating the research teams' inferences.",,第2页.xls
755,Voice in Human-Agent Interaction: A Survey,2021,"Social robots, conversational agents, voice assistants, and other embodied AI are increasingly a feature of everyday life. What connects these various types of intelligent agents is their ability to interact with people through voice. Voice is becoming an essential modality of embodiment, communication, and interaction between computer-based agents and end-users. This survey presents a meta-synthesis on agent voice in the design and experience of agents from a human-centered perspective: voice-based human-agent interaction (vHAI). Findings emphasize the social role of voice in HAI as well as circumscribe a relationship between agent voice and body, corresponding to human models of social psychology and cognition. Additionally, changes in perceptions of and reactions to agent voice over time reveals a generational shift coinciding with the commercial proliferation of mobile voice assistants. The main contributions of this work are a vHAI classification framework for voice across various agent forms, contexts, and user groups, a critical analysis grounded in key theories, and an identification of future directions for the oncoming wave of vocal machines.",,第2页.xls
756,Calibrating trust to integrate intelligent agents into human teams,1998,"Complex team tasks, such as joint operation planning, require that information and resources from distributed sources be exchanged and fused because no one individual dual or service has the collective expertise, information, or resources required. We are at the beginning of a major research program aimed at effectively incorporating intelligent agents into human reams. Our initial experiments use a low fidelity simulation of a target identification task, TANDEM, to investigate human-agent interaction for individual operators and human teams. In the TANDEM simulation subjects identify and choose an appropriate response to a series of air, surface, or submarine targets. Subjects perform a sequence of time critical information gathering and communications tasks in order to decide whether to shoot or clear each target. The data necessary to make a correct decision is distributed among human and in our experiments software agents. Subjects must communicate, coordinate, and negotiate with one another and their agents in order to amass the information needed to classify and dispose of each target. The most transparent presentation led to the best performance and greatest reliance on the simulated agent.",,第2页.xls
757,Predicting Operators' Fatigue in a Human in the Artificial Intelligence Loop for Defect Detection in Manufacturing,2023,"Quality inspection, typically performed manually by workers in the past, is now rapidly switching to automated solutions, using artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods. This elevates the job function of the quality inspection team from the physical inspection tasks to tasks related to managing workflows in synergy with AI agents, for example, interpreting inspection outcomes or labeling inspection image data for the AI models. In this context, we have studied how defect inspection can be enhanced, providing defect hints to the operator to ease defect identification. Furthermore, we developed machine learning models to recognize and predict operators' fatigue. By doing so, we can proactively take mitigation actions to enhance the workers' well-being and ensure the highest defect inspection quality standards. We consider such processes to empower human and non-human actors in manufacturing and the sociotechnical production system. The paper first outlines the conceptual approach for integrating the operator in the AI-driven quality inspection process while implementing a fatigue monitoring system to enhance work conditions. Furthermore, it describes how this was implemented by leveraging data and experiments performed for a real-world manufacturing use case. Copyright (c) 2023 The Authors.",,第2页.xls
758,Human error modeling in computer-generated forces: a team coordination analysis tool,2003,"Understanding interactions among team members is critical for developing effective team-level training systems and for designing responsive decision support technologies. Communications among team members under exposure to various stressors is a research area that has received substantial experimental attention. Sustained access to human subjects, though, poses problems given the great demands on skilled practitioners' time. An approach to reducing reliance on human subjects while creating flexible research opportunities is to create a suite of human behavioral models, each representing a member of a team, and expose those models to various sources of stress in order to observe the response of each model and the overall patterns of team behavior. We present results of a preliminary effort in adopting this approach using Team Interaction Analysis with Reusable Agents (TIARA), an implementation platform for modeling interactive behaviors and human decision processes in stressful conditions. The current instantiation of TIARA models mission crew positions within the E2-C airborne early warning aircraft and allows for variable proficiency levels in one crew member. We describe our framework for controlling various stressors confronting the simulated crew and summarize our preliminary analysis of team behaviors and communication patterns arising from (1) the presence of those stressors; and (2) proficiency of the variable crew member.",,第2页.xls
759,Learning Multi-Agent Cooperation via Considering Actions of Teammates,2024,"Recently value-based centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved excellent performance in cooperative tasks. However, the most representative method among these methods, Q-network MIXing (QMIX), restricts the joint action Q values to be a monotonic mixing of each agent ' s utilities. Furthermore, current methods cannot generalize to unseen environments or different agent configurations, which is known as ad hoc team play situation. In this work, we propose a novel Q values decomposition that considers both the return of an agent acting on its own and cooperating with other observable agents to address the nonmonotonic problem. Based on the decomposition, we propose a greedy action searching method that can improve exploration and is not affected by changes in observable agents or changes in the order of agents ' actions. In this way, our method can adapt to ad hoc team play situation. Furthermore, we utilize an auxiliary loss related to environmental cognition consistency and a modified prioritized experience replay (PER) buffer to assist training. Our extensive experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements in both challenging monotonic and nonmonotonic domains, and can handle the ad hoc team play situation perfectly.",,第2页.xls
760,"A Bayesian Formulation for Auction Based Task Allocation in Heterogeneous, Multi-Agent Teams",2011,"In distributed, heterogeneous, multi-agent teams, agents may have different capabilities and types of sensors. Agents in dynamic environments will need to cooperate in real-time to perform tasks with minimal costs. Some example scenarios include dynamic allocation of UAV and UGV robot teams to possible hurricane survivor locations, search and rescue and target detection.Auction based algorithms scale well because agents generally only need to communicate bid information. In addition, the agents are able to perform their computations in parallel and can operate on local information. Furthermore, it is easy to integrate humans and other vehicle types and sensor combinations into an auction framework. However, standard auction mechanisms do not explicitly consider sensors with varying reliability.The agents sensor qualities should be explicitly accounted. Consider a scenario with multiple agents, each carrying a single sensor. The tasks in this case are to simply visit a location and detect a target. The sensors are of varying quality, with some having a higher probability of target detection. The agents themselves may have different capabilities, as well. The agents use knowledge of their environment to submit cost-based bids for performing each task and an auction is used to perform the task allocation. This paper discusses techniques for including a Bayesian formulation of target detection likelihood into this auction based framework for performing task allocation across multi-agent heterogeneous teams. Analysis and results of experiments with multiple air systems performing distributed target detection are also included.",,第2页.xls
761,Exploring Agent Physicality and Social Presence for Medical Team Training,2013,"Mixed reality and 3D user interface technologies have increased the immersion, presence, and physicality of user interactions. These technologies can also increase the physicality of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) by making the ECAs occupy and interact with the physical space. We propose that increasing the physicality of an ECA can increase the ECA's social presence, that is, the feeling that the ECA is a real person. In this paper, we examine existing research and formalize the idea of ECA physicality. We also explored the relationship between physicality and social presence by conducting two user studies (n = 18 and n = 29). Both user studies took place in a medical team training context and involved virtual human ECAs as fellow team members. The first study's results suggested that increasing physicality increased social presence and elicited more realistic behavior. The second study's results suggested that individual dimensions of physicality affect social presence to different extents.",,第2页.xls
762,Using a Team of General AI Algorithms to Assist Game Design and Testing,2018,"General Video Game Playing (GVGP) has become a popular line of research in the past years, leading to the existence of a wide range of general algorithms created to tackle this challenge. This paper proposes taking advantage of this research to help in game design and testing processes. It introduces a methodology consisting of using a team of Artificial General Intelligence agents with differentiated goals (winning, exploring, collecting items, killing NPCs, etc.) and skill levels. Using several agents with distinct behaviours that play the same game simultaneously can provide substantial information to influence design and bug fixing. Two methods are proposed to aid game design: 1) the evaluation of a game based on the expected performance in the behaviour of each of the agents, and 2) the provision of visual information to analyse how the experience of the agents evolves during the play-through. Having this methodology available to designers can help them decide if the game or level under analysis fits the initial expectations. Including a Logging System can also be used to detect anomalies while the development is still at an early stage. We believe this approach allows the flexibility and portability to be easily applied to games with different characteristics.",,第2页.xls

764,Intermittent Connectivity for Exploration in Communication-Constrained Multi-Agent Systems,2020,"Motivated by exploration of communication-constrained underground environments using robot teams, we study the problem of planning for intermittent connectivity in multi-agent systems. We propose a novel concept of information-consistency to handle situations where the plan is not initially known by all agents, and suggest an integer linear program for synthesizing information-consistent plans that also achieve auxiliary goals. Furthermore, inspired by network flow problems we propose a novel way to pose connectivity constraints that scales much better than previous methods. In the second part of the paper we apply these results in an exploration setting, and propose a clustering method that separates a large exploration problem into smaller problems that can be solved independently. We demonstrate how the resulting exploration algorithm is able to coordinate a team of ten agents to explore a large environment.",,第2页.xls
765,Balancing Two-Player Stochastic Games with Soft Q-Learning [arXiv],2018,"Within the context of video games the notion of perfectly rational agents can be undesirable as it leads to uninteresting situations, where humans face tough adversarial decision makers. Current frameworks for stochastic games and reinforcement learning prohibit tuneable strategies as they seek optimal performance. In this paper, we enable such tuneable behaviour by generalising soft Q-learning to stochastic games, where more than one agent interact strategically. We contribute both theoretically and empirically. On the theory side, we show that games with soft Q-learning exhibit a unique value and generalise team games and zero-sum games far beyond these two extremes to cover a continuous spectrum of gaming behaviour. Experimentally, we show how tuning agents' constraints affect performance and demonstrate, through a neural network architecture, how to reliably balance games with high-dimensional representations.",,第2页.xls

Most deep network based agent-modeling approaches are 1) not interpretable and 2) only model external behavior, ignoring internal mental states, which potentially limits their capability for assistance, interventions, discovering false beliefs, etc. To this end, we develop an interpretable modular neural framework for modeling the intentions of other observed entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with experiments on data from human participants on a search and rescue task in Minecraft, and show that incorporating interpretability can significantly increase predictive performance under the right conditions.",,第2页.xls

It was shown that choice-shift often occurred under conformity when the responsibility was decentralized. This shift would not occur if the proportion of the radical was small and the deciding process would fall into dystocia when the effect of the radical's influence offset the advantage of the number of the conservatives.

This requires the design of efficient collaboration protocols, a typical example of which is team formation. In this paper, we illustrate how probabilistic model checking, a technique for formal verification of probabilistic systems, can be applied to the analysis, design and verification of such protocols. We start by analysing the performance of an existing team formation protocol modelled as a discrete-time Markov chain. Then, using a Markov decision process model, we construct optimal algorithms for team formation.

A multi-agent approachis proposed in order to support distributed partners in the creation of coherent models for engineering analysis. A granular modelling process is proposed to ensure a coherent construction of models and their analysis. It consists of a global and a local analysis based on a networked product life cycle (PLC). A set of 'tutor agents' (TA) intends to guide each partner to extract relevant information from his/her technical domain while a 'standardisation process' (SP) is performed with supplied information to find potential redundancies. A coherent model is then obtained that is ready to be analysed by traditional inference engines such as optimisation solvers and constraint satisfaction programming. Furthermore, a case will be presented in order to clarify the framework. The results will enable design teams to integrate constraints from throughout the PLC in order to optimise the evolution of design concepts in distributed design.",,第2页.xls

The pedagogy that we adopted here is computer-based active learning: teams of students are presented with well-defined assignments aimed at building intelligent agents for person identification and recognition of facial expressions and emotions from video recordings of their faces. Classroom experience indicates that the students found the specified programming assignments highly motivating. Objective evaluation studies suggest that students learn much more effectively when a contextualized, collaborative, constructive, and reflective approach is used than when an orthodox, objectivist approach to teaching ML and AI techniques is used alone.",,第2页.xls
778,From Communication to Collaboration: Simulating the Emergence of Inter-organizational Collaboration Network,2010,"Inter-organizational networks often have multiple dimensions, each one denoting a type of relationship. In this research, we studied how one dimension of the network, a collaboration network, emerges from organizations' interaction on another dimension--the communication network. We modeled the emergence of collaboration as an event-based multi-agent team formation process that incorporates the structure of the underlying communication network, the diffusion of project information, and network-based influence. As a case study, we used an agent-based simulation to study the collaboration among humanitarian organizations. We also analyzed how changes to the communication network among humanitarian organizations affect their collaboration network. The experiment results suggest that different strategies to promote communication may have positive or negative impacts on the future collaboration network.",,第2页.xls
779,AI as a moral crumple zone: The effects of AI-mediated communication on attribution and trust,2020,"AI-mediated communication (AI-MC) represents a new paradigm where communication is augmented or generated by an intelligent system. As AI-MC becomes more prevalent, it is important to understand the effects that it has on human interactions and interpersonal relationships. Previous work tells us that in human interactions with intelligent systems, misattribution is common and trust is developed and handled differently than in interactions between humans. This study uses a 2 (successful vs. unsuccessful conversation) x 2 (standard vs. AI-mediated messaging app) between subjects design to explore whether AI mediation has any effects on attribution and trust. We show that the presence of AI-generated smart replies serves to increase perceived trust between human communicators and that, when things go awry, the AI seems to be perceived as a coercive agent, allowing it to function like a moral crumple zone and lessen the responsibility assigned to the other human communicator. These findings suggest that smart replies could be used to improve relationships and perceptions of conversational outcomes between interlocutors. Our findings also add to existing literature regarding perceived agency in smart agents by illustrating that in this type of AI-MC, the AI is considered to have agency only when communication goes awry.

780,An e-Groupware based on multi agents systems for knowledge management,2007,"This article presents a knowledge management experiment in a company of four hundred employees. Our researches concerns the development of a MAS associated to e-Groupware in order to build project memories. In SMEs, the development of a product requires a multidisciplinary team where professional actors work together to achieve the same goal. In this collaborative world we observe many exchanges (engineering data, report...) and interactions (meetings, decisions...). Each of these types of communication is at the origin of the emergent knowledge. Consequently we propose an approach based upon the modelling of activities with an organizational meta-model and the use of MAS to trace knowledge and automatically build project memories.",,第2页.xls
781,Learning to select negotiation strategies in Multi-Agent Meeting Scheduling,2005,"In this paper, we look at the Multi-Agent Meeting Scheduling problem where distributed agents negotiate meeting times on behalf of their users. While many negotiation approaches have been proposed for scheduling meetings, it is not well understood how agents can negotiate strategically in order to maximize their users' utility. To negotiate strategically, agents need to learn to pick good strategies for negotiating with other agents. We show how the playbook approach, introduced by [1] for team plan selection in small-size robot soccer, can be used to select strategies. Selecting strategies in this way gives some theoretical guarantees about regret. We also show experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.",,第2页.xls
782,A knowledge-based component for human-robot teamwork,2008,"Teams of humans and robots pose a new challenge to teamwork. This stems from the fact that robots and humans have significantly different perceptual, reasoning, communication and actuation capabilities. This paper contributes to solving this problem by proposing a knowledge-based multi-agent system to support design and execution of stereotyped (i.e. recurring) human-robot teamwork. The cooperative workflow formalism has been selected to specify team plans, and adapted to allow activities to share structured data, in a frequent basis, while executing. This novel functionality enables tightly coupled interactions among team members. Rather than focusing on automatic teamwork planning, this paper proposes a complementary and intuitive knowledge-based solution for fast deployment and adaptation of small scale human-robot teams. In addition, the system has been designed in order to provide information about the mission status, contributing this way to the human overall mission awareness problem. A set of empirical results obtained from simulated and real missions demonstrates the capabilities of the system.",,第2页.xls

In this system, software developers work side by side on the program project and coding forming a pairing session. To mediate the team member's participation, the system counts on the help of Intelligent Agents for Verifying the Relevance of Comments and Identifiers (Agents that parse comments and identifiers on the produced source-code, intervening whenever necessary questioning irrelevant comments and identifiers) and Intelligent agents of mediation (agents that evaluate the amount and relevance of forum and chat messages posted during a pairing session, intervening whenever necessary questioning the pair participation on the session's discussion topics).",,第2页.xls
784,Some people aren't worth listening to: periodically retraining classifiers with feedback from a team of end users [arXiv],2020,"Document classification is ubiquitous in a business setting, but often the end users of a classifier are engaged in an ongoing feedback-retrain loop with the team that maintain it. We consider this feedback-retrain loop from a multi-agent point of view, considering the end users as autonomous agents that provide feedback on the labelled data provided by the classifier. This allows us to examine the effect on the classifier's performance of unreliable end users who provide incorrect feedback. We demonstrate a classifier that can learn which users tend to be unreliable, filtering their feedback out of the loop, thus improving performance in subsequent iterations.",,第2页.xls

There are a number of important motivations for developing robotic teams of cooperating modules. Differences in task requirements, resources and environments provide a very strong motivation not to attempt to develop a single complicated robotic system which performs all functions, in all conditions, poorly. Consideration of multiple cooperative robotic teams, provide an attractive, effective and practical alternative. Individual robots in the team are typically simpler to design, enhancing the system reliability. Also, teams are more efficient and more fault-tolerant.

An agent based solution,2001,"In this paper, the first in a two-part series, we explore an agent based solution approach to the multiperiod design of azeotropic separation systems. Asynchronous Teams (A-Teams). a software organization that has been successfully applied to combinatorial optimization problems in other disciplines, is applied to this chemical process system design problem. A-Teams is a framework in which multiple design techniques can work harmoniously in the solution of a problem too demanding for any one method. We introduce a simple architecture for constructing A-Teams that incorporates the use of persistent data. Several approaches for generating improved multiperiod azeotropic design solutions are developed and are used simultaneously in a large-scale demonstration. The software organization is found to be capable of developing and improving a population of preliminary designs for the multiperiod azeotropic design problem. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The method is based on the results of studies on models of artificial life and a biological analogy (hypertext representation as a model for artificial biological organism habitat) of a searching agent, whose main resource is the energy contained within relevant documents. Based on the method developed, new algorithms are constructed and studied that use evolutional adaptation mechanisms for relevant information search. Evolutionary and combined methods are presented for searching agent training in an MA-system.

We present a technique to verify multi-agent systems based on inductive reasoning. Induction allows to derive general rules from specific examples (e.g. the inputs and outputs of software systems). Using inductive logic programming, partial declarative specifications of the software can be induced. These rules can be readily interpreted by the designers or users of the software, and can in turn result in changes to the software. The approach outlined was used to test the KULRoT RoboCup simulator team, which is briefly described.",,第2页.xls
790,Impact of Contradicting Subtle Emotion Cues on Large Language Models with Various Prompting Techniques,2024,"The landscape of human-machine interaction is undergoing a transformation with the integration of conversational technologies. In various domains, Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots are progressively taking on roles traditionally handled by human agents, such as task execution, answering queries, offering guidance, and delivering social and emotional assistance. Consequently, enhancing user satisfaction with these technologies is crucial for their effective incorporation. Emotions indeed play an effective role in responses generated by reinforcement-learning-based chatbots. In text-based prompts, emotions can be signaled by visual (emojis, emoticons) and linguistic (misspellings, tone of voice, word choice, sentence length, similes) aspects. Therefore, researchers are harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing techniques to imbue chatbots with emotional intelligence capabilities. This research aims to explore the impact of feeding contradicting emotional cues to the LLMs through different prompting techniques. The evaluation is based on specified instructions versus provided emotional signals. Each prompting technique is scrutinized by inducing a variety of emotions on widely used LLMs, ChatGPT 3.5 and Gemini. Instead of automating the prompting process, the prompts are given by exerting cognitive load to be more realistic regarding Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The responses are evaluated using human-provided qualitative insights. The results indicate that simile-based cues have the highest impact in both ChatGPT and Gemini. However, results also conclude that the Gemini is more sensitive towards emotional cues. The finding of this research can benefit multiple fields: HCI, AI Development, Natural Language Processing, Prompt Engineering, Psychology, and Emotion analysis.",,第2页.xls

Utility functions are used for estimating how well suited a robot is for a certain role.

792,An adaptive network model simulating the effects of an AI coach on supporting safety in hospitals through inducing adherence to guidelines in neonatal medical protocols,2024,"In this article, it is shown how second-order adaptive agent-based network models can be used to support a medical team in healthcare institutions to adhere to specific Neonatal Hypoglycemia and Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia treatment guidelines through the integration of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Virtual Coach. The proposed AI Coach is designed to provide timely interventions and correct deviations when lapses in the health care practitioner's internal mental model occur. Through simulating three different scenarios, the internal dynamics of these mental models, adaptive changes of these mental models (learning and forgetting), and the interaction between health care practitioners and the world is shown when: (1) There is perfect adherence to guidelines, (2) There is imperfect adherence to guidelines and (3) There is both perfect and imperfect adherence to guidelines alongside interventions of the AI Coach in the latter case.",,第2页.xls

We illustrate the architecture of an agent-mediated collaborative system-the agent-buddy system that can create a sense of group presence and, at the same time, preserve the privacy of each user. Virtual springs systems are used to model the awareness degrees among team members. Each agent makes decisions by considering multiple factors.

794,Effects of Reliance Support on Team Performance by Advising and Adaptive Autonomy,2011,"Problems with estimating trust in information sources are common in time constraining and ambiguous situations and often lead to a decrease of team performance. Humans lack the resources to track the integrity of information and thus tend to over- or under-rely on advice from support systems. Two types of adaptive team support have been developed and evaluated that are intended to support human-computer teams in estimating trust appropriately and making appropriate reliance decisions thereof. The first adaptive system (graphical support) supports by communicating the estimated degree of over- or under-trust. The second system (adaptive autonomy) takes over a reliance decision when this estimation exceeds a certain threshold. The two types of support were implemented in a multi-agent environment where human operators and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) work together on a target classification task. We evaluated the two support types in terms of team performance, satisfaction and effectiveness and obtained promising results.",,第2页.xls

796,Optimal consensus algorithms for cooperative team of agents subject to partial information,2008,"The objectives of this work are the development and design of controllers for a team of agents that accomplish consensus for agents' output in both leaderless (ILL) and modified leader-follower (MLF) architectures. Towards this end, a semi-decentralized optimal control strategy is designed based on minimization of individual cost functions over a finite horizon using local information. Interactions among agents due to information flows are represented through the control channels in characterization of the dynamical model of each agent. It is shown that minimization of the proposed cost functions results in a modified consensus algorithm for LL and MLF architectures. In the latter case, the desired output is assumed to be available for only the leader while the followers should follow the leader using information exchanges existing among themselves and the leader through a predefined topology. Furthermore, the performance of the cooperative team under a member's fault is formally analyzed and investigated. The robustness of the team to uncertainties and faults in the leader or followers and adaptability of the team members to these unanticipated situations are also shown rigorously. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies in achieving prespecified requirements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第2页.xls

800,Distributed constraint optimization for teams of mobile sensing agents,2015,"Coordinating a mobile sensor team (MST) to cover targets is a challenging problem in many multiagent applications. Such applications are inherently dynamic due to changes in the environment, technology failures, and incomplete knowledge of the agents. Agents must adaptively respond by changing their locations to continually optimize the coverage of targets. We propose distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOP)_MST, a new model for representing MST problems that is based on DCOP. In DCOP_MST, agents maintain variables for their physical positions, while each target is represented by a constraint that reflects the quality of coverage of that target. In contrast to conventional, static DCOPs, DCOP_MST not only permits dynamism but exploits it by restricting variable domains to nearby locations; consequently, variable domains and constraints change as the agents move through the environment. DCOP_MST confers three major advantages. It directly represents the multiple forms of dynamism inherent in MSTs. It also provides a compact representation that can be solved efficiently with local search algorithms, with information and communication locality based on physical locality as typically occurs in MST applications. Finally, DCOP_MST facilitates organization of the team into multiple sub-teams that can specialize in different roles and coordinate their activity through dynamic events. We demonstrate how a search-and-detection team responsible for finding new targets and a surveillance sub-team tasked with coverage of known targets can effectively work together to improve performance while using the DCOP_MST framework to coordinate. We propose different algorithms to meet the specific needs of each sub-team and several methods for cooperation between sub-teams. For the search-and-detection team, we develop an algorithm based on the DSA that forces intensive exploration for new targets. For the surveillance sub-team, we adapt several incomplete DCOP algorithms, including MGM, DSA, DBA, and Max-sum, which requires us to develop an efficient method for agents to find the value assignment in their local environment that is optimal in minimizing the maximum unmet coverage requirement over all targets. The disadvantage of dynamic domains based on physical locality is that adaptations of standard local search algorithms tend to become trapped in local optima where targets beyond the immediate range of the agents go uncovered. To address this shortcoming we develop exploration methods to be used with the local search algorithms. Our algorithms are extensively evaluated in a simulation environment. We use a reputation model to determine the individual credibility of agents and consider both additive and submodular joint credibility functions for determining coverage of targets by multiple agents. The performance is measured on two objectives: minimizing the maximum remaining coverage requirement, and minimizing the sum of remaining coverage requirements. Our results show that DSA and MGM with the exploration heuristics outperform the other incomplete algorithms across a wide range of settings. Furthermore, organizing the team into two sub-teams leads to significant gains in performance, and performance continues to improve with greater cooperation between the sub-teams.",,第2页.xls

However, many other non-object-based implementation techniques may be just as useful. Also, for agents with mentalistic attitudes, the high-level specification of agent behavior requires numerous concepts outside the object paradigm; e.g. plans, communication, intentions, roles, and teams.",,第2页.xls

804,Learning from My Partner's Actions: Roles in Decentralized Robot Teams [arXiv],2019,"When teams of robots collaborate to complete a task, communication is often necessary. Like humans, robot teammates should implicitly communicate through their actions: but interpreting our partner's actions is typically difficult, since a given action may have many different underlying reasons. Here we propose an alternate approach: instead of not being able to infer whether an action is due to exploration, exploitation, or communication, we define separate roles for each agent. Because each role defines a distinct reason for acting (e.g., only exploit, only communicate), teammates now correctly interpret the meaning behind their partner's actions. Our results suggest that leveraging and alternating roles leads to performance comparable to teams that explicitly exchange messages.

807,Herramienta de Simulacion Basada en Agentes para la Ayuda en la Formacion y Configuracion de Equipos de Trabajo (Modelling human bahaviour at work: an agent-based simulation to support the configuration of work teams,2011,"The modelling and implementation of human behaviour into artificial systems have attracted the interest of several people from different disciplines given the natural complexity and multidisciplinary of this phenomenon. This type of models offers a great potential in a large set of domains including military applications, training and learning, e-health, and the representation of crisis and emergency situations among others. A particular interesting application is the modelling of human behaviour within groups. More specifically, the model of human behaviour in a work team would be used to analyse the specific dynamics behind individual and work team performance. The analysis of these dynamics then can be used as additional and useful information that supports the decision-making in the formation and configuration of real work teams in companies. The work described in this thesis presents a novel agent-based simulation model that aims to support this decision-making process. This global objective is achieved through the modelling of the team candidates as software agents forming a virtual team. The configured virtual team then can be used to experiment with the internal and contextual factors that produce and direct the individual and work team performance. The real team candidates are modelled through a set of selected human characteristics that have been proved to influence human behaviour when making work activities in a work team. These characteristics include cognitive capabilities, emotional state, personality styles and social-related skills. Using the values in these attributes in combination with values represented in the attributes of project's tasks, the model produces statistical information that represents the possible performance of the team members over the assigned project. The theoretical background of the model is presented through a deep review of existing (mainly psychological, sociological and organisational) theories focused in the study of human behaviour within the particular context of teams. The work presented in this thesis uses the findings from this theoretical research to implement the main characteristics of the proposed agent-based model and to further develop a usable software simulation tool. This tool has been used to validate the proposed model through the comparison of the work team's performance results generated by the simulation tool against the performance evaluation results of a real work team from a large company. The validation results and the identified open issues to improve the model are also presented in the final part of this thesis document.",,第2页.xls

810,Feedback Design Considerations for Intelligent Team Tutoring Systems,2018,"Challenges arise when developing a computer-based Intelligent Team Tutoring System (ITTS) that attempts to deliver feedback to teams as effectively as a human tutor. The purpose of this current work is to outline elements of feedback that should be considered when designing feedback for an ITTS. The authors present the results of a study that consisted of 32 participants grouped into 16 teams of two. Each team conducted a surveillance task where they received individual or team feedback. Feedback content was written using either the bald (direct feedback; no need for interpretation) or off-record (general feedback; interpretation needed) etiquette strategy. The results showed that feedback delivered using the bald etiquette strategy positively correlated with improved performance. The results also showed that team level feedback positively correlated with more accurate self-assessment among participants. This suggests that in an ITTS, direct feedback can lead to better performance, and that feedback provided at the team level can help to align self-interpretation of performance with actual task performance.",,第2页.xls

Further, flexibility in amount and type of transparency information provided to human collaborators may allow for the accommodation of known biases (e.g., misuse and disuse). To understand the utility of transparency manipulation, it is important to consider the context of the manipulation. This report considers two contextual factors that might influence the impact of transparency: hysteresis and face threat. We describe the nature of the influence of these factors, and provide a short demonstration of their influence. Outcomes show that order of transparency and face threat affect the impact of transparency information on performance, reliance, and trust. This demonstration makes the case that an adaptive transparency paradigm should consider other aspects of human-agent interaction for successful application.",,第2页.xls
813,Context-Driven Proactive Decision Support for Hybrid Teams,2019,"A synergy between AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) will significantly improve sense-making, situational awareness, proactivity, and collaboration. However, the key challenge is to identify the underlying context within which humans interact with smart machines. Knowledge of the context facilitates proactive allocation among members of a human-smart machine (agent) collective that balances autonomy with human interaction, without displacing humans from their supervisory role of ensuring that the system goals are achievable. In this article, we address four research questions as a means of advancing toward proactive autonomy: how to represent the interdependencies among the key elements of a hybrid team; how to rapidly identify and characterize critical contextual elements that require adaptation over time; how to allocate system tasks among machines and agents for superior performance; and how to enhance the performance of machine counterparts to provide intelligent and proactive courses of action while considering the cognitive states of human operators. The answers to these four questions help us to illustrate the integration of AI and IoT applied to the maritime domain, where we define context as an evolving multidimensional feature space for heterogeneous search, routing, and resource allocation in uncertain environments via proactive decision support systems.",,第2页.xls

816,Internet collaboration and service composition as a loose form of teamwork,2007,"This paper describes Web service composition as a form of teamwork, where the Web services are team members in a loose collaboration. We argue that newer hierarchical teamwork models are more appropriate for Web service composition than the traditional models involving joint beliefs and joint intentions. We describe our system for developing and executing Web service compositions as team plans in JACK Teams,((TM) 1) and discuss the relationships between this approach and service orchestration languages such as Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS). We discuss briefly how the use of Al planning can also be incorporated into this model, and identify some of the research issues involved. Incorporating Web service compositions into a mature Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agent team framework allows for integration of Web services seamlessly into a powerful application execution paradigm that supports sophisticated reasoning.

817,The Goal Oriented Teams (GORITE) framework,2008,"Goal Oriented Teams (GORITE) is a Java framework for implementation of Goal Oriented Process Models in a Team Oriented Paradigm. The GORITE concept combines a Team Oriented view of software systems with Coal Oriented process modelling, and offers an effective approach to complex and large-scale software. A Java developer would use GORITE for implementing their Team Oriented design, and whilst the framework makes this a straight-forward task, it relies on the Java developer utilising background skills in Team and Goal Oriented Programming to form the design. The Coal Oriented Programming side of GORITE provides a BDI (Belief - Desire - Intention) style execution machinery for goal oriented process models. Technically the goal hierarchies, which define how goals are achieved by means of achieving sub goals, are data structures that are interpreted in order to carry out the process steps that achieving the goals require. The Team Oriented Programming paradigm takes systems design to a new level. As design concept it extends the Agent Oriented Programming paradigm by including explicit modelling of the organisation of agents that comprise an application, whilst allowing for openness in actual composition. This paper is a presentation of the GORITE framework, with a primary focus on illustrating how the GORITE elements are used for capturing Goal Oriented Teams designs, and with less focus on the methodological philosophy underpinning this style of programming.",,第2页.xls

819,An Adjustable-Autonomy Agent for Intelligent Environments,2010,"Autonomy of embedded agents in intelligent environments is highly debated topic; while some believe that agents should have very minimal autonomy and should only act as directly instructed by the user, others consider providing agents with autonomy to be an essential aspect to building intelligent environments. This paper reports on the current progress of our project to enable human users and agents to collaborate in managing intelligent environments as a team. We seek to develop an adjustable-autonomy agent in an effort to explore user acceptance of pervasive computing and the use of autonomous agents therein, as wells as aiming to improve the robustness and reliability of future intelligent environment systems. We present our Adjustable-autonomy Behaviour-Based Agent (ABBA) architecture model and discuss our initial trials with our prototype system, built on a smart home emulator, which demonstrate the plausibility of employing adjustable-autonomy in full-scale intelligent environments and pervasive computing systems.",,第2页.xls

CE has been well documented as a philosophy for improving productivity through a systematic approach to design. There are many active CE conferences, and there is even a graduate school in the subject now. CE environments provide a rich variety of collaboration tools and technologies to promote interaction among interdisciplinary teams and to ensure that relevant information is available to team members in a timely manner. The ultimate, future vision of CE is to facilitate the formation and interaction of teams of multidisciplinary engineers and designers that will collaborate in the development and maintenance of products throughout the product life cycle. These teams may be geographically distributed across companies and continents, and may dynamically evolve over time to best meet the requirements of the customer.",,第2页.xls
822,A distributed architecture for norm-aware agent societies,2006,We propose a distributed architecture to endow multi-agent systems with a social layer in which normative positions are explicitly represented and managed via rules. Our rules operate on a representation of the states of affairs of a multi-agent system. We define the syntax and semantics of our rules and an interpreter; we achieve greater precision and expressiveness by allowing constraints to be part of our rules. We show how the rules and states come together in a distributed architecture in which a team of administrative agents employ a tuple space to guide the execution of a multi-agent system.,,第2页.xls

The framework is based on a review of the literature and on the systematic analysis of the first-generation social agents available on the Web. Moreover, it is enriched by empirical results of two user-based evaluations of Granny, a social agent that tries to inject a specific personality into the interaction between a financial service provider and a customer. The assumption behind our research is that social agents require a reexamination of the traditional HCI approach to system design and evaluation.

Researchers are working to define efficient teamwork architecture but a limited progress has been made towards efficient task execution mechanisms by group of agents in collaboration and coordination with each other. We have developed a teamwork architecture to enhance the performance and task execution efficiency of software agents. This architecture has been inferred from Honey Bee teamwork strategies and a short comparison has been made between the similarities of Honey Bee and Agents teamwork. We have also classified and analyzed two different teamwork approaches depending upon the type of collaboration among agents using case study approach.,,第2页.xls
825,Scheduling the supply chain by teams of agents,2003,"When a supply chain is established supply chain management (SCM) needs supporting tools for the tasks of operative planning, scheduling, and coordination. These tasks have to be performed not only on the level of the enterprises involved but also within their established business entities (e.g. plants, areas, resource groups, resources) in which the high level schedules have to be put into operation. Most approaches of SCM favor a hierarchical coordination of the supply chain together with powerful algorithmic solutions for the mainly predictive scheduling tasks. These approaches are lacking the incorporation of feedback from lower levels and possibilities of reactive scheduling. Thus flexibility and reactivity are main issues to be improved. We present an approach using teams of cooperating agents in a hierarchical as well as heterarchical way to overcome the problems mentioned. To simplify the generation of such a hierarchy of agents, we develop a framework for scheduling agents that contains the basic features of an agent e.g., event handling, data storage, communication, and possibilities for appending scheduling algorithms and specific cooperation mechanisms. The framework is described and an example illustrates how it is used to build teams of cooperating agents on several levels of the scheduling hierarchy.",,第2页.xls

Panelists were selected to represent diverse interests and backgrounds (i.e., defense, industry, and academia).Chris Brillprovided opening remarks to frame the discussion and introduce the panelists. He then raised several questions related to HMT, such as what is HMT, what level of autonomy is required for HMT, and how do we develop trust in autonomous teammates that learn, change, and potentially, individuate.Missy Cummingsbuilt on the issue of learning systems, addressing challenges of certifying systems that, as a function of learning, may cease to be known quantities.Bill Evansspoke to the need for transparency in human-agent teaming.Joseph Lyonsaddressed social factors in HMT.Peter Hancockdetailed his concerns about whether forays into HMT are even advisable, particularly as doing so may lead to dehumanization, or worse, volitional demotion of humans from our current status as apex lifeforms on Earth.

GOALdigger-AIG-Hagen was programmed in the GOAL agent programming language. The aim of this paper was to improve on AI techniques for multi-agent systems, like machine learning in task selection and ant colony optimization algorithms in the optimisation of map exploration. Further, the use of agents to sabotage the rival team was researched. On the technical side, debugging and logging the states of agents with a custom mini-percept was explored. Saboteurs have been found to be very advantageous by reducing the score of the opposing team of agents. A repelling ant colony optimization algorithm has shown to reduce the time needed to explore the map, compared to a semi-random algorithm. Tournament data on task selection with machine learning could not be obtained due to a programming bug. The custom mini-percept was found to make debugging and learning about the state of agents faster and simpler than unordered log files.",,第2页.xls
828,Adaptive and cooperative mobile robots,2007,This paper focuses on the development of intelligent multiagent robot teams capable of acting autonomously and of collaborating in a dynamic environment to reach team objectives. The paper proposes a new adaptive action selection architecture that enables a team of robot agents to achieve adaptive cooperative control and modify their performance during the specified time of the mission. These abilities are important because of uncertainty in the environmental conditions and because of possible functional failures in some team members. The improvement in team performance is achieved by updating the control parameters of the robots based on knowledge acquired on-line. Experiments have been conducted on teams of mobile robots performing a cooperative box-pushing task. The results show that the robot teams were able to achieve adaptive cooperative control despite dynamic changes in the environment and variations in the capabilities of the team members.,,第2页.xls
829,Comparing Human Trust Attitudes Towards Human and Agent Teammates,2020,"Agents' roles in our lives increasingly matter as they engage with people in a variety of important tasks. To achieve successful human-agent teamwork, it is critical to know the differences and similarities in people's attitudes towards human and agent teammates in virtual environments. It is unclear to what extent we can rely on the rich literature on interpersonal trust, i.e., trust between humans, while designing trustworthy agent teammates for human-agent teamwork and constructing hypotheses for human-agent trust research. This study empirically investigates the differences in the growth of human trust in and reliance on human and agent teammates during initial interactions. We developed a team coordination game, the Game of Trust, in which two players repeatedly cooperate to complete team tasks without prior assignment of subtasks. The effects of teammate type, i.e., human vs. agent, are evaluated by performing an extensive set of controlled experiments with participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We collect both teamwork performance data as well as surveys to gauge participants' trust in their teammates. The empirical results show that humans' trust attitudes towards human and agent teammates differ: trust in and reliance on teammate and team performance were slightly higher when playing with the agent teammate. Moreover, the level of trustworthiness of a teammate is more influential on human trust compared to teammate type. These findings enhance our understanding of changes in human trust concerning teammate type towards achieving successful virtual teamwork.",,第2页.xls

831,Geometric task decomposition in a multi-agent environment,2006,"Task decomposition in a multi-agent environment is often performed online. This paper proposes a method for sub-task allocation that can be performed before the agents are deployed, reducing the need for communication among agents during their mission. The proposed method uses a Voronoi diagram to partition the task-space among team members and includes two phases: static and dynamic. Static decomposition ( performed in simulation before the start of the mission) repeatedly partitions the task-space by generating random diagrams and measuring the efficacy of the corresponding sub-task allocation. If necessary, dynamic decomposition ( performed in simulation after the start of a mission) modifies the result of a static decomposition (i.e., in case of resource limitations for some agents). Empirical results are reported for the problem of surveillance of an arbitrary region by a team of agents.",,第2页.xls
832,Cooperative mobile agents search using beehive partitioned structure and Tabu Random search algorithm,2013,"In search and surveillance operations, deploying a team of mobile agents provides a robust solution that has multiple advantages over using a single agent in efficiency and minimizing exploration time. This paper addresses the challenge of identifying a target in a given environment when using a team of mobile agents by proposing a novel method of mapping and movement of agent teams in a cooperative manner. The approach consists of two parts. First, the region is partitioned into a hexagonal beehive structure in order to provide equidistant movements in every direction and to allow for more natural and flexible environment mapping. Additionally, in search environments that are partitioned into hexagons, mobile agents have an efficient travel path while performing searches due to this partitioning approach. Second, we use a team of mobile agents that move in a cooperative manner and utilize the Tabu Random algorithm to search for the target.Due to the ever-increasing use of robotics and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms, the field of cooperative multi-agent search has developed many applications recently that would benefit from the use of the approach presented in this work, including: search and rescue operations, surveillance, data collection, and border patrol. In this paper, the increased efficiency of the Tabu Random Search algorithm method in combination with hexagonal partitioning is simulated, analyzed, and advantages of this approach are presented and discussed.",,第2页.xls
833,A Mobile Agent Team Works Model for HPC big Data Analysis: Fuzzy Logic Application,2015,The aim of this paper is to present a distributed implementation of the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2FL) algorithm in a mobile agent based distributed computing platform. The proposed algorithm is assigned to be implemented on an SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) architecture which is based on a cooperative mobile agent model. It is constituted by a set of mobile agents as AVPEs (Agent Virtual Processing Elements) in order to improve the processing resources needed for performing the big data image segmentation. In this work we focused on the application of this algorithm to process the big data MRI (Magnetic Resonance Images) image. The input image is splitted into elementary images by the Mobile Team leader Agent and encapsulated one per AVPE. Each AVPE perform and exchange the segmentation results and maintain asynchronous communication with their Team leader agent until the convergence of this algorithm. The obtained experimental results in terms of accuracy and efficiency analysis of the proposed distributed implementation are achieved thanks to the mobile agents several interesting skills introduced in this distributed computational model.,,第2页.xls

However, a problem that occurs frequently in the implementation of PBL is the presence of passive students who are usually students who have difficulty working in teams or who are unmotivated during the process of teaching and learning. An aspect that can positively influence the implementation process of the PBL is the recommendation of context-sensitive Learning Objects (LOs). Thus, this paper presents an approach based on an animated pedagogical agent and three other agents for the detection of passive students and for recommendation of LOs in accordance to student context in order to improve the learning process of PBL.",,第2页.xls

During a controlled study, human subjects participated in a minimal risk research (i.e., both as victims or caregivers) in which firefighter EMTs participated in a simulated training exercise that mimicked their real-world operations. During the study, there were two testing days. Day one included (10) victims and (20) caregivers who participated in a full day of training and familiarized themselves with wearable AR Head Mounted Display (HMD) and a Juxtopia (R) Virtual Tutor (JVT) software application.

836,An agent architecture to design self-organizing collectives: Principles and application,2003,"Designing teams which have a task to execute in a very dynamic environment is a complex problem. Determining the relevant organization of these teams by using group or role notions might be very difficult and even impossible for human analysts. Although an organization can be found or approximated, it becomes complicated to design entities, or agents in our case, that take into account, at the conception and design phases, all possible situations an agent could face up to. Emergent and self-organizing approaches to model adaptive multi-agent systems avoid these difficulties. In this paper, we propose a new approach, to design Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems with emergent functionality, which enables us to focus on the design of agents that compose the system. In fact, self-organization of the system is led by the environmental feedback that each agent perceives. Interactions and organization evolve, providing an adequate function to the system, which fits to its environment as well. Such functions have enough properties to be considered as emergent phenomena. First, we briefly present the Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems theory (AMAS) and our view of self-organization. In the second part, a multi-level architecture is proposed to model agents and to consider groups of agents as self-organizing teams. In the third part, we describe a sample robot group behaviour, the setting up of traffic in a constrained environment. Our architecture allows the emergence of a coherent collective behaviour: the dedication of corridors to specific directions. Finally, we show what is emergent by the analysis of results arising from measurements of collective phenomena.",,第2页.xls
837,A neurosymbolic cognitive architecture framework for handling novelties in open worlds ☆,2024,"Open world environments are those in which novel objects, agents, events, and more can appear and contradict previous understandings of the environment. This runs counter to the closed world assumption used in most AI research, where the environment is assumed to be fully understood and unchanging. The types of environments AI agents can be deployed in are limited by the inability to handle the novelties that occur in open world environments. This paper presents a novel cognitive architecture framework to handle open -world novelties. This framework combines symbolic planning, counterfactual reasoning, reinforcement learning, and deep computer vision to detect and accommodate novelties. We introduce general algorithms for exploring open worlds using inference and machine learning methodologies to facilitate novelty accommodation. The ability to detect and accommodate novelties allows agents built on this framework to successfully complete tasks despite a variety of novel changes to the world. Both the framework components and the entire system are evaluated in Minecraft-like simulated environments. Our results indicate that agents are able to efficiently complete tasks while accommodating concealed novelties not shared with the architecture development team.",,第2页.xls
838,Intelligent Tutoring Games with Agent Modeling,2009,"Business strategy educators increasingly rely on simulation games to provide Students with experience in strategic decision making. Business games however often limit interaction to operational decision making so discovering the value of alternative strategies in different situations may take a lot of time. Furthermore, to ensure students can grasp the system complexity at this operational level, game scenarios remain relatively simple. We hypothesize that business game effectiveness for strategy education can increase if players instead create teams of delegate agents to appropriately handle operations in more complex settings. To test this we are working on an intelligent learning environment that will help players create successful teams of agents to handle operations.",,第2页.xls
839,Achieving flexible task delegation in role-based agent teams,2008,"Teamwork has become increasingly important to many disciplines. In our opinion, an effective design of a teamwork language should be able to handle unexpected uncertainties and allow for the conceptual specification of teamwork knowledge for reuse. This paper introduces RoB-MALLET, a teamwork language based on the concepts of role and role variable. An important characteristic of our notion of role is that it includes the specific operations that an agent filling the role must perform in a specific setting as well as their ordering constraints. Taking this view on the definition of role has enabled us to present the responsibility of roles, to reason about the assignment of real agents to roles, and to achieve a certain level of plan reusability. Finally, we present several experiments that explore plan reusability of RoB-MALLET, show that it is flexible in supporting simultaneity of invocation and evaluate its efficiency in supporting teamwork.",,第2页.xls
840,Collective intentions,2002,"In this paper the notion of collective intention in teams of agents involved in cooperative problem solving (CPS) in multiagent systems (MAS) is investigated. Starting from individual intentions, goals, and beliefs defining agents' local asocial motivational and informational attitudes, we arrive at an understanding of collective intention in cooperative teams. The presented definitions are rather strong; in particular a collective intention implies that all members intend for all others to share that intention.-Thus a team is created on the basis of collective intention, and exists as long as this attitude between team members exists, after which the group may disintegrate. For this reason it is crucial that collective intention lasts long enough.Collective intentions are formalized in a multi-modal logical framework. Completeness of this logic with respect to an appropriate class of Kripke models is proved. Two versions of collective intentions are discussed in the context of different situations. It is assumed that these definitions reflect solely vital aspects of motivational attitudes, leaving room for case-specific extensions. This makes the framework flexible and not overloaded. Together with individual and collective knowledge and belief, collective intention constitutes a basis for preparing a plan, reflected in the strongest attitude, i.e., in collective commitment, defined and investigated in our other papers.",,第2页.xls

842,On Evaluating and Comparing Conversational Agents [arXiv],2018,"Conversational agents are exploding in popularity. However, much work remains in the area of non goal-oriented conversations, despite significant growth in research interest over recent years. To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million dollar university competition where sixteen selected university teams built conversational agents to deliver the best social conversational experience. Alexa Prize provided the academic community with the unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by millions of users. The subjectivity associated with evaluating conversations is key element underlying the challenge of building non-goal oriented dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive evaluation strategy with multiple metrics designed to reduce subjectivity by selecting metrics which correlate well with human judgement. The proposed metrics provide granular analysis of the conversational agents, which is not captured in human ratings. We show that these metrics can be used as a reasonable proxy for human judgment. We provide a mechanism to unify the metrics for selecting the top performing agents, which has also been applied throughout the Alexa Prize competition. To our knowledge, to date it is the largest setting for evaluating agents with millions of conversations and hundreds of thousands of ratings from users. We believe that this work is a step towards an automatic evaluation process for conversational AIs.",,第2页.xls
843,The synthetic teammate project,2010,"The main objective of the Synthetic Teammate project is to develop language and task enabled synthetic agents capable of being integrated into team training simulations. To achieve this goal, the agents must be able to closely match human behavior. The initial application for the synthetic teammate research is creation of an agent able to perform the functions of a pilot for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) simulation as part of a three-person team. The agent, or synthetic teammate, is being developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The major components include: language comprehension and generation, dialog management, agent-environment interaction, and situation assessment. Initial empirical results suggest that the agent-environment interaction is a good approximation to human behavior in the UAV environment, and we are planning further empirical tests of the synthetic teammate operating with human teammates. This paper covers the project's modeling approach, challenges faced, progress made toward an integrated synthetic teammate, and lessons learned during development.",,第2页.xls

845,Multiagent learning using a variable learning rate,2002,"Learning to act in a multiagent environment is a difficult problem since the normal definition of an optimal policy no longer applies. The optimal policy at any moment depends on the policies of the other agents. This creates a situation of learning a moving target. Previous learning algorithms have one of two shortcomings depending on their approach. They either converge to a policy that may not be optimal against the specific opponents' policies, or they may not converge at all. In this article we examine this learning problem in the framework of stochastic games. We look at a number of previous learning algorithms showing how they fail at one of the above criteria. We then contribute a new reinforcement learning technique using a variable learning rate to overcome these shortcomings. Specifically, we introduce the WoLF principle, Win or Learn Fast, for varying the learning rate. We examine this technique theoretically, proving convergence in self-play on a restricted class of iterated matrix games. We also present empirical results on a variety of more general stochastic games, in situations of self-play and otherwise, demonstrating the wide applicability of this method.

846,Multi-robot intelligence: flexible strategy for robotic teams,2012,"Summary form only given. RoboCup is a worldwide initiative, that aims at fostering artificial intelligence and robotics research. This domain is organized around several Leagues, with different characteristics, and distinct robotic teams but where multi-agent coordination and strategic planning are two of the major research topics. However, innovations in these areas are often developed and applied to only one domain and a single RoboCup league, without proper generalization. This talk presents high-level coordination methodologies that may be applied to create flexible multi-robot teams capable of performing complex tasks in dynamic environments. The methodologies described include flexible formations (situation based strategic positioning), dynamic role and positioning exchange, flexible setplays (freely-definable, flexible and multi-step plans) and the concept of strategy (combining tactics, situations, formations, roles and setplays). The application of these methodologies to different RoboCup leagues (such as the simulation 2d, simulation 3d, rescue, middle size and standard platform league) is also described along with the very good results achieved in RoboCup competitions by our teams.",,第2页.xls

The meaning and the differences of co-operation and of co-ordinated play in real soccer and in artificial soccer will be discussed.

848,"Garbage In, Garbage Out: Mitigating Human Biases in Data Entry by Means of Artificial Intelligence",2023,"Current HCI research often focuses on mitigating algorithmic biases. While such algorithmic fairness during model training is worthwhile, we see fit to mitigate human cognitive biases earlier, namely during data entry. We developed a conversational agent with voice-based data entry and visualization to support financial consultations, which are human-human settings with information asymmetries. In a pre-study, we reveal data-entry biases in advisors by a quantitative analysis of 5 advisors consulting 15 clients in total. Our main study evaluates the conversational agent with 12 advisors and 24 clients. A thematic analysis of interviews shows that advisors introduce biases by feeling and forgetting data. Additionally, the conversational agent makes financial consultations more transparent and automates data entry. These findings may be transferred to various dyads, such as doctor visits. Finally, we stress that AI not only poses a risk of becoming a mirror of human biases but also has the potential to intervene in the early stages of data entry.",,第2页.xls

This testbed allows researchers to carry out human-robot interaction studies and gain better understanding of, for example, how a robot's communication can improve human-robot team performance by fostering better trust relationships among humans and their robot teammates.

851,Evolutionary Multi-Agent Systems: An Adaptive and Dynamic Approach to Optimization,2009,"This paper explores the ability of a virtual team of specialized strategic software agents to cooperate and evolve to adaptively search an optimization design space. Our goal is to demonstrate and understand how such dynamically evolving teams may search more effectively than any single agent or a priori set strategy. We present a core framework and methodology that has potential applications in layout, scheduling, manufacturing, and other engineering design areas. The communal agent team organizational structure employed allows cooperation of agents through the products of their work and creates an ever changing set of individual solutions for the agents to work on. In addition, the organizational structure allows the framework to be adaptive to changes in the design space that may occur during the optimization process. An evolutionary approach is used, but evolution occurs at the strategic rather than the solution level, where the strategies of agents in the team are the decisions for when and how to choose and alter a solution, and the agents evolve over time. As an application of this approach in a static domain, individual solutions are tours in the familiar combinatorial optimization problem of the traveling salesman. With a constantly changing set of these tours, the team, with each agent employing a different solution strategy, must evolve to apply the solution strategies, which are most useful given the solution set at any point in the process. We discuss the extensions to our preliminary work that will make our framework useful to the design and optimization community. [DOI: 10.1115/1.3013847]",,第2页.xls

853,The equilibrium of agent mind: The balance between agent theories and practice,2006,"This paper outlines the abridged history of agent reasoning theories as 'agent mind' from the perspective of its implementation inspired by new trends such as 'teaming' and 'learning'. This paper covers how the need for such new notions in agent technology introduced a change in fundamental agent theories and how it can be balanced by inducing some original cognitive notions from the field of 'artificial mind'. This paper concentrates on the popular agent reasoning notion of Belief Desire Intention (BDI) and outlines the importance of the human-centric agent reasoning model as a step towards the next generation of agents to bridge the gap between human and agent. The current trend including the human-centric nature of agent mind and human-agent teaming is explained, and its needs and characteristics are also explained. This paper reports add-on implementation on BDI in order to facilitate human-centric nature of agent mind. This human-centric nature and concepts such as teaming agreements are utilised to aid human-agent teaming in a simulated environment. The issues in order to make agents more human-like or receptive are outlined.",,第2页.xls
854,A testbed for studying coordination of autonomous agents,1999,"We are interested in developing intelligent agent applications where agents are autonomous and are able to adapt to changing requirements and/or environmental demands. In particular, we are interested in multiagent systems, or agent groups which must cooperatively decide on job assignments that will maximize the productivity of the group. To evaluate our proposed group adaptation mechanisms, we have chosen a simulated robotic soccer domain for experimentation. We have developed a soccer simulator in Java, which allows us to evaluate agent behavioral strategies for effectively collaborating with other team members while countering threats posed by the opposing team. We will describe both the work completed and the system components under construction.",,第2页.xls
855,Meta-agency and individual power,2009,"The state of the art in the agent field is at the frontier of deploying real intelligent agents, able to build their own understanding of the world and of associated processes. Maybe that goal can be achieved through individual power, a framing concept for the agent's inner capabilities to achieve dominant goals. The research on individual power started from the BDI model and led to the distinction between external and internal factors in the agent's behaviour: while the former depends on the relation the agent has with its environment (including peers) and ties in with social power, the latter links up to the agent control and is rather less understood. In the individual power study, the focus is set on the integration of the agent's will, commitment and control structure. Such integration can be interpreted as an extension of the classic belief-desire-intention trilogy. This paper describes an experiment about the integration of will and commitment management in the agent's control structure. The experiment consists of two teams of agents, competing for resource gathering. While one team features reactive control, the other team uses new ideas exploring meta-agency for agent control and will for behaviour design. This experiment illustrates the integration and a virtual application of previous work on these subjects. The meta-agent and mental states based control is proven able to define flexible and effective behaviours. The agent's will, by centralising the management of commitments, simplifies the implementation, debugging and interpretation of such behaviours.",,第2页.xls
856,Toward inquiry-based education through interacting software agents,1996,"The University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL) project is creating an infrastructure for rendering library services over a digital network. When fully developed, the UMDL will provide a wealth of information sources and library services to students, researchers, and educators. Tasks are distributed among numerous specialized modules called agents. The three classes of agents are user interface agents, mediator agents, and collection interface agents. Complex tasks are accomplished by teams of specialized agents working togetherfor example, by interleaving various types of search. The UMDL is being deployed in three arenas: secondary-school science classrooms, the University of Michigan library, and space-science laboratories. The development team expects the scale and diversity of the project to test their technical ideas about distributed agents, interoperability, mediation, and economical resource allocation.",,第2页.xls

858,Transparency for a Workload-Adaptive Cognitive Agent in a Manned-Unmanned Teaming Application,2020,"This study focuses on the transparent design of a cognitive agent to enhance situation awareness in two aspects of a human-agent teaming application: assisted system management and mixed-initiative mission planning. Adaptive and complex agent behavior might result in the failure to comprehend resulting interventions, a decrease in trust, and a loss of overall situation awareness. This study describes and validates a concept for transparent agent design by adopting the transparency strategies proposed by the situation awareness-based agent transparency model. The overall objective was to improve the human operator's perception, comprehension, and projection of the agent's support. The concept was applied to the prototype of a workload-adaptive cognitive agent, which supports a helicopter crew during mission planning and execution in complex and dynamically changing multi-vehicle missions. A human-in-the-loop experiment revealed enhancements in situation awareness and performance. Subjective trust measures implied an increase in human-like characteristics of the cognitive agent. The results and the potential for further research are discussed.",,第2页.xls
859,A cartoon animated science learning tool for lower secondary students of Mauritius,2017,"Technology is a phenomenon which is currently dominating the society in which we are living and it has many features which can be exploited in the field of education. Presently in Mauritius, adolescent learners have received little attention when it comes to their approach of learning. At this point in life, they are experiencing a lot of changes in their lives and often they lose interest in their studies. In this work, we have implemented a tool which has been crafted according to the needs of adolescents. The tool makes learning effective and meaningful while at the same time encourage self-learning. Considerations have been shown towards the learning process, the proper use of HCI relative to the characteristic and nature of adolescents, their different learning styles, motivational factors and methods of evaluating performance. The system has been designed to teach adolescents a topic in Biology namely the digestive system with the assistance of cartoons. Among its features is a forum to encourage group learning, a virtual agent to accompany them in their learning, feedback from teachers and a cartoon animated lesson for better understanding.",,第2页.xls
860,On situated reasoning in multi-agent systems,1999,"We analyse the relationships between different approaches to formalising interactivity in dynamic systems. We first formally define various types of situated agent architectures and encapsulate them in a hierarchical framework. We then analyse and identify domain classes and action theories corresponding to given agent architecture types. This approach can specifically assist in mapping logic theories of actions to reactive agent architectures, where ramifications are embedded in situated behaviours.

861,Learning of classifier agents based on incremental genetic algorithms,2002,Incremental learning has been widely addressed in machine teaming literature to cope with learning tasks where the learning environment is ever changing or training samples become available over time. This paper employs a genetic algorithm (GA) as a basic learning algorithm and proposes incremental genetic algorithms (IGA) for incremental learning within one or more classifier agents in a multi-agent environment. We evaluate IGA with two benchmark classification databases. The simulation results show that IGA can be successfully used for incremental learning and speeds up the learning process compared to the traditional GA.,,第2页.xls
862,Coordinated exploration in concurrent reinforcement learning [arXiv],2018,"We consider a team of reinforcement learning agents that concurrently learn to operate in a common environment. We identify three properties - adaptivity, commitment, and diversity - which are necessary for efficient coordinated exploration and demonstrate that straightforward extensions to single-agent optimistic and posterior sampling approaches fail to satisfy them. As an alternative, we propose seed sampling, which extends posterior sampling in a manner that meets these requirements. Simulation results investigate how per-agent regret decreases as the number of agents grows, establishing substantial advantages of seed sampling over alternative exploration schemes.",,第2页.xls

865,Formal specification of humanitarian disaster management processes,2012,"Disaster situations are dynamic and demanding a change in response, and information is received in a fragmented manner during the early stages of the event. Therefore, a Rapid Assessment and Intervention Team (RAIT Team) is established to respond quickly to the event, by achieving an initial assessment helping to understand the nature and scope of the incident and to determine the required assistance. The RAIT Team can be considered as a Reactive Collaborative Network, having to coordinate numerous actors and two or more reactive parallel sub-processes. Therefore, formal specification and validation methods and tools are needed while specifying and verifying RAIT processes to detect and correct deficiencies and faults In this perspective, the present paper proposes to use the Decisional Reactive Agents (DRA) based approach for the formal modeling and checking of RAIT system processes, so that they can be directly implemented in software environments with the maximum of logical correctness. The proposed approach is illustrated by formally checking temporal constraints of a transversal RAIT process acting in case of medical or humanitarian emergency.",,第2页.xls
866,Creating Autonomous Adaptive Agents in a Real-Time First-Person Shooter Computer Game,2015,"Games are good test-beds to evaluate AI methodologies. In recent years, there has been a vast amount of research dealing with real-time computer games other than the traditional board games or card games. This paper illustrates how we create agents by employing FALCON, a self-organizing neural network that performs reinforcement learning, to play a well-known first-person shooter computer game called Unreal Tournament. Rewards used for learning are either obtained from the game environment or estimated using the temporal difference learning scheme. In this way, the agents are able to acquire proper strategies and discover the effectiveness of different weapons without any guidance or intervention. The experimental results show that our agents learn effectively and appropriately from scratch while playing the game in real-time. Moreover, with the previously learned knowledge retained, our agent is able to adapt to a different opponent in a different map within a relatively short period of time.",,第2页.xls
867,Reasoning with an Uncertainty of Information Measure: Decision Making for Military and Non-Military Applications,2018,"Intelligent agents are devices, software, and simulations that perceive the environment and take actions to achieve a goal through the use of artificial intelligence. These AI agents are increasingly incorporated into every aspect of our lives. This is particularly true for soldiers and analysts as they must increasingly perform tasks in varied, dynamic, and fast paced operational environments. There is a common idea that, in the future, the pace of operations will increasingly far exceed soldiers' or analysts' ability to react to extreme, complex activities. Accelerated decision making in Army operations will relying on AI agents and enabling technologies such as autonomous systems and simulations.However, what happens when the decisions from these AI agents are wrong, produce results contrary to expectations, or simply in disagreement with a person? Explanations can help resolve these issues. Any errors or uncertainty from the AI agent in an accelerated environment will present unique and unforeseen challenges that may potentially inhibit analysts' or soldiers' ability to make decisions effectively and efficiently. Providing explanations for AI outputs, predictions, or behaviors is challenging. Algorithms or techniques frequently obfuscate features and how actions are decided. In addition, results from these systems do not always include uncertainty information related to the factors that influenced the actions or decisions. Therefore, information on the uncertainty explicitly in the explanation is necessary.We explore the use of abductive reasoning to provide explanations for situations where an agents answers are not in line with human assessment nor provide uncertainty information needed for human interpretation of the answers. The primary goal of this work is to strengthen the communication of information and increase the effectiveness of interactions between humans and non-human agents.",,第2页.xls

869,Evaluating communication modality for improved human/autonomous system teaming,2019,"Establishing the basis for trusted autonomy through explainable AI is the goal of the ATTRACTOR Project. The DRM for ATTRACTOR is a SAR mission crewed by multiagent heterogeneous human/machine teams. To facilitate this mission, humans must be able to provide accurate and sufficient data on the mission subject to autonomous teammates. In pursuit of this, this paper explores the data collected as part of the HINGE project to ensure trusted communication between human and autonomous teammates in a multi-agent heterogeneous team. Image description data were gathered using two different input modalities and elicited in two different contexts. These descriptions were compared to established ground truth image descriptions using CIDEr and SPICE similarity metrics. They are also used to regenerate the image using a GAN in order to determine success. The differences between the contexts and modalities are then investigated using corpus linguistic techniques, LIWC, and attribute analysis. Language differences that correspond to lower or higher success rates are noted. The resulting analysis provides evidence for the type of data required by autonomous systems in order to generate an image of the subject of a SAR mission.",,第2页.xls

System for improving mechanical assembly design (SIMAD) is being implemented as an organisation of cooperating agents in a multi-agent construct. A model of cooperation based on communication, integration (of design solutions), and coordination forms the underlying framework of SIMAD. The approach has been guided by the notion that designing a complex product is a complex process necessitating a team of designers to be involved in the design process, and with team members having different perspectives or different notions as to what kind of design is best. SIMAD's architecture is based on a variation of the traditional blackboard paradigm, and uses an object-oriented model for its underlying implementation.",,第2页.xls

There is a time-line of described robot soccer strategies, which will show the trend of strategies and technologies. The basic algorithm for each robot, that is described here, morphs from just simple mechanical maneuvering strategies to biologically inspired strategies. These strategies are adapted from many realms. The realm of educational psychology, produced reinforcement learning and Q-learning, commerce produced concepts of market-driven economy, engineering with its potential field, AI with its petri-nets, neural network and fuzzy logic. Even insect and fish were simulated in PSO and have been adapted into robot soccer. All these strategies are surveyed in this paper.

874,MAEDyS: Multiagent Evolution via Dynamic Skill Selection,2021,"Evolving effective coordination strategies in tightly coupled multiagent settings with sparse team fitness evaluations is challenging. It relies on multiple agents simultaneously stumbling upon the goal state to generate a learnable feedback signal. In such settings, estimating an agent's contribution to the overall team performance is extremely difficult, leading to a well-known structural credit assignment problem. This problem is further exacerbated when agents must complete sub-tasks with added spatial and temporal constraints, and different sub-tasks may require different local skills. We introduce MAEDyS, Multiagent Evolution via Dynamic Skill Selection, a hybrid bi-level optimization framework that augments evolutionary methods with policy gradient methods to generate effective coordination policies. MAEDyS learns to dynamically switch between multiple local skills towards optimizing the team fitness. It adopts fast policy gradients to learn several local skills using dense local rewards. It utilizes an evolutionary process to optimize the delayed team fitness by recruiting the most optimal skill at any given time. The ability to switch between various local skills during an episode eliminates the need for designing heuristic mixing functions. We evaluate MAEDyS in complex multiagent coordination environments with spatial and temporal constraints and show that it outperforms prior methods.",,第2页.xls

In this paper, we present an application of genetic algorithms and flocking strategies to control the Ghost Team in the game Ms. Pac-Man. In particular, we define flocking strategies for the Ghost Team and optimize them for robustness with respect to the stochastic elements of the game and effectivity against different possible opponents by means of genetic algorithm. The performance of the methodology proposed is tested and compared with that of other standard controllers. The results show that flocking strategies are capable of modeling complex behaviors and produce effective and challenging agents.",,第2页.xls
877,A framework for the development of cooperative robotic applications,2005,"The advances in mobile robotics, computing power, and wireless communications have turned feasible the development of communities of autonomous robots. In the last years, there is a greater interest in systems of multiple autonomous robots for the accomplishment of cooperative tasks. This project takes it into account and presents an architecture for the development of collaborative applications for a heterogeneous team of mobile robots based on embedded agents. The implemented architecture has the capacity to allow the team of robots to accomplish such tasks, and also it has tools and features that allow programmers to develop complex applications in a reasonable time. An agent-based development platform has been used for this purpose, due to it integrates the necessary capabilities for developing distributed applications, and manages the communications among all the components.

To support understandability of a team of collaborating robots we use natural language to let the robots verbalize what they do and plan to do. Our solution is based on Cooperating Distributed Grammar Systems for plan derivation and a Multi-agent algorithm for coordination of robot actions. We implemented and evaluated our solution on a team of three Pepper robots that work collaboratively to move an object on a table, thereby coordinating their capabilities and actions and verbalizing their actions and intentions.

879,Developing a general framework for artificial intelligence,2008,"The primary research focus of the team KickOffTUG (a member of the robocup simulation league community) is to set up an easily portable platform for artificial intelligence, providing general, adaptive, extendable and versatile reasoning for arbitrary systems based on the agent concept. Our efforts thus comprise agent architectures, decision-making, all aspects of artificial intelligence (search, logic, planning, learning, communication; and in particular behaviour modelling, i.e. the formalization of soccer knowledge, as well as several issues of low-level robotic control. In our opinion an agent's (i.e. an entity interacting with its environment, a term which also subsumes every type of robot) general architecture can be described by two separate layers: a system base for specific tasks (which will further be called system-level) and a general control level for issues of artificial intelligence (called AI-Level). Main idea of our proposed AI-level is to provide Artificial Intelligence for different even non-robotic systems. All general aspects are discussed in the first section of this abstract. In the last months we have further demonstrated the portability by introducing the AI-Level to several concrete applications. Descriptions thereof are subject of the following paragraphs.",,第2页.xls
880,An Interaction Protocol for Mutual Assistance in Agent Teamwork,2012,"This paper proposes and explores an interaction protocol for incorporating helpful behavior into agent teamwork. In the proposed Mutual Assistance Protocol (MAP), an agent can directly assist a teammate who requests help, provided that the two agents jointly determine, based on their individual beliefs, that the expected outcome of the help act is in the interest of the team. This distributed decision is reached through a bidding sequence similar to the one in the Contract Net Protocol. The deliberation about help is approximate in that each agent only assesses the team impact of the change to its own individual plan. The paper introduces two versions of the protocol: Action MAP, in which the helper performs an action within a teammate's individual plan, and Resource MAP, in which one or more helpers provide resources to a teammate. Both versions include refinements for the handling of simultaneous help requests. A cooperative game simulation demonstrates the advantages of Action MAP over action help protocols that use unilateral decision mechanisms, and over teamwork scenarios without help. The experiments show how the team performance depends on: the teammates' mutual awareness of each other's abilities, dynamic disturbance in the environment, communication costs, and computation costs.",,第2页.xls
881,Learning formations in simulated soccer by a genetic algorithm,2000,"Multiagent systems have emerged as an active subfield of artificial intelligence in the past few years. In multiagent systems, autonomous agents are often required to collaborate towards the achievement of joint objectives. Soccer simulation provides a rich and challenging multiagent real-time domain. The soccer server system has been gaining popularity in recent years with international competitions, namely RoboCup. In the system, sensing and acting is noisy, while interagent communication is unreliable and low-bandwidth. A genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to learn formations in the simulated soccer. Collaboration among agents can be achieved through the introduction of formations as a team structure. The team agents are essentially identical agents whose behaviors differ only due to different situation-specific inputs. We obtain optimal formations using a GA-based method. In the method, roles filled by players and game modes are introduced; they limit the choice range of home positions. Through computer simulations, we show that the method obtains formations to win, corresponding to opponent formations, and is effective in learning formations.",,第2页.xls
882,Assessment of Manned-Unmanned Team Performance: Comprehensive After-Action Review Technology Development,2020,"Training in the US Army starts with the individual. Soldiers work on acquiring skills, knowledge, and attributes in order to perform tasks to support operational requirements. Feedback is provided through After-Action Reviews (AARs) to support training and improve future operations. A main difficulty for developing effective training for manned-unmanned teams (MUM-T) is that AARs with human-agent teams are yet to be developed. While AAR processes for human teams are well trained in the Army, the current methods for delivering an AAR do not account for unmanned systems that are integrated in collective tasks. The US Army's Robotic Wingman program provides a use case for discussing potential technology solutions that can support critical human factors for MUM-T during a gunnery collective task. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of an unmanned platform will help develop effective training plans and performance measures for the unmanned asset which is now part of the team.",,第2页.xls
883,Cooperation and coordination between fuzzy reinforcement learning agents in continuous state partially observable Markov decision processes,1999,"We consider a pseudo-realistic world in which one or more opportunities appear and disappear in random locations. Agents use fuzzy reinforcement learning to learn which opportunities are most worthy of pursuing based on their promised rewards, expected lifetimes, path lengths and expected path costs. We show that this world is partially observable because the history of an agent influences the distribution of its future states. We implement a coordination mechanism for allocating opportunities to different agents in the same world. Our results show that optimal team performance results when agents behave in a partially selfish way. We also implement a cooperation mechanism in which agents share experience by using and updating one joint behavior policy. Our results demonstrate that K cooperative agents each learning in a separate world for N time steps outperform K independent agents each learning in a separate world for K*N time steps, with this result becoming more pronounced as the degree of partial observability in the environment increases.",,第2页.xls

In this paper, we report on the main technical issues that we encountered and addressed in direct response to the learning and teamwork challenges stated in the IJCAI-97 challenge paper. We describe layered learning in which off-line and online, individual and collaborative, learned robotic soccer behaviors are combined hierarchically. We achieve effective teamwork through a team member agent architecture that encompasses a flexible teamwork structure. Agents are capable of decomposing the task space into flexible roles and can switch roles while acting.

886,Modeling and control of autonomous soccer robots using high-level Petri nets,2010,"Coordination of multiple autonomous robots is a typical research problem in Multi-agent systems. The distributed agent models that represent the supervisory controllers of autonomous soccer robots are capable of communication, interaction and collaboration. By introducing the multi-agent based control architecture, the soccer robots perform seamless team cooperation to achieve the desired mission during competition. Due to the multi-soccer robot system is a discrete event dynamic system with concurrent and asynchronous characteristics, the distributed agent-oriented Petri net (DAOPN) is selected in this paper to model and control the behaviors of the multi-soccer robot systems. The agent models proposed in this work consist of the coordination model and the skill oriented robot behavior models. Especially, the agent based communication places enable the distributed agent models to be communicated directly. In this manner, the DAOPN based agent models can act as the robot controllers and coordinator to perform run-time controls of the soccer robot team. Therefore, the proposed approach not only resolves problems of the multi-robot coordination, but also provides a feasible way to overcome the complicated mathematical functions or rule bases. Finally, this system is tested using four soccer robots, and the results verify the proposed DAOPN based controller.",,第2页.xls
887,Communication in Soccer Simulation: On the Use of Wiretapping Opponent Teams,2019,"Inter-agent communication has been playing an important role in soccer simulation 2D since its introduction. Its primary usage has been to communicate with teammates in order to share state observations to fill gaps in the players' world models, to announce near future actions like passes or requesting passes, as well as for sharing and synchronizing on locker room agreements. In this paper, by contrast, our focus is on the communication of the opponent team. We present an approach for wiretapping and decoding opponent communication and systematically evaluate its impact. Our main finding is that a team that wiretaps its opponent and exploits intercepted information appropriately, can boost its own playing performance significantly.",,第2页.xls

We treat the problem: How epistemic conditions will be able to settle a moral hazard in team in the principal-agent model under uncertainty. We shall propose a resolution programme for the moral hazard in the principal-agent model by common-knowledge. Let us assume that the agents have the knowledge structure induced from a binary relation associated with the multi-modal logic S5n or S4n. We show that the moral hazard can be resolved in the principal-agent model under uncertainty if the agents commonly know all their own costs.,,第2页.xls

However, despite extensive resource allocation to simulation-based training environments, and to computer generated forces that can act in those environments, there is relatively little research on how synthetic entities can best be designed and used to achieve team training objectives. In this paper, we outline the development of a research program that seeks to define principles of effective team training with synthetic entities. We describe our domain of application (Air Force AWACS Weapons Directors and the pilots they control), team training objectives, the components and capabilities of the simulation, and our plan for using the simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid team training. Ultimately, this work will result in a series of principles of effective team training with agents that can facilitate the development of hybrid training environments.",,第2页.xls
890,Performance competitions as research infrastructure: Large scale comparative studies of multi-agent teams,2003,"Performance competitions ( events that pit many different programs against each other on a standardized task) provide a way for a research community to promote research progress towards challenging goals. In this paper, we argue that for maximum research benefit, any such competition must involve comparative studies under closely controlled, varying conditions. We demonstrate the critical role of comparative studies in the context of one well-known and growing performance competition: the annual Robotic Soccer World Cup (RoboCup) Championship. Specifically, over the past three years, we have carried out annual large-scale comparative evaluations - distinct from the competition itself - of the multi-agent teams taking part in the largest RoboCup league. Our study, which involved 30 different teams of agents produced by dozens of different research groups, focused on robustness. We show that (i) multi-agent teams exhibit a clear performance-robustness tradeoff; (ii) teams tend to over-specialize, so that they cannot handle beneficial changes we make to their operating environment; and (iii) teams improve in performance more than in robustness from one year to the next, despite the emphasis by RoboCup organizers on robustness as a key challenge. These results demonstrate the potential of large-scale comparative studies for producing important results otherwise difficult to discover, and are significant both in the lessons they raise for designers of multi-agent teams, and in understanding the place of performance competitions within the multi-agent research infrastructure.",,第2页.xls
891,Performance evaluation of a mobile agent network using network calculus,2008,This paper deals with performance evaluation of a mobile agent network using network calculus. A mobile agent network includes a multi-agent system and a set of processing nodes connected by a communication network where agents reside and operate as a team. We describe such a network as a quelling system where an agent represents ail information unit to be served while nodes represent servers capable of hosting executing and communicating with agents. Ill a case study a simulation-based method for performance evaluation is proposed. Various parameters For a given scenario are analysed and the experimental results are presented.,,第2页.xls
892,On the design of coordination diagnosis algorithms for teams of situated agents,2007,"Teamwork demands agreement among team-members in order to collaborate and coordinate effectively. When a disagreement between teammates occurs (due to failures), team-members should ideally diagnose its causes, to resolve the disagreement. Such diagnosis of social failures can be expensive in communication and computation, challenges which previous work has not addressed. We present a novel design space of diagnosis algorithms, distinguishing several phases in the diagnosis process, and providing alternative algorithms for each phase. We then combine these algorithms in different ways to empirically explore spec ific design choices in a complex domain, on thousands of failure cases. The results show that different phases of diagnosis affect communication and computation overhead. In particular, centralizing the diagnosis disambiguation process is a key factor in reducing communications, while runtime is affected mainly by the amount of reasoning about other agents. These results contrast with previous work in disagreement detection (without diagnosis), in which distributed algorithms reduce communications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第2页.xls

895,Functionality and Performance Issues in an Agent-Based Software Deployment Framework,2009,"Deploying and maintaining software in a distributed system includes software delivery, remote installation, starting, stoping, and modifying in order to configure or re-configure a system according to user needs. This paper deals with an agent-based framework where intelligent and mobile, agents provide the means to implement a, distributed system and enable its evolution by taking partial or full responsibility for software deployment tasks. Agents are organised into agent teams, where one agent is the team leader responsible for planning, while the others are operational agents capable of executing a defined plan. The formal model, as well as functionality and performance issues, are elaborated. Special attention is paid to deployment strategies and their optimization, while taking into account characteristics or distributed system nodes and the network connecting them. Simulation-based evaluation of agent serialization, migration and deserialization parameters. and their influence on overall performance, is included.",,第2页.xls
896,Multi-agent Systems Meet Aggregate Programming: Towards a Notion of Aggregate Plan,2015,"Recent works foster the idea of engineering distributed situated systems by taking an aggregate stance: design and development are better conducted by abstracting away from individuals' details, directly programming overall system behaviour instead. Concerns like interaction protocols, self-organisation, adaptation, and large-scaleness, are automatically hidden under the hood of the platform supporting aggregate programming. This paper aims at bridging the apparently significant gap between this idea and agent autonomy, paving the way towards an aggregate computing approach for multi-agent systems. Specifically, we introduce and analyse the idea of aggregate plan: a collective plan to be played by a dynamic team of cooperating agents.",,第2页.xls
897,Understanding the Influences of Past Experience on Trust in Human-agent Teamwork,2019,"People use the knowledge acquired from past experiences in assessing the trustworthiness of a trustee. In a time where the agents are being increasingly accepted as partners in collaborative efforts and activities, it is critical to understand all aspects of human trust development in agent partners. For human-agent virtual ad hoc teams to be effective, humans must be able to trust their agent counterparts. To earn the humans' trust, agents need to quickly develop an understanding of the expectation of human team members and adapt accordingly. This study empirically investigates the impact of past experience on human trust in and reliance on agent teammates. To do so, we developed a team coordination game, the Game of Trust (GoT), in which two players repeatedly cooperate to complete team tasks without prior assignment of subtasks. The effects of past experience on human trust are evaluated by performing an extensive set of controlled experiments with participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing marketplace. We collect both teamwork performance data as well as surveys to gauge participants' trust in their agent teammates. The results show that positive (negative) past experience increases (decreases) human trust in agent teammates; lack of past experience leads to higher trust levels compared to positive past experience; positive (negative) past experience facilitates (hinders) reliance on agent teammates; the relationship between trust in and reliance on agent teammates is not always correlated. These findings provide clear and significant evidence of the influence of key factors on human trust in virtual agent teammates and enhance our understanding of the changes in human trust in peer-level agent teammates with respect to past experience.",,第2页.xls
898,An Agent-Based Model of Collective Decision-Making: How Information Sharing Strategies Scale With Information Overload,2020,"Organizations rely on teams for complex decision-making. By bringing diverse information together and utilizing information sharing strategies, teams can make intelligent decisions. However, as organizations face increasing information overload, it has become unclear whether such strategies remain adequate or whether bounds on human rationality will prevail. We develop an agent-based model that simulates information sharing in teams, where critical information is distributed across its members. We tested how robust various information sharing strategies are to information overload and bounds on rationality in terms of the speed and accuracy of collective decision-making. Our results suggest distinct strategies depending on whether speed or accuracy is imperative and, more broadly, shed light on how intelligence is best attained in collective decision-making.",,第2页.xls
899,Coherent social action,1994,"Formal analyses of social action for distributed AI (DAI) have focussed, almost exclusively, on scenarios in which participating agents have a joint intention to act. While such scenarios are significant, there are many examples of artificial and natural social systems in which joint intention not only does not occur, but is not even a practical possibility. This paper proposes that a deep theory of social action should account for the whole spectrum of social action types within the same framework. It is argued that coherence is an attribute which unifies different types of social action, and is therefore a possible starting point for a deep theory. A discussion and subsequent formalisation of coherence is then presented. This model of coherence is used as the foundation upon which to build a new formalisation of team action. The framework in which these formalisations are presented is a new quantified multimodal logic.",,第2页.xls
900,Comparisons on Scrum Team Pairing Strategies: A multi-agent Simulation,2020,"Scrum is a type of agile process that incrementally, iteratively and continuously deliver software based on sprint time box. It is composed by User Stories, product backlog, sprint backlog, scrum team and sprints. Scrum team take user stories from product backlog into sprint backlog to start each sprint and deliver products at the end of each sprint. Sprint retrospective and review occurs at the end of each sprint to evaluate the delivered products and team performance. Based on the Scrum guide, scrum is easy to be understood but hard to be measured. Especially, it is depended largely on the performance of team dynamics referring to team compositions and task allocations, as its optimization make big impact on each sprint result. A simulation tool is also designed and developed to carry on scrum team modelling and simulation which has realized all the designed strategies to carry on experiments and evaluation. The tool (Z.

901,Modeling user perception of interaction opportunities for effective teamwork,2009,"This paper presents a model of collaborative decision-making for groups that involve people and computer agents. The model distinguishes between actions relating to participants commitment to the group and actions relating to their individual tasks, uses this distinction to decompose group decision making into smaller problems that can be solved efficiently. It allows computer agents to reason about the benefits of their actions on a collaboration and the ways in which human participants perceive these benefits. The model was tested in a setting in which computer agents need to decide whether to interrupt people to obtain potentially valuable information. Results show that the magnitude of the benefit of interruption to the collaboration is a major factor influencing the likelihood that people will accept interruption requests. They further establish that peoples perceived type of their partners (whether humans or computers) significantly affected their perceptions of the usefulness of interruptions when the benefit of the interruption is not clear-cut. These results imply that system designers need to consider not only the possible benefits of interruptions to collaborative human-computer teams but also the way that such benefits are perceived by people.",,第2页.xls
902,Optimal control and game theoretic approaches to cooperative control of a team of multi-vehicle unmanned systems,2007,"The main goal of this work is to design a team of multi-agent unmanned vehicles that can accomplish consensus over a common value for vehicles' output in a leaderless topology. The interaction between agents due to information exchange is modelled in the characterization of the dynamical model of each agent. The main approach to the problem is based on cooperative game theory, however in order to clarify the cooperative nature of the method, two approaches to this problem are considered: First a semi-decentralized optimal control strategy is designed based on minimization of individual costs using local information. Next, cooperative game theory is used to ensure the team cooperation by combining individual cost into a team cost function. This cooperative solution needs the full information of the team but results in lower cost for each agent. The choice of Nash-bargaining solution among a set of Pareto-efficient solutions for this cooperative game guarantees minimum individual cost by maximizing the difference between the cooperative (centralized) and non-cooperative (semi-decentralized) individual cost.",,第2页.xls

Then, we develop BDO logic and its formal semantics, syntactically import reward, punish, commit and decommit, and give descriptions for such societal concepts as team, organization, and organizational intention. Finally, we review several representative works on BDI agent and make comparison between them and our works here. We regard BDO logic as an improvement of the famous BDI logic and as a more expressive framework for the description of social agents and group concepts.",,第2页.xls

906,Comparison of sampling sizes for the co-evolution of cooperative agents,2003,"The evolution of a heterogeneous team behavior can be a very demanding task. In order to promote the greatest level of specialization team members should be evolved in separate populations. The greatest complication in the evolution of separate populations is finding suitable partners for evaluation at trial time. If too few combinations are tested, the Genetic Algorithm loses its ability to recognize possible solutions and if too many combinations are tested the algorithm becomes too computationally expensive. In previous work a method of punctuated anytime learning was employed to test all combinations of possible partners at periodic generations to reduce the number of evaluations. In further work, it was found that by varying the number of combinations tested, the sample size, the GA could produce an accurate and even less computationally expensive solution. In this paper, we compare different sampling sizes to determine the most effective approach to finding the solution. We use a box pushing task to compare these different sampling sizes.",,第2页.xls

909,Using a Team of General AI Algorithms to Assist Game Design and Testing,2018,"General Video Game Playing (GVGP) has become a popular line of research in the past years, leading to the existence of a wide range of general algorithms created to tackle this challenge. This paper proposes taking advantage of this research to help in game design and testing processes. It introduces a methodology consisting of using a team of Artificial General Intelligence agents with differentiated goals (winning, exploring, collecting items, killing NPCs, etc.) and skill levels. Using several agents with distinct behaviours that play the same game simultaneously can provide substantial information to influence design and bug fixing. Two methods are proposed to aid game design: 1) the evaluation of a game based on the expected performance in the behaviour of each of the agents, and 2) the provision of visual information to analyse how the experience of the agents evolves during the play-through. Having this methodology available to designers can help them decide if the game or level under analysis fits the initial expectations. Including a Logging System can also be used to detect anomalies while the development is still at an early stage. We believe this approach allows the flexibility and portability to be easily applied to games with different characteristics.",,第2页.xls

911,SEMAT Essence's Kernel applied to O-MaSE,2016,"Developing complex systems can be simplified if the designer is guided by a method from Software Engineering. Currently, Agent Oriented Software Engineering methods aim at providing an adaptive engineering process. The method processes have been broken up into different parts called fragments, enabling the mix of different engineering processes' parts to get better adequacy between the system to be done and the process. However, some difficulties remain on the expertise needed to compose these fragments when a number of fragments prevent the composition to be done by hand. The difference between how each method is described is also an obstacle. SEMAT is an initiative to reshape software engineering such that software engineering qualifies as a rigorous discipline, which can facilitate the composition of methods. The first step ends up with a Kernel called Essence adopted as an OMG standard in June 2014. Different software constructors like Red Hat, Google have already applied this kernel to redefine some of their methods and processes. Our aim in this paper is to apply a first recast to OMaSE in terms of the Essence kernel toward an evaluation of its relevance to building a common ground kernel for MAS methodologies.",,第2页.xls

The approach of SAIL is to integrate existing autonomous systems in a framework, that serves as a social layer between autonomous systems and human team members. The social layer contains reusable modules to provide social capabilities enabling teamwork.

It consists of a robot middleware (Player) and a multi-agent development environment (JADE). Such components provide off-the-shelf tools which allow a straightforward implementation of indoor localization and navigation tasks for a team of mobile robots. Such integration combines proven mobile robot algorithms with a distributed infrastructure, and extends the capabilities from a robot alone to a whole team of robots, thus allowing the development of cooperative applications. As a proof of concept, an auction-like goal assignment task is presented: the robot team is given a goal, and each robot proposes an estimated cost for achieving it, then the best proposal is selected. Most of the control flow is automated by the JADE standard interaction protocols. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages of combining both frameworks, for a practical yet sound development of multi-robot applications.",,第2页.xls
914,An agent-based simulation model of human-robot team performance in military environments,2013,"Prior to deploying human-robot teams on military missions, system designers need to understand how design decisions affect team performance. This paper describes a multiagent simulation model that captures both team coordination and human-robot interaction. The purpose of the model is to evaluate proposed team designs in uncertain Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) scenarios and determine which design factors are most critical to team performance. The simulation model is intended to be a tool in the systems engineering iterations of proposing designs, testing them, and then evaluating them during the conceptual design phase. To illustrate the model's usefulness for this purpose, a fractional factorial design of experiments is conducted to evaluate team design factors and the two-factor interaction between controllable factors and noise factors that described the environment and robot reliability. The experimental results suggest that (1) larger teams have more robust performance over the noise factors, (2) robot reliability is critical to the formation of human-robot teams, and (3) high centralization of decision-making authority created communication bottlenecks at the commander in large teams. This work contributes to the agent-based modeling of teams, and to understanding how the U.S. Army can attain its goal of greater utilization of robots in future military operations.

919,Modeling Cognitive Loads for Evolving Shared Mental Models in Human-Agent Collaboration,2011,"Recent research on human-centered teamwork highly demands the design of cognitive agents that can model and exploit human partners' cognitive load to enhance team performance. In this paper, we focus on teams composed of human-agent pairs and develop a system called Shared Mental Models for all-SMMall. SMMall implements a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based cognitive load model for an agent to predict its human partner's instantaneous cognitive load status. It also implements a user interface (UI) concept called shared belief map, which offers a synergic representation of team members' information space and allows them to share beliefs. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the HMM-based load models. The results indicate that the HMM-based load models are effective in helping team members develop a shared mental model (SMM), and the benefit of load-based information sharing becomes more significant as communication capacity increases. It also suggests that multiparty communication plays an important role in forming/evolving team SMMs, and when a group of agents can be partitioned into subteams, splitting messages by their load status can be more effective for developing subteam SMMs.",,第2页.xls
920,Agents with limited modeling abilities: Implications on collaborative problem solving,2006,"Collaboration plays a critical role when a group is striving for goals which are difficult or impossible to achieve by an individual. Knowledge about collaborators' contributions to a task is important when solving problems as a team. However, a problem in many collaboration scenarios is the uncertainty and incompleteness of such knowledge. To investigate this problem, we present a collaboration framework where team members use models of collaborators' performance to estimate contributions to a task, and propose agents for tasks based on these estimations. We conducted a simulation-based study to assess the impact of modeling limitations on task performance. The main results of our simulation are that maintaining models of agents improves task performance, but exhaustive model maintenance is not essential. Additionally, we found that the ability of agents to update their models has a large impact on task performance. We then extended our framework to support more refined agent models, and performed additional simulated studies. Our results indicated that task performance is improved by the availability of additional reasoning resources and the use of probabilistic models that represent variable agent performance.",,第2页.xls
921,A distributed architecture for effective multirobot cooperation in team competitions,1999,"The research of multiagent systems has been widely studied for many years, however, the topic of multirobot team competitions has not been extensively investigated, In this paper, the authors propose a fully distributed, behavior-based software architecture termed Emerge, which facilitates flexible and reliable coordination on a team of robots performing tasks that may be subverted by another team of robots. Emerge enables the robots to achieve flexible action selections through the use of four mathematically-modeled motivations (practicability, feasibility, tendency and execution priority). With the aid of these motivations, the human knowledge, which usually involves a number of fuzzy concepts, may be conveniently merged to the robot team by following a clear and logical design procedure. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated through an example an a team of robots performing a simulated 3-on-3 robot soccer game.",,第2页.xls
922,A novel conceptual model facilitating the derivation of agent-based models for analyzing socio-technical optimality gaps in the energy domain,2017,"Optimization and simulation models are fit to work on a multitude of technical, economic, and techno-economic questions. However, they are by now not able to satisfactorily include societal aspects like acceptance, spatial implications and legal frameworks. In order to advance scope and explanatory power of simulation models, collaboration in interdisciplinary research teams is needed. Yet the exchange in such teams and its coordination can prove challenging. Furthermore, disciplinary approaches and methods for simulation and optimization might not be familiar to all participants.To this end, a new conceptual model is introduced. The conceptual model employs few basic elements and concepts for describing and explaining arbitrary societal and technical relationships. Most notably, the conceptual model is general in its design, so contributions to the problem formulation and design components can be made by all team members regardless of their discipline. The procedure is based on common agent-based concepts without using their terminology. Consequently, an exchange among all team members becomes possible without them necessarily being proficient in agent-based modeling. A reduced presentation of workshop results exemplifies the use of novel elements for deriving an emergent agent-based simulation. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,第2页.xls
923,Cooperative Human-Robot Planning with Team Reasoning,2017,"The paper studies the connections between philosophical action theory and planning methods in artificial intelligence. It proposes a method of cooperative planning in which agents select actions using a combination of planning and team reasoning. Whereas several standard approaches to multi-agent planning start from individuals' plans and try to combine them into a group plan, the proposed method starts from constructing a group plan from which the individuals derive their sub-plans. The former method is labelled I-mode planning and the latter we-mode planning. The basic idea of the proposed we-mode planning method is that the agents conceive themselves as a group agent that selects the best plan specifying the actions of all individual agents who then carry out their parts in the group plan. We-mode planning is suited for human-robot cooperation in situations in which the participants have a shared goal and a shared plan evaluation function, and can observe each others' actions. The method is expected to lead in some cases to more human-like robot behaviour and more efficient execution of joint actions in human-robot teams.",,第2页.xls
924,Human-agent societies: challenges and issues,2015,"Agreement technologies have settled the foundations for creating systems that operate on the basis of agreements in societies of independent, autonomous computational entities (agents). Nowadays more and more systems of such kind rely on a seamless interaction of software agents with humans. Humans work in partnership or closely related with agents that are able to act autonomously and intelligently. Specifically, humans and agents have the ability to establish a series of relationships/collaborative interactions with each other, foming what might be called human-agent teams to meet their individual or collective goals within an organisation or social structure. Systems in which people and agents operate on a large scale offer an enormous potential but also require the consideration of additional issues. In this paper we present our vision of human-agent societies. Based on a real-wond case study, we analyse the open issues that should be addressed by researches in order to develop such systems. Finally, we present an abstract architecture proposal for intelligent human-agent societies, which is centred on a service onented framework that enables the interactions among the different components in such systems.",,第2页.xls
925,Artificial emotion and its applications,2004,"The natural emotion plays a significant role in human behavior. Current research in AI shows an increasing interest in artificial emotion for developing the human-like agent. In this paper a survey of basic issues of artificial emotion from the engineering point of view is given, briefly introducing several emotion models with emphasis on typical implementations of artificial emotion-based agent architecture. Research on artificial emotion is reflected in the human-computer interaction (HCI) such as emotion identification and emotion expression, the action mechanism of emotion also influences the control architecture and algorithm design of the intelligent agent. The emotion-based architecture being hybrid-layered emphasizes the links between emotion and other processes to enhance adaptive capability of agents in a dynamic environment. In the architecture the central role of artificial emotion is incarnated mainly in two aspects: First, the artificial emotion is the basis of connecting internal status of an agent with its external situation, and emotion affects the whole process of information processing, including both the quick response in an emergency and the complicated reasoning for planning a task; Second, the artificial emotion as an endogenous teaching device plays a crucial role in the learning process, stimulating an agent to create more complex behavioral functions. Embedding artificial emotion in the architecture is essential for agents to be more intelligent and personalized.",,第2页.xls
926,Negotiated and reciprocal exchange structures in human-agent cooperation,2019,"In light of increasing automation capability, Social Exchange Theory may help guide the design of automated digital interlocutors in human-agent teaming to enhance joint performance. The effect of two social exchange structures, negotiated exchange and reciprocal exchange, was assessed using a joint scheduling microworld environment. Negotiated exchange was operationalized as a bilateral requesting-and-accepting interaction in the microworld, and reciprocal exchange was operationalized as a unilateral resource-providing interaction in the microworld. Compared to the negotiated exchange structure, the reciprocal exchange structure led to increased resource-sharing by both the participant and agent, and thus higher joint performance in the microworld task. The reciprocal exchange structure thus enhanced performance by reducing communication overhead, facilitating proactive and increased resource-sharing. However, results also suggest participant resource-sharing was more mindless than strategic, and failed to consider agent needs. This study demonstrates a new approach to conceptualizing the social mechanisms of human-automation interaction for enhanced human-agent teaming. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第2页.xls
927,Encouraging Attacker Retreat through Defender Cooperation,2011,"This paper is motivated by a desire to develop analytic formulations for adversarial interactions between an attacker and a defensive team. We analyze a multi-stage, two-player game in which one player represents an attacker with superior dynamic characteristics and the other player represents a team consisting of a mobile, high-value target and N protective agents. At the start of the game, the attacker must decide whether to engage the target or retreat. The defending team must then decide whether to maximize or minimize the attacker's cost in response. These decisions are referred to as the players' intent. After each side has selected an intent, a differential pursuit-evasion game is played in which the value represents the integral cost to the attacker. Within the differential game, the terminal conditions and the players' optimal control strategies are dictated by the previous intent selections. We obtain the optimal intent strategies in terms of the differential game values and relevant bonus and penalty values. We solve the differential games by developing the optimality conditions for the equilibrium control strategies. We show that for certain conditions, the defenders should cooperate with the attacker so that retreat becomes the most attractive option; thereby, fulfilling the defensive goal of protecting the high-value target.",,第2页.xls
928,The Winning Advantage: Using Opponent Models in Robot Soccer,2009,"Opponent modeling is a skill in multi-agent systems (MAS) which attempts to create a model of the behavior of the opponent.

Several researches present different methods to create an opponent model in the RoboCup environment. However, how these models can impact the performance of teams is an essential aspect;. This paper introduces a, novel approach to use efficiently opponent, models in order to improve our own team behavior The basis of this approach is the research done by CAOS Coach Team for modeling and recognizing behaviors evaluated in the RoboCup Coach Competition 2006. For using these models, it is necessary a special agent (coach) which can model the observed opponent; team (based oil the previous research) and communicate a counter-strategy to the coached players (using the approach proposed in this paper).

Structure and modeling steps of the simulation were studied, the proposed simulation method was applied in a motorcycle engine box production cell, and the system performance under the two different organizational strategies 'specialized division of labor' and 'multi-skill team' was compared. The results indicate that the agent-based simulation method can simulate the organizational strategy in production cells, and provide a new way to study affecting mechanism of different organizational strategies on prodution cells.",,第2页.xls
930,Novel Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Simulation Method to Study Synthetic Agents and Standardize Human-Machine Teams (HMT),2020,"Featured ApplicationThis work can be used to develop reliable intelligent systems that have the capabilities to integrate in human-machine teams in dealing with time sensitive situations.This work presents a multi-year study conducted at the University of Toledo, aimed at improving human-machine teaming (HMT) methods and technologies. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in 21st-century machines, collaboration between humans and machines has become highly complicated for real-time applications. The penetration of intelligent and synthetic assistants (IA/SA) in virtually every field has opened up a path to the area of HMT. When it comes to crucial tasks such as patient treatment/care, industrial production, and defense, the use of non-standardized HMT technologies may pose a risk to human lives and cost billions of taxpayer dollars. A thorough literature survey revealed that there are not many established standards or benchmarks for HMT. In this paper, we propose a method to design an HMT based on a generalized architecture. This design includes the development of an intelligent collaborative system and the human team. Followed by the identification of processes and metrics to test and validate the proposed model, we present a novel human-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation method. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using two controlled HMT scenarios: Emergency care provider (ECP) training and patient treatment by an experienced medic. Both scenarios include humans processing visual data and performing actions that represent real-world applications while responding to a Voice-Based Synthetic Assistant (VBSA) as a collaborator that keeps track of actions. The impact of various machines, humans, and HMT parameters is presented from the perspective of performance, rules, roles, and operational limitations. The proposed HIL method was found to assist in standardization studies in the pursuit of HMT benchmarking for critical applications. Finally, we present guidelines for designing and benchmarking HMTs based on the case studies' results analysis.",,第2页.xls
931,Allocative auctions: an application context for CSCW and intelligent agents,1999,"This paper describes an online auction system (OAS), designed for the allocation of M items among N parties. We strive to distribute one item per party while maximizing the overall preference of all participants. The specific application context is in the distribution of student projects among student teams. OAS is intended to support group decision-making among the teams, in distributing their preferences among projects. The system offers several advantages as a solution to our allocation problem. First, preference points are used to elicit preference levels of student teams for the projects. This scheme offers greater flexibility and granularity than conventional rank ordering. Second, users participate actively in bidding, using partial knowledge of the other teams' preferences. This should help ameliorate situations in which most preferences coalesce into a few popular projects. Third, the final allocation is chosen to maximize the average normalized scorea metric which reflects the overall preference level. Finally, OAS is a groupware which facilitates CSCW for time-synchronous but possibly geographically-distributed usage. We have enhanced the system such that a user can freely choose to bid in person, or delegate the task to an intelligent agent by specifying the bidding strategy through a prescribed set of parameters.",,第2页.xls

937,GOBEAT: Towards a Methodology to Support MAS Test Case Definition,2023,"Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that works with distributed systems whose components are autonomous entities called agents. The soccer game has been used as a test bed to stimulate research in the MAS. A soccer team, i.e., a MAS, is composed of a group of players, i.e., agents, who should coordinate their actions towards a goal. The testing process in MASs has proven to be challenging. Autonomous agents are programmed to learn during their execution. So, running the same test scenario successively can lead to different results. It makes difficult the application of conventional software testing techniques. This paper proposes the Goal Behavioral Agent Testing (GoBeAT) methodology to assist in specifying the MAS test suite applied to the robot soccer domain. GoBeAT was tested in a case study by a robot soccer team of the Robotic World Cup (RoboCup) and showed positive results in the definition of a test suit.",,第2页.xls

942,Simulating situated work,2011,"This paper describes computational models of situated work in complex, heterogeneous dynamic systems that include humans, physical systems, computer agents and regulatory requirements, using aviation as the domain being examined but highlighting modeling principles generalizable to other domains. Work is defined formally here as purposeful activity acting on, and responding to, the environment as required by the situation. This work is performed by a team of automated and human agents, and involves both cognitive and physical activity. At its most atomic, work may be represented as actions that evaluate the current situation, and then act on the environment, as well as teamwork actions and decision actions whereby agents evaluate the situation to select the appropriate sets of actions (i.e. strategies). Work is thus a response to the situation, with strategies chosen in response to the physical environment, the allocation of responsibility within the team; and agent status including expertise, the demands on the agent, and resources available to the agent such as time and information. In addition, a description of the structures inherent to work is also used to organize the actions into an abstraction hierarchy: at the bottom are the resources and actions, but at higher levels of abstraction more aggregate functions provide descriptions that relate the detailed actions to the specific goals of the work. Historically, such models have been used qualitatively, but had a disconnect from computational modeling of situated behavior. Therefore, this paper details how they may be dynamically simulated to examine how work can be studied dynamically as situated within a dynamic environment driving, and responding to, agent activity.",,第2页.xls

944,Controlling a team of unmanned underwater vehicles performing water region search tasks,2013,"The article discusses a problem of performing a mission and controlling a team of unmanned underwater vehicles which perform a task of water region search. The team of underwater vehicles has been modelled as a multi-agent system, which made it possible to use the mechanism of multi-agent systems for controlling the team of cooperating underwater vehicles, with each vehicle being treated as an individual agent. Solutions to cooperation problems in multi-agent systems were proposed, including the presentation of the system structure and the data exchange method. Issues relating to cooperation actions in the team of underwater vehicles were described and solved using the theory of games and the vector quality index. The process of negotiations between the vehicles was modelled as the multiplayer cooperative game, which secured successful realisation of the task performed by the team of vehicles with respect to time, which represents the economic aspect of the task. The optimal solution was selected based on the vector quality index, which provided opportunities for minimisation of costs having the form of energy used by the entire team, and maximisation of profits in the form of time needed for completing the water region search task. The proposed method for dividing the action space in the water region search tasks performed by the team of underwater vehicles consists in assigning to each of cooperating underwater vehicles a task the realisation of which contributes to the realisation of the globally defined task. Finally, the results of water region search tasks performed by a team of cooperating underwater vehicles are presented and discussed taking into account possible vehicle failures happening during task realisation.",,第2页.xls

947,Forecasting Evolution of Clusters in Game Agents with Hebbian Learning,2023,"Large multi-agent systems such as real-time strategy games are often driven by collective behavior of agents. For example, in StarCraft II, human players group spatially near agents into a team and control the team to defeat opponents. In this light, clustering the agents in the game has been used for various purposes such as the efficient control of the agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning and game analytic tools for the game users. However, despite the useful information provided by clustering, learning the dynamics of multi-agent systems at a cluster level has been rarely studied yet. In this paper, we present a hybrid AI model that couples unsupervised and self-supervised learning to forecast evolution of the clusters in StarCraft II. We develop an unsupervised Hebbian learning method in a set-to-cluster module to efficiently create a variable number of the clusters with lower inference time complexity than K-means clustering. Also, a long short-term memory based prediction module is designed to recursively forecast state vectors generated by the set-to-cluster module to define cluster configuration. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed model successfully predicts complex movement of the clusters in the game.",,第2页.xls

950,TIMELY: Providing In-Time and Intelligent Support for Cardiovascular Rehabilitation with 'Patients and Practitioners in the Loop' Interaction,2023,"eHealth has the potential to enhance patient engagement and communication between patients and healthcare providers during Cardiovascular Rehabilitation (CR) programs. Using technological tools such as smartphone apps, physical activity trackers and medical-grade devices like heart rate and ECG monitors has been demonstrated to be effective in improving adherence and exercise capacity and in some cases achieving outcomes that are equivalent to or better than those of center-based CR programs. Multidisciplinary teams can provide patients with the support they need to make healthy lifestyle changes and address behavioral and risk factors that may contribute to cardiovascular issues. By implementing healthy behaviors, patients can also reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and improve overall mortality rates.

954,Automating Privilege Escalation with Deep Reinforcement Learning,2021,"AI-based defensive solutions are necessary to defend networks and information assets against intelligent automated attacks. Gathering enough realistic data for training machine learning-based defenses is a significant practical challenge. An intelligent red teaming agent capable of performing realistic attacks can alleviate this problem. However, there is little scientific evidence demonstrating the feasibility of fully automated attacks using machine learning. In this work, we exemplify the potential threat of malicious actors using deep reinforcement learning to train automated agents. We present an agent that uses a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm to perform local privilege escalation. Our results show that the autonomous agent can escalate privileges in a Windows~7 environment using a wide variety of different techniques depending on the environment configuration it encounters. Hence, our agent is usable for generating realistic attack sensor data for training and evaluating intrusion detection systems.",,第2页.xls

Global nonlinear consensus protocols augmented with a variable structure are constructed with the aid of Lyapunov functions for each single-integrator agent dynamics in the presence of external disturbances. In particular, it is shown that the finite settling time of the proposed general framework for robust consensus design is upper bounded for any initial condition. This makes it possible for network consensus problems to design and estimate the convergence time offline for a multi-agent team with a given undirected information flow. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our finite-time protocols.",,第2页.xls

Dating from the mid-1980s, the Belief-Desire-Intention architecture (BDI) is the longest-standing model of intelligent agency used in multi-agent systems. Part of the attraction of BDI is that it is amenable to logical formalisms such as Wooldridge's Logic Of Rational Agents (LORA). In a previous paper the present authors introduced a model of trust, here named the Ability-Belief-Commitment-Desire (ABCD) model, that could be implemented within the BDI framework. This paper explores the definition of the ABCD model within the LORA formalism.",,第2页.xls

In this paper, a population-based and an agent-based model of this process are proposed, and applied to a case study in aviation. A number of relevant simulations of the models are performed, to investigate whether the behaviour of the population-based model can approximate the pattern produced by the agent-based model. It was demonstrated that, especially for larger populations, the dynamics of the agent-based simulations can be approximated by population-based simulations, since both models demonstrate a similar pattern.",,第2页.xls

This method enables a robot to perform flexible cooperation based on the global evaluation of the achievement of objectives. Each robot communicates qualitative evaluation on the achievement level of each objective. Each robot calculates the global evaluation on the achievement of the team objective from the individual evaluation. The evaluation on the objective achievement is abstracted in order to reduce the influence of variation of the evaluation value and the communication load. As an example, the method is applied to the EIGEN team robots for the Middle Size League of RoboCup, since it is necessary for the soccer robots to cooperate each other in dynamic environment. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through the RoboCup 2004 competition.",,第2页.xls

965,SAMBAagent-supported visual interactive control for distributed team building and empowerment,1999,"Using computers to co-ordinate work is meant to improve the efficiency of distributed teams, but has the potential to decrease effectiveness by fragmenting work into seemingly unrelated tasks. It can also replace team-based communication activities such as workload negotiation, which will make workers feel isolated and not in control of their work. If the workforce is demotivated, customer service quality and employee job satisfaction will suffer. The paper shows how workload negotiation and informal team-building activities can be integrated with an operational support system for workload control and job scheduling. A proof-of-concept demonstrator called SAMBA has been built. The demonstrator uses agent based negotiation strategies and allows workers and team managers to control the system in a visual interactive fashion. This type of system could be used to enable workers to set work preferences, trade jobs, share knowledge as well as build informal alliances to help each other with their work. Managers will be able to review and control local business rules and scheduling preferences. The approach presented in SAMBA can be generalised to support team based collaboration in environments where team members have different perspectives on the collaboration process and artefact, e.g. call centre staff could control call routeing preferences, on-job training scheduling and so on.",,第2页.xls
966,Increased plasma and tissue guanidino compounds in a mouse model of hyperargininemia,2008,"In humans, arginase I (AI)-deficiency results in hyperargininemia, a metabolic disorder with symptoms of progressive neurological and intellectual impairment, spasticity, persistent growth retardation, and episodic hyperammonemia. A deficiency of arginase 11 (All) has never been detected and the clinical disorder, if any, associated with its deficiency has not been defined. Since the spasticity and paucity of hyperammonemic crises seen in human Al-deficient patients are not features of the other urea cycle disorders, the likelihood of ammonia as the main neuropathogenic agent becomes extremely low, and the modest elevations of arginine seen in the brains of our mouse model of hyperargininernia make it an unlikely candidate as well.Specific guanidino compounds, direct or indirect metabolites of arginine, are elevated in the blood of patients with uremia. Other guanidino compounds are also increased in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of hyperargininemic patients making them plausible as neurotoxins in these disorders. We analyzed several guanidino compounds in our arginase single and double knockout animals and found that a-keto-6-guanidinovaleric acid, alpha-N-acetylarginine, and argininic acid were increased in the brain tissue from the AI knockout and double knockout animals. Several compounds were also increased in the plasma, liver, and kidneys. This is the first time that several of the guanidino compounds have been shown to be elevated in the brain tissue of an arginase-deficient mammal, and it further supports their possible role as the neuropathogenic agents responsible for the complications seen in arginase deficiency.

968,"Wolves, bees, and football: enhancing coordination in sociotechnological problem solving systems through the study of human and animal groups",2007,"This paper describes how sociotechnological systems comprising human and technological agents can be considered problem solving systems. Problem solving systems typically comprise many agents, each characterized by at least partial autonomy. A challenge for problem solving systems is to coordinate system agent operations during problem solving. This paper explores how competence models of human-human and animal-animal coordination might be used to inform the design of problem solving systems so that the potential for agent coordination is enhanced. System design principles are identified based on a review of competent coordination in human groups, such as work and sport teams, and animal groups, such wolf packs and bee colonies. These principles are then discussed in relation to agent coordination in the domains of E-Science, future combat systems, and medicine, which typify real-world environments comprising problem solving systems.",,第2页.xls
969,"The need to move away from agential-AI: Empirical investigations, useful concepts and open issues",2021,"We propose a novel approach to human interaction with artificial intelligence systems (HAII), alternative to the mainstream dyadic one where humans and AI are seen as interacting agents. Through two quantitative experiments and two qualitative in-field case studies, we show that the mainstream HAII paradigm presents potentially harmful design shortcomings as it can trigger negative dynamics such as automation bias and prejudices. Our proposal, on the other hand, is grounded in the Computer-Supported Cooperative Work literature, in which AI can be conceived as a component of a Knowledge Artifact (KA). This consists of an ecosystem of knowledge creation tools whose goal is to support a Ba (after Nonaka), i.e. a collective of competent decision makers. We highlight the cooperative nature of decision making and the AI functionalities that a KA should embed. These include eXplainable AI solutions, aimed at facilitating appropriation, but also functionalities that enable reasoning in a collaborative setting. Finally, we discuss how moving intelligence and agency from individual agents to the human collective can help to mitigate the shortcomings of dyadic HAII (e.g., deskilling), redistribute responsibility in critical tasks, and revisit the HAII research agenda to align it with the needs of increasingly wide, heterogeneous and complex teams.",,第2页.xls
970,The Development of an Agent Based Modeling Framework for Simulating of Building Consultant Teamwork,2013,"The issue of human health with environmental safety has always been critically important aspect in human life. Especially when it comes to the issue of the effects and threats posed by risk of disasters which causes devastation and destruction to humans' health and ecological regions. Disaster is a combination of natural or artificial threats and human activities. Vulnerability to be result from the lack of appropriate disaster management plans, which leads to financial, infrastructural, economical, social and human damages and destructions on a large scale. However, team working simulation has become supremely important in modern organizations due to its beneficial outcomes. However, teamwork performance levels are determined by, namely: the complexity of interaction and coordination between the attributes of its individual members, the communication and dynamics between team members, the working environment, as well as the team working tasks. As building industries and organizations evolve, so also does the interactive nature of their teamwork communication. Product developments have been increasingly undertaken by a multidisciplinary integrated unit of teams. Such increasing complexity means that the interactive nature of methods for studying teamwork must also evolve as a sound research area of study, especially towards the building construction industries. The main objective of this paper focuses on the use of an agent-based modeling (ABS) concept of approach towards the simulation of building consultant teamwork in the construction industry.",,第2页.xls
971,Groups and societies: One and the same thing?,1998,"To answer this question, we propose a general model of coordination in Multi-Agent Systems. Autonomous agents first recognise how they depend on each other (they may need or prefer to interact about the same or different goals), and then, in the negotiation phase, exchange offers in the form of commissive speech acts. Finally, agents adopt social, interlocking, commitments if an agreement is reached.Joint plans are seen as deals and team activity as a special case of social activity in which, having agents the same common goal, every possible deal is profitable. Consequently, notions traditionally involved in Cooperative Problem Solving such as help and joint responsibility are applied to any social interaction. Therefore, the answer to our question is yes.",,第2页.xls
972,Intelligent command and control of large fire incidents,1991,"The Design Information Research Team (DIRT) have undertaken a project funded by the UK Training Agency to create a multi-media AI and intelligent tutoring based simulation of being in command and control at a large fire incident. Knowledge acquisition for this project is supported by the Fire Brigade and West Midlands Fire Authority in particular. The system, ICCARUS (intelligent command and control-acquisition and review using simulation), is being designed as a multimedia environment in which `realistic' concrete experience is gained of attending, commanding and controlling a major fire incident. The implementation of AI techniques, supported by a Mac IIx, transputers, various optical technology and the use of a sophisticated WIMPS interface allows the participating officer, as in `real life', to become an information nexus; able to request and allocate resources within an audio/textual/visual environment, creating a real-time, event-based qualitative simulation, capable of realistically modelling the behaviour of both the fire and the decision making capabilities of the agents under the officer's control.",,第2页.xls
973,"Filling the gap among coordination, planning, and reaction using a fuzzy cognitive model",2004,"Coordination, planning, and reactivity are important for successful teams of autonomous robots, in dynamic adversarial domains. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy cognitive model to integrate coordination, planning and reactive behaviors in a team of cooperating robots. In our architecture, behavioral modules are used as high-level macroactions that compose structured plans defined by a flexible multi-agent coordination system. The use of an unifying cognitive model provides an effective tool for seamless integration of reactive and deliberative components in the robots, gaining as much as possible from the presence of different skills and competencies in the team. The control model is designed to be tuned and adapted on-line so that the team strategies and the role of robots in the control schemata can be automatically modified to face different opponent teams, and changes in robot capabilities.",,第2页.xls
974,Research progress in teamwork,2012,"Teamwork involves multi-agents collaborating with each other to achieve their common goals. Generally, BDI, DCOP and DEC-POMDP are three main frameworks specially designed for teamwork, which model the interactions and decision-making process from different perspectives, such as intentions, domain knowledge, or rewarded utility. Some novel progresses in the study of these approaches emerged recent years, including enhanced expression capability and improved computational efficiency, which greatly improve the ability to handle practical problems of these approaches. This paper will review these progresses.",,第2页.xls
975,An experimental multi-agent environment for engineering design,1996,"Real-world engineering design projects require the cooperation of multidisciplinary design teams using sophisticated and powerful engineering tools. The individuals or the individual groups of the multidisciplinary design teams work in parallel and independently, often for quite a long time with different tools located on various sites. In order to ensure the coordination of design activities in the different groups or the cooperation among the different tools, it is necessary to develop an efficient design environment. This paper discusses a distributed architecture for integrating such engineering tools in an open design environment, organized as a population of asynchronous cognitive agents. Before introducing the general architecture and the communication protocol, issues concerning the agent architecture and inter-agent communications are discussed. A prototype of such an environment with seven independent agents located in several workstations and microcomputers is then presented and demonstrated on an example of a small mechanical design.",,第2页.xls
976,Deterministic gathering with crash faults,2018,"A team consisting of an unknown number of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, have to meet at the same node and terminate. This problem is known as gathering. We study deterministic gathering algorithms under the assumption that agents are subject to crash faults which can occur at any time. Two fault scenarios are considered. A motion fault immobilizes the agent at a node or inside an edge but leaves intact its memory at the time when the fault occurred. A more severe total fault immobilizes the agent as well, but also erases its entire memory. Of course, we cannot require faulty agents to gather. Thus the gathering problem for fault prone agents calls for all fault-free agents to gather at a single node, and terminate.",,第2页.xls
977,Towards Practical Argumentation-Based Dialogues in Multi-Agent Systems,2015,"Although argumentation has been a prominent topic of research in artificial intelligence and in particular agent communication, there has been little work on practical (but provably sound) argumentation approaches integrated with agent programming languages. In this paper, we develop a formally-grounded mechanism for practical argumentation-based dialogues in an agent platform based on a multi-agent programming language. We formalise a protocol to govern such dialogues, where agents use an argumentation-based reasoning mechanism that has been implemented. We prove that dialogues following our protocol always terminate and that ideal solutions are reached under certain conditions. The protocol is simple but was shown to be useful in a multi-agent system application that supports teams of cooperating humans.",,第2页.xls
978,Minimal belief and negation as failure in multi-agent systems,2003,"We propose an epistemic, nonmonotonic approach to the formalization of knowledge in a multi-agent setting. From the technical viewpoint, a family of nonmonotonic logics, based on Lifschitz's modal logic of minimal belief and negation as failure, is proposed, which allows for formalizing an agent which is able to reason about both its own knowledge and other agents' knowledge and ignorance. We define a reasoning method for such a logic and characterize the computational complexity of the major reasoning tasks in this formalism. From the practical perspective, we argue that our logical framework is well-suited for representing situations in which an agent cooperates in a team, and each agent is able to communicate his knowledge to other agents in the team. In such a case, in many situations the agent needs nonmonotonic abilities, in order to reason about such a situation based on his own knowledge and the other agents' knowledge and ignorance. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our framework in the robotic soccer application domain.",,第2页.xls
979,Human computer intelligent interaction using augmented cognition and emotional intelligence,2007,"Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has mostly developed along two competing methodologies: direct manipulation and intelligent agents. Other possible but complementary methodologies are those of augmented cognition and affective computing and their adaptive combination. Augmented cognition harnesses computation to exploit explicit or implicit knowledge about context, mental state, and motivation for the user, while affective computing provides the means to recognize emotional intelligence and affects human-computer interfaces and interactions people are engaged with. Most HCI studies elicit emotions in relatively simple settings, whereas augmented cognition and affective computing include bodily (physical) embedded within mental (cognitive) and emotional events. Recognition of affective states currently focuses on their physical form (e.g., blinking or face distortions underlying human emotions) rather than implicit behavior and function (their impact on how the user employs the interface or communicates with others). Augmented cognition and affective computing are examined throughout this paper regarding design, implementation, and benefits. Towards that end we have designed an HCH interface that diagnoses and predicts whether the user was fatigued, confused, frustrated, momentarily distracted, or even alive through non-verbal information, namely paralanguage, in a virtual reality (VR) learning environment.",,第2页.xls

The algorithms of the data processing are considered.,,第2页.xls
981,Supporting human communication in network-based systems engineering,2001,"The increased globalization of systems engineering is spawning a range of activities in the support of systems engineering teams who are geographically dispersed. The primary focus is on ways in which these team members can exchange information easily, quickly and accurately. This paper takes the view that a network agent in a systems engineering design team comprises a computer plus a person, the two combining to form the intelligent network agent. A great deal of current activity is being put into the communication of data between computers. Relatively little is being put into supporting the communication between the people who are the most significant component of the intelligent agent. This article investigates the fundamental reasons why the communication is taking place and concludes that its purpose is to transfer from one agent to another sufficient information for the receiving agent to eventually supply a satisfactory deliverable to the sending agent. This implies the transfer, in some form, of a set of requirements. In such a transfer, these requirements will always be interface requirements. The paper goes on to discuss the transfer of computer-based data between dissimilar tools and the issues involved in this transfer. It then compares the domains of expertise of the tool and of the human user, and discusses the mutually supportive operation of these together. From this discussion, the paper proposes a first-cut set of requirements for the data exchange mechanism and its supporting environment.",,第2页.xls
982,Mini robots for soccer,2007,"Robot soccer was introduced with the purpose to develop intelligent cooperative multi-robot (agents) systems (MAS). From the scientific point of view a soccer robot is an intelligent, autonomous agent, carrying out tasks together with other agents in a cooperative, coordinated and communicative way. Robot soccer is a good test bed for the development of MAS for current and future industrial applications. The robots in a team have a common goal to kick the ball in the opponent goal and to avoid goals against the own team. The cooperation and coordination of actions by means of communication are necessary. In this contribution the development of three generations of mini robots for robot soccer, in the FIRA categories Miro- and Narosot, are described. Finally Roby Space as a spin-off of robot soccer is presented.",,第2页.xls
983,CaFe: A Group Process to Rationalize Technologies in Hybrid AAMAS Systems,2014,"Most agent research seeks insights about a single technology, and problems are chosen to allow this focus. In contrast, many real-world applications do not lend themselves to a single technology, but require multiple tools. In an applied AI company, each tool often has its own advocate, whose specialized knowledge may lead her to overestimate her tool's contribution and diminish that of other tools. To form an effective team, the various members must have a shared understanding of how their tools complement one another. This paper describes CaFe (Cases-Features), a group process that we have prototyped for building a consensus mapping between tools and real-world problems. The five AI technologies encompassed in our prototype are cognitive architectures, intelligent user interfaces, classic multi-agent system paradigms, statistics and machine learning, and swarming. Structured group discussion identifies the dimensions of a feature space in which the technologies are distinct. The scheme that emerged from our exercise does not pretend to be an exhaustive characterization of the techniques, but it is a jointly owned map of our technology capabilities that has proven useful in design of new use cases.",,第2页.xls
984,Multi-agent modelling and simulation of cyber-attacks and cyber-defense for homeland security,2007,"The paper considers the approach to investigation of distributed cooperative cyber-defense mechanisms against network attacks, The approach is based on the agent-based simulation of cyber-attacks and cyber-protection mechanisms which combines discrete-event simulation, multi-agent approach and packet-level simulation of network protocols. The various methods of counteraction against cyber-attacks are explored by representing attack and defense components as agent teams using the developed software simulation environment. The teams of defense agents are able to cooperate as the defense system components of different organizations and Internet service providers (ISPs). The paper represents the common framework and implementation peculiarities of the simulation environment as well as the experiments aimed on the investigation of distributed network attacks and defense mechanisms.",,第2页.xls
985,Constructing design methodologies using multiagent systems,2004,An innovative approach has been developed for discovering better design methodologies that is based on simulating the design process using a multiagent system that mimics the behavior of a design team. The system implements a knowledge-based model of design in which highly specialized knowledge from expert sources is applied to synthesize a design. The agents activate the pieces of design knowledge when they become applicable. The use of knowledge by agents is recorded by tracing the steps that the agents have taken during a design project. Many traces are generated by solving a large number of design projects that differ in their requirements. A set of design methodologies is constructed by using inductive learning techniques to generalize the traces generated. These methodologies then can be used to guide human design teams through future design projects.,,第2页.xls
986,Communicative Artificial Intelligence in Multi-agent Gaming,2021,"In many modern game implementations, the intelligent agents are abstracted from their context and from each other. This leads to a disconnected experience that causes information to be lost from each agent once they are defeated. We wish to show the Communicative Artificial Intelligence system for multiagent games. This system provides adaptive AI across generations of agents that the player will encounter. In this scenario the player encounters the first wave of enemy AI near the perimeter of the target zone. The player must choose which weapon or weapons to fight with. If they defeat the enemy agents, these agents pass on their acquired knowledge to the next wave of enemy combatants. This second wave now has developed immunity to the same form of attack that was previously used by the player. As a result, the player must now choose a different attack. This information is passed along to the third wave of enemy agents who now have immunity to all weapons that the player has used thus far (collected from each previous generation of enemy AI). In this manner we hope to create a more strategic approach to the game wherein the player must reason about which weapons to use knowing that they will lose effectiveness as they progress. The goal is for the player to have to use the least powerful weaponry that is sufficient for the task at each level or they will be hopelessly outmatched as the game progresses. This research aims to close a gap in current games that is created by agents not acting as a part of the greater whole. In real-world scenarios the teams would communicate with each other and pass along such vital information. We also hope to draw the conclusion that this system can also inform more complicated systems (such as threat detection, intrusion thwarting, and more capable firewalls). We imagine multi-tiered security systems that pass along the techniques and knowledge about the attack or attacker to each progressively more challenging system thus providing thus providing a much more solid defense. We model such a system in our game as a means of evaluating this type of communicative AI.",,第2页.xls
987,The Analysis of Cooperative Strategies Based on Multi-agent System,2008,"Multi-agent system is a major research domain in Artificial Intelligence. The RoboCup(Robot Soccer Cup) provides an ideal testing platform for MAS. In order to making an appropriate decision in a group of agents, each agent has to take the behavior of the other agents into account. In a dynamic environment, these dependencies may change rapidly as a result of the continuously changing state. First, the characteristics about RoboCup competition and the main research directions in this field will be described in this paper. Second, We will analyze five outstanding simulator teams' cooperative strategies in the RoboCup China Open 2007. The analysis would help us to find the new ideas which are different from the traditional teams and seize the research trend in this field. Finally, the importance of the Multi-agent system in the related field will be discussed in the last part.",,第2页.xls
988,Smells Like Team Spirit: Investigating the Player Experience with Multiple Interlocutors in a VR Game,2020,"Verbal communication is a central component in collaborative multiplayer gaming and creates a feeling of companionship among the players. In single-player games, this aspect is often missing. Advancements in speech recognition now open new potentials for voice-activated single-player experiences. In this work, we integrated voice interaction to a single-player virtual reality (VR) game. To create a sense of team spirit, we enabled players to talk to a multiplicity of agents using natural language. We hypothesize that conversing with only one agent cannot produce the same level of camaraderie. We conducted a preliminary qualitative user study (N=10) to explore how players experience talking with the in-game characters in the single-agent and the multi-agent condition. Early results suggest that our participants prefer interacting with the group of interlocutors. They perceived the multi-agent condition as more entertaining and liked the feeling of being part of a team.",,第2页.xls
989,Elevator group control using multiple reinforcement learning agents,1998,"Recent algorithmic and theoretical advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have attracted widespread interest. RL algorithms have appeared that approximate dynamic programming on an incremental basis. They can be trained on the basis of real or simulated experiences, focusing their computation on areas of state space that are actually visited during control, making them computationally tractable on very large problems. If each member of a team of agents employs one of these algorithms, a new collective learning algorithm emerges for the team as a whole. We demonstrate that such collective RL algorithms can be powerful heuristic methods for addressing large-scale control problems. Elevator group control serves as our testbed. It is a difficult domain posing a combination of challenges not seen in most multi-agent learning research to date. We use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reward signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of multi-agent RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility.",,第2页.xls
990,Dynamic Input Consensus using Integrators,2011,"The consensus or agreement problem enables a team of agents to agree on certain information variables using a low-bandwidth, dynamic, and sparsely-connected graph. However, most prior work on agreement protocols has focused on converging to a single, static variable. In this paper, we propose a consensus filter that accepts dynamically changing inputs at each agent. We analyze several properties of this consensus filter, proving the outputs of the filter converge to a low-pass filtered version of the average of the inputs. Disagreement portions of the inputs can be significantly attenuated through judicious selection of filter parameters.",,第2页.xls
991,Team-based multi-agent system for early detection of adverse drug reactions in postmarketing surveillance,2005,"Discovering unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance as early as possible is highly desirable. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided Web-based forms for spontaneous reporting of possible ADRs. Nevertheless, the process of analyzing and interpreting the reports, collecting additional relevant information, and drawing reliable conclusions requires collaboration between experts with different and complimentary skills (e.g., epidemiologists, biostatisticians, pharmacists and physicians). Multi-agent systems have been shown to be a promising approach for tackling distributed problem solving, especially when data sources and knowledge are distributed, and coordination and collaboration are required. Hence, we propose a team-based multi-agent framework for early detection of ADRs. In this framework, intelligent agents assist a team of experts based on a human decision making model called Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD). Fuzzy logic is used to determine the degree of similarity for retrieving experience in the RPD model. We describe our preliminary system design and illustrate its potential benefits for assisting FDA expert teams in early detection of previously unknown ADRs.",,第2页.xls

On the other hand, in response to the challenges of globalization and formation of the international teams whose members are distributed on the world; software project management (SPM) environment has been changed since two decade ago.

993,Task Complexity and Performance in Individuals and Groups Without Communication,2022,"While groups where members communicate with each other may perform better than groups without communication, there are multiple scenarios where communication between group members is not possible. Our work analyses the impact of task complexity on individuals and groups of different sizes while solving a goal-seeking navigation task without communication. Our major goal is to determine the effect of task complexity on performance and whether agents in a group are able to coordinate to perform the task effectively despite the lack of communication. We developed a cognitive model of each individual agent that performs the task. We compare the performance of this agent with individual human performance, who worked on the same task. We observe that the cognitive agent is able to replicate the general behavioral trends observed in humans. Using this cognitive model, we generate groups of different sizes where individual agents work in the same goal-seeking task independently and without communication. First, we observe that increasing task complexity by design does not necessarily lead to worse performance in individuals and groups. We also observe that larger groups perform better than smaller groups and individuals alone. However, individual agents within a group perform worse than an agent working on the task alone. This effect is not the result of agents within a group covering less ground in the task compared to individuals alone. Rather, it is an effect resulting from the overlap of the agents within a group. Importantly, agents learn to reduce their overlap and improve their performance without explicit communication. These results can inform the design of AI agents in human-machine teams.",,第2页.xls
994,Automated Post-Breach Penetration Testing through Reinforcement Learning,2020,"Predicting cyber attacks to networks is ever present challenges in the security domain. Rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made this even more challenging as machine learning algorithms are now used to attack such systems while defense systems continue to protect them with traditional approaches. Penetration testing (pentest) has long been one way to prevent security breaches by mimicking black hat hackers to expose possible exploits and vulnerabilities. Using trained machine learning agents to automate this process is an important research area that still needs to be explored. The objective of this paper is to apply machine learning in the post-exploitation phase of penetration testing to assess the vulnerability of the system and hence, contribute to the automation process of penetration testing. We train the agent using reinforcement learning by providing an appropriate environment to explore a compromised network and find sensitive files. By utilizing several different network environments during training, we hope to generalize our agent as much as possible, allowing for more widespread application. Extended research may include training our agent for further lateral exploration and exploitation in the system.",,第2页.xls
995,Model sharing among agents in a concurrent product development team,2000,"We describe a project involving the use of software agents for concurrent engineering of electromechanical products. The agents are a mix of autonomous programs and software interfaces for human specialists in an engineering team. Our goal is to accelerate the design process by reducing delays associated with the exchange of design information, including models, constraints, objectives, and dependencies associated with each agent. Part of this effort involves methods for representing and exchanging design information in a human/machine-readable form. In this paper we focus on the sharing of information in models, such as the lumped-parameter models of electromechanical systems that engineers often use in the early stages of design. We first review the design information-sharing problem and examine the different levels of abstraction and detail at which such information is represented and shared. We then introduce a representation language and information-sharing infrastructure that we have employed for an agent-based concurrent engineering system. We illustrate some of the issues involved in our approach with a short scenario involving the redesign of an optical pick-up head for DVD (digital versatile disc) players. We then discuss our plans for extending the system to allow more general exchanges of engineering models among agents.",,第2页.xls

We consider a difficult control problem involving a team of cooperating mobile agents for which an algorithm suitable for generating trajectories online and in real-time, was developed earlier. We show that the results developed in here validate simulation results of this algorithm which was based on a similar but only an approximate feasibility analysis. We give a rigorous treatment of the example problem which includes results on its accessibility, feasibility, local asymptotic straightening of trajectories and a limited result on system controllability.",,第2页.xls
997,Towards an understanding of the value of cooperation in uncertain world,2011,"Recent work has provided tantalizing hints that small amounts of cooperation may actually hurt a group's performance rather than help it. In this paper, we take a systematic look at the value of cooperation. Using a simple cooperative task where agents can act effectively individually but where high levels of cooperation will intuitively lead to better behavior, we investigated when and how cooperation helped overall performance. We systematically varied properties of the environment, e.g., the amount of uncertainty, and how much of what sort of cooperation the agents would perform, e.g., information sharing, resource allocation etc. Our experimental results show that, even if communication were free, and while typically coordination helps the team, under some circumstances, the team may be better off not coordinating at all than coordinating a little bit. We show that the level of uncertainty the agents face and their initial understandings of the environment determine whether a small amount of coordination is useful.",,第2页.xls
998,Work in progress - agent based social simulations by cross-cultural student teams,2008,"Intelligent software agents are particularly well suited for the simulation of complex collective behavior and interaction. Agent Based Social Simulation (ABSS) is currently being used within a multi-year, multi-university research project to develop a flexible benchmarking platform on which to test customer-facing algorithms. Along the process, the educational potential of the approach has become apparent. Given the user friendliness of the existing open source development environments, carefully designed assignments for the development of specific chunks can be carried out in a timeframe compatible with normal graduate coursework. However, operating within the framework of a project encompassing institutions in such different cultural environments as India and Europe enables taking advantage of the broader perspective it provides to design collective, interacting assignments, in which each students ABSS interacts with the others in a meaningful way. This project is modeled upon prior rewarding experiences by the research team in cross-cultural student teams in other environments. It involves combining students attending courses in each partner university in integrated assignments, interacting over the Internet. This cross-cultural educational experience could be fine-tuned to focus on various potential development opportunities, ranging from the technological to the capability development. The fact that what they are simulating are social systems, which students from different cultures are likely to model very differently, will further raise their awareness of diversity and develop their skills to harness its positive potential.",,第2页.xls
999,Trust-Based Interactions in Teams of Mobile Agents,2016,"This paper introduces a trust model that couples the change in performance in a team of agents to how the agents perceive (or trust) each other. This combination of social dynamics and physical update laws not only changes the performance of the system, but it has the potential to make it deteriorate in a dramatic fashion. In fact, in the two-agent case, it is shown that the system exhibits finite escape time through an invariance result that carries over also to larger systems and more elaborate trust models. The invariance result states that an increase in performance must be accompanied by an increase in the total trust in the network (and vice versa for deteriorating performance). Finally, the connection is made between the proposed model and the belief and group polarization phenomena encountered in group processes driven by social interaction dynamics.",,第2页.xls
0,Do birds of a feather work better together? The impact of a match in personality between humans and virtual agents on a shared mental model during collaboration,2016,"A shared mental model (SMM) between human team members has been found to improve teamwork performance. In the literature, multimodal communication of shared knowledge has been reported to influence the development of a SMM. In virtual worlds, within a team comprised of a human and an intelligent virtual agent (IVA), the influence of IVA personality on collaboration and development of a SMM has not been previously studied. In this study, we explore the impact of an IVAs personality traits on the development of taskwork and teamwork SMMs with human teammates. Moreover, this study investigated the influence of a match in personality traits between IVAs and humans on the development of a SMM. In this study, five versions of an IVA performing the same scenario were developed. Besides a neutral personality, four combinations of two personality traits, i.e., extraversion and agreeableness were created. Participants were divided into five groups each assigned one version of the IVA. The results showed that agreeable IVAs positively impacted on the development of taskwork and teamwork SMMs; whereas extraversion did not influence development of the SMM. Moreover, when the human and IVA had matching agreeableness personality traits, SMM development and performance improved.",,第3页.xls
1,CUI@CHI 2024: Building Trust in CUIs - From Design to Deployment,2024,"Conversational user interfaces (CUIs) have become an everyday technology for people the world over, as well as a booming area of research. Advances in voice synthesis and the emergence of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs), notably ChatGPT, have pushed CUIs to the forefront of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice. Now that these technologies enable an elemental level of usability and user experience (UX), we must turn our attention to higher-order human factors: trust and reliance. In this workshop, we aim to bring together a multidisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners invested in the next phase of CUI design. Through keynotes, presentations, and breakout sessions, we will share our knowledge, identify cutting-edge resources, and fortify an international network of CUI scholars. In particular, we will engage with the complexity of trust and reliance as attitudes and behaviours that emerge when people interact with conversational agents.",,第3页.xls
2,A modelling language for cooperative plans in highly dynamic domains,2011,"Cooperative behaviour is one of the challenges most pronounced in the RoboCup Middle Size League. Especially the dynamic nature of the domain, which calls for swift adaptation by each robot and the team as a whole, is a distinctive property of the league. The ability to establish highly responsive teamwork while facing unreliable communication and sensory noise is a key to successful soccer teams. Moreover, modelling such responsive, cooperative behaviour is difficult. In this work, we specify a novel model for cooperative behaviour geared towards highly dynamic domains, focussing on the language syntax and semantics. In our approach, agents estimate each other's decision and correct these estimations once they receive contradictory information. We provide a comprehensive approach for agent teamwork featuring intuitive modelling capabilities for multi-agent activities, abstractions over activities and agents, and a clear operational semantics. Moreover, we briefly present a graphical modeling tool for cooperative strategies, which is based directly on the theory laid out, together with a practical framework for executing said strategies. We show experimentally the responsiveness and coherence of the resulting team play. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls
3,RoboCup Rescue as multiagent task allocation among teams: experiments with task interdependencies,2010,"This paper addresses distributed task allocation among teams of agents in a RoboCup Rescue scenario. We are primarily concerned with testing different mechanisms that formalize issues underlying implicit coordination among teams of agents. These mechanisms are developed, implemented, and evaluated using two algorithms: Swarm-GAP and LA-DCOP. The latter bases task allocation on a comparison between an agent's capability to perform a task and the capability demanded by this task. Swarm-GAP is a probabilistic approach in which an agent selects a task using a model inspired by task allocation among social insects. Both algorithms were also compared to another one that allocates tasks in a greedy way. Departing from previous works that tackle task allocation in the rescue scenario only among fire brigades, here we consider the various actors in the RoboCup Rescue, a step forward in the direction of realizing the concept of extreme teams. Tasks are allocated to teams of agents without explicit negotiation and using only local information. Our results show that the performance of Swarm-GAP and LA-DCOP are similar and that they outperform a greedy strategy. Also, it is possible to see that using more sophisticated mechanisms for task selection does pay off in terms of score.",,第3页.xls

To solve the test table design task of the complex system-level objectives it is divided into subsystems. All test table subsystems are considered as separate set of design variables that must be addressed by virtual design teams called agents. Agents search design solutions and cooperate to meet design task of the complete test table system.",,第3页.xls
5,Team conflict measurement and resolution,2003,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the collaboration and conflict among working teams and groups, and to assess their impact on organizational functionalities. The teams can be located in the same place, different places, or virtual places that transcend distance and time zones. Teams collaborate through distributed systems that require high performance. This paper presents the measurement of conflict among teams or groups, and introduces weights to groups or teams for conflict resolution. Finally, vile introduce a tool to measure the group or team conflict, assign choices and weights to resolve the conflict, and graphically present the results.",,第3页.xls
6,"I'm OK, you're OK, we're OK: experiments in distributed and centralized socially attentive monitoring",1999,"Execution monitoring is a critical challenge for agents in dynamic, complex, multi-agent domains. Existing approaches utilize goal-attentive models which monitor achievement of task goals. However, they lack knowledge of the intended relationships which should hold among the agents, and so fail to address key opportunities and difficulties in multi-agent settings. We explore SAM, a novel complementary framework for social monitoring that utilizes knowledge of social relationships among agents in monitoring them. We compare the performance of SAM when monitoring is done by a single agent in a centralized fashion, versus team monitoring in a distributed fashion. We experiment with several SAM instantiations, algorithms that are sound and incomplete, unsound and complete, and both sound and complete. While a more complex algorithm appears useful in the centralized case (but is unsound), the surprising result is that a much simpler algorithm in the distributed case is both sound and complete. We present a set of techniques for practical, efficient implementations with rigorously proven performance guarantees, and systematic empirical validation.",,第3页.xls
7,Decision As Choice of Potential Intentions,2012,"Multi- agent systems research has been drawing innovative insights from other disciplines such as philosophy and cognitive science. While cognitive studies have shown that over 95% of human decisions conform to the recognitionprimed decision making (RPD) model, there still lacks a formal mentalistic description of RPD, which has raised an interoperability issue when a team is formed from agents with different RPD implementations. The objective of this study is to establish a formal connection between agent mental attitudes and the meta-cognition concepts as used in RPD. We adopt the intentional attitudes as introduced in the SharedPlans theory to model the RPD process and its cognitive activities from teamwork perspective. Such a formal analysis helps to resolve the ambiguities in the original description of the RPD model; it also demonstrates a viable approach where connectionists could formally study meta-cognition concepts and team cognition concepts by agent-based modeling.",,第3页.xls
8,Machine-Assisted Error Discovery in Conversational AI Systems,2024,"Troubles in speaking, hearing, and understanding occur routinely in any kind of conversational setting. The natural flow of conversation includes methods for repairing such troubles by repeating or paraphrasing all or parts of prior turns. In the case of conversational AI systems, these troubles occur due to failure of different components of the system such as the speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. Such errors may occur infrequently, but still often enough to have a significant impact on key performance indicators (KPIs). Identifying the root cause of these errors is a complex task that requires a team to meticulously examine and interpret the interaction between the voice agent and customers. In this work, we present an interactive system, DTTool, that surfaces system-generated annotations that hint at anomalous events that lead to candidate errors that impact KPIs and demonstrate how the team could discover unknown errors using DTTool.",,第3页.xls
9,The RAPPID project: symbiosis between industrial requirements and MAS research,1999,"The RAPPID project (Responsible Agents for Product-Process Integrated Design) is developing agent-based software tools and methods that use market place dynamics among members of a distributed design team to coordinate set-based design of discrete manufactured products. This report describes the interplay of industrial requirements and multi-agent system (MAS) research in the design, implementation, and testing of RAPPID. Like any industrial project, RAPPID begins with the requirements of the problem domain, and draws selectively from research results to meet those requirements. However, the flow of information is not unidirectional. In the process of addressing its requirements, RAPPID developed some new concepts that hold promise for broader application to distributed constraint optimization. RAPPID is work in process, not a completed product, and this report includes an assessment of what needs to be done in addition to what has been accomplished.",,第3页.xls
10,Rise of the machines: Delegating decisions to autonomous AI,2022,"Delegation is an important part of organizational success and can be used to overcome personal shortcomings and draw upon the expertise and abilities of others. However, delegation comes with risks and uncertainties, as it entails a transfer of power and loss of control. Indeed, research has documented that people tend to under-delegate to other humans, often leading to poor decisions and ultimately negative economic consequences. Today, however, people are faced with a new delegation choice: Artificial Intelligence (AI). Fueled by Big Data, AI is rapidly becoming more intelligent and frequently outperforming human forecasters and decision-makers. Given this evolution of computational autonomy, researchers need to revisit the hows and whys of decision delegation and clarify not only whether people are willing to cede control to AI agents but also whether AI can reduce the under-delegation that is especially pronounced when people are faced with decisions that spur a high desire for control. By linking research on decision delegation, social risk, and control premium to the emerging field of trust in AI, we propose and find that people prefer to delegate decisions to AI as compared to human agents, especially when decisions entail losses (Studies 1-3). Results further illuminate the underlying psychological process involved (Study 1 and 2) and show that process transparency increases delegation to humans but not to AI (Study 3). These findings have important implications for research on trust in AI and the applicability of autonomous AI systems for managers and decision makers. All rights reserved Elsevier.",,第3页.xls
11,A Study on Multi-Agent Behavior in a Soccer Game Domain,2008,"There have been many games developing simulation of soccer games. Many of these games have been designed with highly realistic features to attract more users. Many have also incorporated better artificial intelligent (AI) similar to that in a real soccer game. One of the challenging issues in a soccer game is the cooperation, coordination and negotiation among distributed agents in a multi-agent system. This paper focuses on the incorporation of multi-agent technique in a soccer game domain. The better the cooperation of a multi-agent team, the more intelligent the game will be. Thus, past studies were done on the robotic soccer game because of the better multi-agent system implementation. From this study, a better approach and technique of multi-agent behavior could be select to improve the author's 2D online soccer game.",,第3页.xls
12,Flocking in teams of nonholonomic agents,2004,The motion of a group of nonholonomic mobile agents is synchronized using local control laws. This synchronization strategy is inspired by the early flocking model proposed by Reynolds and following work. The control laws presented ensure that all agent headings and speeds converge asymptotically to the same value and collisions between the agents are avoided. The stability of this type of motion is closely related to the connectivity properties of the underlying interconnection graph. Proof techniques are based on LaSalle's invariant principle and algebraic graph theory and the results are verified in numerical simulations.,,第3页.xls
13,Learning sequences of actions in collectives of autonomous agents,2002,"We focus on the problem of designing a collective of autonomous agents that individually learn sequences of actions such that the resultant sequence of joint actions achieves a predetermined global objective. Directly applying reinforcement learning (RL) concepts to multi-agent systems often proves problematic, as agents may work at cross-purposes, or have difficulty in evaluating their contribution to achievement of the global objective, or both. Accordingly, the crucial design step in designing multi-agent systems focuses on how to set the rewards for the RL algorithm of each agent so that as the agents attempt to maximize those rewards, the system reaches a globally desirable solution. In this work we consider a version of this problem involving multiple autonomous agents in a grid world. We use concepts from collective intelligence (Tumer and Wolpert, 2000) to design rewards for the agents that are aligned with the global reward, and are learnable in that agents can readily see how their behavior affects their reward. We show that reinforcement learning agents using those rewards outperform both natural extensions of single agent algorithms and global reinforcement learning solutions based on team games.",,第3页.xls
14,Team Modeling with Deep Behavioral Cloning for the RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation League,2023,"Soccer is still considered an open problem by the AI community due to its complex stochastic real-time multiagent nature. The RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D League has been used as a testbed for new ideas and techniques for many subjects, including team modeling. However, even though team modeling has been an indispensable part of the best league participants to date, in practice it typically consists of ad-hoc heuristics encoded as rules. This requires time-consuming manual work, does not scale to multiple teams, and does not work well at unaccounted scenarios. This paper presents a data-driven method for modeling teams by training Deep Neural Networks with large amounts of data with an Imitation Learning formulation. We demonstrate the approach by training a deep model of the Japanese team Helios using 57,578,668 state-action pairs of players. The resulting model achieved 84.5% accuracy on action selection and a small error on regression of the action parameters. The network is shown to be an effective movement predictor of Helios field players and have negligible degradation when Helios is evaluated against adversaries not seen at training time.",,第3页.xls
15,A tutor agent for supporting distributed knowledge modelling in interactive product design,2008,"Currently, the process of problem analysis in product design involves multiple partners in a distributed environment. A tutoring approach to support knowledge modelling will be presented in this article, focusing on variables as a key component of knowledge. A set of Tutor Agents intends to aid distributed partners to coherently elicitate their know-how in order to use to analyse design problems. A granular Knowledge Base is proposed to standardise distributed knowledge, providing product life-cycle (PLC) constraints (based on product knowledge) to construct optimisation models. Furthermore, a case will be presented in order to clarify the approach. The results will enable design teams to integrate constraints from PLC knowledge in order to optimise the evolution of design concepts.",,第3页.xls
16,Battlefield agent collaboration,2001,"Small air and ground physical agents (robots) will be ubiquitous on the battlefield of the 21(st) century, principally to lower the exposure to harm of our ground forces in urban and open terrain scenarios. Teams of small collaborating physical agents conducting tasks such as Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA), intelligence, chemical and biological agent detection, logistics, decoy, sentry; and communications relay will have advanced sensors. communications, and mobility characteristics. It is anticipated that there will be many levels of individual and team collaboration between the soldier and robot, robot to robot, and robot to mother ship. This paper presents applications and infrastructure components that illustrate each of these levels. As an example, consider the application where a team of twenty small robots must rapidly explore and define a building complex. Local interactions and decisions require peer to peer collaboration. Global direction and information fusion warrant a central team control provided by a mother ship. The mother ship must effectively deliver/retrieve, service. and control these robots as well as fuse the information gathered by these highly mobile robot teams. Any level of collaboration requires robust communications, specifically a mobile ad hoc network. The application of fixed ground sensors and mobile robots is also included in this paperThis paper discusses on going research at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory that supports the development of multi-robot collaboration. This research includes battlefield visualization. intelligent software agents, adaptive communications, sensor and information fusion, and multi-modal human computer interaction.",,第3页.xls
17,Contiguous search in the hypercube for capturing an intruder,2005,"In this paper we consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a network. There is a team of collaborative software agents that are deployed to capture a hostile intruder (e.g., a virus). These agents asynchronously move along the network links and the intruder has the capability of escaping arbitrarily fast. We propose two different strategies for the solution of the problem in a widely studied topology: the hypercube network. In the first strategy one of the agents acts as a coordinator making the other agents move in a precise way; this strategy requires O(nlogn) moves, a team of agents and runs in O(nlogn) time steps. The second strategy is devised for a model where the agents are allowed to see the state of their neighbours. In this case, the computation is local, i.e., there is no need of a coordinator and agents can move autonomously. In this setting the solution requires n/2 agents, but is much faster (logn time steps), and requires the same number of moves (O(nlogn)).",,第3页.xls
18,WWG: a wide-area infrastructure to support groups,2001,"Group learning on the Internet scale is becoming more frequent in university courses. This complex process requires support by distributed computing learning support infrastructures. This paper describes the design of WWG (World-Wide Groups), a distributed and decentralized infrastructure with the aim of supporting distributed group learning and team work, centered on the distribution of events, so that every participant can be notified and thus be aware of the actions, changes, and progress of the groups to which they belong. The design issues, requirements and the resulting architecture are presented. WWG is based on a multi-component architecture where metainformation agents are responsible for helping the events to reach members of the group; repository agents are responsible for the storage of group information; and user agents are responsible for the representation of users (sources and sinks of events). In this paper we tried to show that by applying event transformation policies, WWG is scalable at the group level.",,第3页.xls
19,Multi-agent reinforcement learning based on local communication,2019,"Aiming at the locality and uncertainty of observations in large-scale multi-agent application scenarios, the model of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (DEC-POMDP) is considered, and a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on local communication is proposed. For a distributed learning environment, the elements of reinforcement learning are difficult to describe effectively in local observation situation, and the learning behaviour of each individual agent is influenced by its teammates. The local communication with consensus protocol is utilized to agree on the global observing environment, and thus that a part of strategies generated by repeating observations are eliminated, and the agent team gradually reach uniform opinion on the state of the event or object to be observed, they can thus approach a unique belief space regardless of whether each individual agent can perform a complete or partial observation. The simulation results show that the learning strategy space is reduced, and the learning speed is improved.",,第3页.xls

21,Curriculum Learning Based Multi-Agent Path Finding for Complex Environments,2023,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a promising tool to solve the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) task, which aims to find conflict-free paths for multiple agents, one for each agent, from a start position to a goal position. It uses global information to learn a mechanism for cooperation among agents by maximising the cumulative team rewards, which are often very sparse. However, the sparsity of rewards implies that agents have to blindly explore all possible paths, which makes MARL methods difficult to converge in complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Curriculum based Path-finding Learning (CPL) under the framework of curriculum learning, which allows agents to start with simple skills and to learn cooperative strategies stage-by-stage for more efficient training. Specifically, CPL divides the training process into three stages and speeds up the learning by changing the difficulty of the tasks from easy to hard. Experiments on random obstacle grid worlds show that our proposed method performs significantly better in terms of success rate and makespan than state-of-the-art learning-based methods.",,第3页.xls

23,Social communicative effects of a virtual program guide,2005,"Embodied interface agents are considered to be a promising interface metaphor of the future since they are widely expected to facilitate HCI and trigger natural communication. Although first evaluations indicate that virtual characters have various strong effects, it is still unknown if and how embodied conversational agents affect the way in which users communicate with the technological system. An experimental study was conducted to analyze if users interact differently when confronted with different kinds of interfaces (GUI, speech output, embodied interface agent) of a TV-VCR-System. 65 participants were asked to solve different tasks choosing either natural speech or remote control as input devices. Results show that a system A significantly more often addressed by natural speech when an embodied interface agent is visible. Additional qualitative analyses of the semantic content of all 943 speech acts indicate that users seem to have a more human-like attitude and behavior towards the system when it is represented by an anthropomorphic agent.",,第3页.xls
24,A multi-agent system for cooperative document indexing and querying in distributed networked environments,1999,"In an age of rapidly changing work environments it is becoming increasingly the norm for project and research teams to be composed of individuals who are geographically distributed but connected for work purposes by high speed communication networks. In such environments there is a real need for automated support systems that facilitate the easy and effective sharing of work related documents and files among workgroup members. This paper presents a cooperative agent based solution known as MAIQS, which is an acronym for Multi-Agent Indexing and Query System. A MAIQS agent is installed on each team member's workstation where it takes on responsibilities for: building and dynamically maintaining indexes to specified user data; locating its counterpart agents on other machines; and supporting parallel queries across the community of agents. Such queries may utilise directly connected synchronous exchanges or (where firewalls necessitate) asynchronous email based exchanges. MAIQS, a 100% Java application, is presented here from a network computing perspective and its current implementation and future development examined.",,第3页.xls

Since the Nash equilibrium of multiplayer games is difficult to solve even within only two players, multiplayer poker has always been an challenging problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence. From the perspective of game theory, the pursuing of diverse polices is necessary in non-stationary environment, which is deeply rooted in the non-transitive structure of game. In this paper, in order to provide a tractable solution for multiplayer poker, we first uses the Team-maxmin equilibrium to re-define the solution concept of multiplayer poker without communication in the game playing process. Secondly, we utilize the diverse curriculum learning with neuroevolution (DCLN) method for offline opponent exploitation, try to improve the competitiveness and diversity of the multiplayer poker agent gaming with various opponent. Experimental results show that this kind of agent has the ability to evolve and can defeat different play-styles opponent.",,第3页.xls
26,Token-Based Coordination in Multiagent Organization,2015,"This paper describes a coordination approach for multiagent organization that is constructed as a hierarchical composite multiagent architecture. There are many heterogeneous composite agents each of which is composed of several individual agents and two types of coordinator agents: Intelligent Coordinator agent (ICo) and Assistant Coordinator agent (ACo). When any agent has a task, it creates a token and sends to ICo through ACo. Then, ICo chooses appropriate composite agent and sends the token to it. Each composite agent has one ACo that is responsible for selecting appropriate individual agent, and communicating with ICo. Coordinator agents use token based coordination to route the tokens to correct receiver agents efficiently and directly. We developed coordinator algorithms for passing the tokens. This approach can reduce extra routing and provide efficient and effective coordination among large agent teams with very little communication.",,第3页.xls
27,Computational models of emotions for autonomous agents: major challenges,2015,"A great number of computational models of emotions (CMEs) have been developed to be included in, or as part of, cognitive agent architectures. These computational models have been designed to provide autonomous agents with appropriate mechanisms for the processing of emotional stimuli, the elicitation of synthetic emotions, and the generation of emotional responses. The research on CMEs has allowed for improvements in several application domains and contributed to progress in areas such as human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, despite the wide variety of CMEs proposed in the literature and their success in multiple areas, the complexity and quality of current and future human-centered applications require the development of more flexible and robust CMEs. In this sense, CMEs have yet to face a series of challenges in order to meet such types of requirements. In this paper, we explore key aspects of the development and applications of CMEs for autonomous agents, discuss four major challenges facing their development process, and present a novel approach to deal with these challenges.",,第3页.xls

29,Effective team onboarding in Agile software development: techniques and goals [arXiv],2019,"Context: It is not uncommon for a new team member to join an existing Agile software development team, even after development has started. This new team member faces a number of challenges before they are integrated into the team and can contribute productively to team progress. Ideally, each newcomer should be supported in this transition through an effective team onboarding program, although prior evidence suggests that this is challenging for many organisations. Objective: We seek to understand how Agile teams address the challenge of team onboarding in order to inform future onboarding design. Method: We conducted an interview survey of eleven participants from eight organisations to investigate what onboarding activities are common across Agile software development teams. We also identify common goals of onboarding from a synthesis of literature. A repertory grid instrument is used to map the contributions of onboarding techniques to onboarding goals. Results: Our study reveals that a broad range of team onboarding techniques, both formal and informal, are used in practice. It also shows that particular techniques that have high contributions to a given goal or set of goals. Conclusions: In presenting a set of onboarding goals to consider and an evidence-based mechanism for selecting techniques to achieve the desired goals it is expected that this study will contribute to better-informed onboarding design and planning. An increase in practitioner awareness of the options for supporting new team members is also an expected outcome.",,第3页.xls

33,Evaluating individual player strategies in a collaborative incomplete-information agent-based game playing environment,2006,"In Spanish-speaking countries, the game of dominoes is usually played by four people divided into two teams, with teammates sitting opposite each other. The players cannot communicate with each other or receive information from onlookers while a game is being played. Each player only knows for sure which tiles he/she has available in order to make a play, but must make inferences about the plays that the other participants can make in order to try to ensure that his/her team wins the game. The game is governed by a set of standardized rules, and successful play involves the use of highly-developed mathematical, reasoning and decision-making skills. In this paper we describe a computer system designed to simulate the game of dominoes by using four independent game-playing agents split into teams of two.

35,Towards an intelligence based conceptual framework for e-maintenance,2013,"Most of the work has emphasized upon of the underlying Information and Communication Technologies ICT infrastructure since the concept of e-maintenance was introduced. The main issue of the carried out works related to emaintenance is integrating different systems relative to maintenance into one information system. This paper aims to reconsider the predominance of ICT within e-maintenance projects and literature and highlights the importance of intelligence as a fundamental dimension of e-maintenance that is to be considered in a holistic predefined manner rather than isolated efforts within ICT driven approaches. This work also proposes a model of e-maintenance system as a contribution towards an intelligence based e-maintenance conceptual framework based on CogAff architecture for intelligent agents. Furthermore, a case study is defined sustaining the use of the proposed model in relation to the classification of existing emaintenance platforms which underlines two issues of existing emaintenance solutions regarding to real integration of the system into human teams and more integration at the management strategic level.",,第3页.xls
36,"Trust, Ethics, Consciousness, and Artificial Intelligence",2022,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to proliferate across manufacturing, economic, medical, aerospace, transportation, and social realms, ethical guidelines must be established to not only protect humans at the mercy of automated decision making, but also autonomous agents themselves, should they become conscious. While AI appears smart to the public, and may outperform humans on specific tasks, the truth is that today's AI lacks insight beyond the restricted scope of problems to which it has been tasked. Without context, AI is effectively incapable of comprehending the true nature of what it does and is oblivious to the reverberations it may cause in the real world should it err in prediction. Despite this, future AI may be equipped with enough sensors and neural processing capacity to acquire a dynamic cognizance more akin to humans. If this materializes, will autonomous agents question their own position in this world? One must entertain the possibility that this is not merely hypothetical but may, in fact, be imminent if humanity succeeds in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI).If autonomous agents with the capacity for artificial consciousness are delegated grueling tasks, outcomes could mirror the plight of exploited workers, result in retaliation, failure to comply, alternative objectives, or breakdown of human-autonomy teams. It will be critical to decide how and in which contexts various agents should be utilized. Additionally, delineating the meaning of trust and ethical consideration between humans and machines is problematic because descriptions of trust and ethics have only been detailed in human terms. This means autonomous agents will be subject to anthropomorphism, but robots are not humans, and their experience of trust and ethics might be markedly distinct from humans. Ideally speaking, to fully entrust a machine with human-centered tasks, one must believe that such an entity is reliable, competent, has the appropriate priorities in decision-making, and can comprehend the consequences of actions taken. Such qualities may depend on conscious awareness-but without first deciphering what consciousness is in the first place, humans may fail to accurately identify consciousness in machines.This work explores the foundations of consciousness from the perspective of evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers, and strives to position degrees of consciousness in a trust and ethical consideration framework to guide AI usage and research. To mitigate foreseeable risks in autonomy, the authors seek to spark dialogue and preventative action, so proper legal and operational requirements can be established prior to any agent acquiring even an inkling of consciousness. If implemented correctly, such measures may reduce the likelihood of unintentional damage and help to secure a future of continued collaboration and shared success between humans and machines.",,第3页.xls
37,Aspect oriented design for team learning management system,2015,"A multi agent system (MAS) is a complex system composed of heterogeneous agents each has a number of concern that are cross-cutting such as mobility, learning, collaboration, adaptation, interaction and autonomy. MASs are currently designed to be superimposed on object oriented designs so that it can be possible to separate these concerns in order to improve reusability and maintainability. Hence, aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) exists to cope with complexity of software development for the purpose of separating functionality that are not handled by other software development. Following this line of thought, AOSD is considered for developing aspects for team learning management system; that allows recognizing learners learning preferences and associated learning style in the learning environment. This paper presents an approach to move from object oriented eTutor to agent oriented eTutor through aspect oriented software development. This transition is being deployed through the implementation level. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第3页.xls

In this paper, we propose employing chatbots in the domain of software development with a focus on supporting analyses and measurements of teams' project data. The software project artifacts produced by agile teams during regular development activities, e.g. commits in a version control system, represent detailed information on how a team works and collaborates. Analyses of this data are especially relevant for agile retrospective meetings, where adaptations and improvements to the executed development process are discussed.

However, challenges in model training, maintenance, and frequent false positives impact its acceptance and reliability. Explainable AI (XAI) attempts to mitigate these issues, allowing cybersecurity teams to assess AI-generated alerts with confidence, but has seen limited acceptance from incident responders. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution through discerning patterns in extensive information and adapting to different functional requirements. We present HuntGPT, a specialized intrusion detection dashboard applying a Random Forest classifier using the KDD99 dataset, integrating XAI frameworks like SHAP and Lime for user-friendly and intuitive model interaction, and combined with a GPT-3.5 Turbo, it delivers threats in an understandable format. The paper delves into the system's architecture, components, and technical accuracy, assessed through Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) Practice Exams, evaluating response quality across six metrics. The results demonstrate that conversational agents, supported by LLM and integrated with XAI, provide robust, explainable, and actionable AI solutions in intrusion detection, enhancing user understanding and interactive experience.",,第3页.xls

Distributed boundary coverage is an instance of the multi-robot task-allocation problem and has applications in inspection, cleaning, and painting among others. The proposed algorithm is robust to sensor and actuator noise, failure of individual robots, and communication loss. We use a market-based algorithm with known lower bounds on the performance to allocate the environmental objects of interest among the team of robots. The coverage time for systems subject to sensor and actuator noise is significantly shortended by on-line task re-allocation. The complexity and convergence properties of the algorithm are formally analyzed. The system performance is systematically analyzed at two different microscopic modeling levels, using agent-based, discrete-event and module-based, realistic simulators. Finally, results obtained in simulation are validated using a team of Alice miniature robots involved in a distributed inspection case study.",,第3页.xls
42,From steering to coaching: a new challenge to executive support systems,1999,"Self-directed teams have become the core work unit in high-performing organisations. In such settings (e.g. office, hospital and factory settings etc.) team members assume responsibilities that were once considered managerial duties (e.g. scheduling, ordering materials, evaluating performances, budgeting etc). Supporting a group of workers as a self-directed team does not automatically create self-management capability. Developing such capabilities is critical to business and socially successful teams. The need for a better integration and better ways to handle not only the various transitions inherent in work practice, but also its emergent aspects in a distributed decision-makers framework, impose a socio-technical system design able to achieve organisational reflexivity. In such settings, executive support systems (ESS) are increasingly becoming necessary for executives to collect, process, and disseminate information in a constantly changing global world in which fast decisions are key issues to business competitiveness. Based on these assumptions an integrated agent-based architecture for ESS is proposed and discussed. The perspective includes three main categories of question: a) how does the computer serve the human to perform better his task? b) what impact has the man-machine system on the operational performance of the managed process? and c) how the human status and working conditions are affected by the presence of computers.",,第3页.xls
43,Hierarchic social entropy and behavioral difference: new measures of robot group diversity,2001,"As research expands in multiagent intelligent systems, investigators need new tools for evaluating the artificial societies they study. It is impossible, for example, to correlate heterogeneity with performance in multiagent robotics without a quantitative metric of diversity. Currently diversity is evaluated on a bipolar scale with systems classified as either heterogeneous or homogeneous, depending on whether any of the agents differ. Unfortunately, this labeling does not tell us much about the extent of diversity in heterogeneous teams. How can it be determined if one system is more or less diverse than another? Heterogeneity must be evaluated on a continuous scale to enable substantive comparisons between systems. To enable these types of comparisons, we introduce: (1) a continuous measure of robot behavioral difference, and (2) hierarchic social entropy, an application of Shannon's information entropy metric to robotic groups that provides a continuous, quantitative measure of robot team diversity. The metric captures important components of the meaning of diversity, including the number and size of behavioral groups in a society and the extent to which agents differ. The utility of the metrics is demonstrated in the experimental evaluation of multirobot soccer and multirobot foraging teams.",,第3页.xls

47,A simulation approach for evaluation and improvement of organisational planning in collaborative product development projects,2009,"Human behaviour and organisational structure impact collaborative product development outcome on a large scale. Therefore, companies are continuously seeking new opportunities to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and predictability of their collaborative product development projects, and to develop innovative principles for organisational design and management such as multi-functional teams. However, there are many factors which have to be considered and assessed to systematically optimise organisational planning in respect of team configuration, structure organisation, and human behaviour. This paper proposes an agent-based simulation methodology to evaluate and improve the organisational planning in complex product development projects. An agent-based integrated simulation model is formulated which can explicitly represent human behaviour, organisational interactions, and tasks networks. Based on the model, the design agent structure and behaviour protocols are studied in detail, and a simulation platform is developed. Finally, the methodology is evaluated in a collaborative roadway design project, and several management insights are established, which are proven to be effective for the organisational optimisation. The results of the case study also show that the methodology can effectively support the evaluation and improvement of organisational planning.",,第3页.xls
48,Chatbot-based Emotion Management for Distributed Teams: A Participatory Design Study,2020,"Fueled by the pervasion of tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, the usage of text-based communication in distributed teams has grown massively in organizations. This brings distributed teams many advantages, however, a critical shortcoming in these setups is the decreased ability of perceiving, understanding and regulating emotions. This is problematic because better team members? abilities of emotion management positively impact team-level outcomes like team cohesion and team performance, while poor abilities diminish communication flow and well-being. Leveraging chatbot technology in distributed teams has been recognized as a promising approach to reintroduce and improve upon these abilities. In this article we present three chatbot designs for emotion management for distributed teams. In order to develop these designs, we conducted three participatory design workshops which resulted in 153 sketches. Subsequently, we evaluated the designs following an exploratory evaluation with 27 participants. Results show general stimulating effects on emotion awareness and communication efficiency. Further, they report emotion regulation and increased compromise facilitation through social and interactive design features, but also perceived threats like loss of control. With some design features adversely impacting emotion management, we highlight design implications and discuss chatbot design recommendations for enhancing emotion management in teams.",,第3页.xls
49,Communication Censoring in Decentralized Fictitious Play for the Target Assignment Problem,2020,"We consider a target assignment problem for a team of mobile autonomous agents. Agents utilize a wireless communication network subject to failures to determine which target each agent should cover. Being unaware of each others' locations and which targets they intend to cover, each agent has control over its mobility and communication in addition to which target they select. Given the setup, we propose a decentralized algorithm based on the distributed fictitious play algorithm in which agents reason about the selections to decide which target to select, whether to communicate or not, and where to move. Numerical experiments illustrate physical coverage of targets in finite time and the potential benefits of communication censoring.",,第3页.xls
50,EVOLVABLE SIMULATIONS APPLIED TO AUTOMATED RED TEAMING: A PRELIMINARY STUDY,2010,"We report preliminary studies on evolvable simulations applied to Automated Red Teaming (ART). ART is a vulnerability assessment tool in which agent-based models of simplified military scenarios are repeatedly and automatically generated, executed and varied. Nature-inspired heuristic techniques are utilized to drive the exploration of simulation models to exhibit desired system behaviors. To date, ART investigations have essentially addressed the evolution of a limited fixed set of parameters determining the agents' behavior. We propose to extend ART to widen the range of evolvable simulation model parameters. Using this evolvable simulation approach, we conduct experiments in which the agents' structure is evolved. Specifically, a maritime scenario is examined where the individual trajectories of belligerent vessels are evolved to break Blue. These experiments are conducted using a modular evolutionary framework coined CASE. The results present counter-intuitive outcomes and suggest that evolvable simulation is a promising technique to enhance ART.",,第3页.xls

A range of organizational strategies have emerged from this line of research, each with different strengths and weaknesses. In this article we present a survey of the major organizational paradigms used in multi-agent systems. These include hierarchies, holarchies, coalitions, teams, congregations, societies, federations, markets, and matrix organizations. We will provide a description of each, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and provide examples of how they may be instantiated and maintained. This summary will facilitate the comparative evaluation of organizational styles, allowing designers to first recognize the spectrum of possibilities, and then guiding the selection of an appropriate organizational design for a particular domain and environment.",,第3页.xls
52,Distributed optimization with the consideration of adaptivity and finite-time convergence,2014,"In this paper, a distributed optimization problem is studied for continuous-time multi-agent systems with single integrator dynamics. The objective is for multiple agents to cooperatively optimize a team performance function formed by a sum of convex local objective functions with only local interaction and information while explicitly taking into account adaptivity and finite-time convergence. The continuous-time algorithms have applications in motion coordination of multi-agent systems. First, a distributed algorithm with a signum function is introduced for a class of convex local objective functions. A corresponding condition is then given to guarantee that all agents reach a consensus in finite time while minimizing the team performance function. Second, an adaptive distributed algorithm is presented. It is shown that the interaction gain of each agent can be adaptively adjusted according to the variation of the gradients of the convex local objective functions, and the algorithm can deal with general differentiable convex local objective functions. Third, a distributed tracking algorithm combined with a distributed estimation algorithm is proposed for a class of convex local objective functions. It is shown that all agents reach a consensus while minimizing the team performance function in finite time. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.",,第3页.xls

54,Towards Automatic Code Generation for Robotic Soccer Behavior Simulation,2024,"Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are an Artificial Intelligence (AI) branch where agents handle distributed nature tasks in a cooperative system. MAS is widely used in robotic systems in scenarios where multiple robots must cooperate. In this direction, the robot soccer domain has been used as a test bed to stimulate research in this area, as it reproduces some important features of these systems, such as coordination. Each soccer team member is an agent whose behavior must be coordinated with the other team members cooperating to win the game. Simulation tools are frequently used in this context to create rehearsed plays, called setplays, during team training. However, these tools generally have a limited set of behaviors, e.g., kicking, available to use in setplays, and new behaviors must be manually implemented. This implementation requires knowledge of specific source codes and a significant programming effort, in addition to leaving the behavior coupled and dependent on the tool. This work proposes the Robot Soccer Behavior Generator (RoboSocBG), a solution to develop new behaviors in the context of simulated soccer robots. It uses Model-Driven Development (MDD), an approach that enables the specification of behavior platform-independent models and code generation in specific tools. The solution was tested in our laboratory and validated in a case study. The results evidenced its feasibility to generate code in different platforms.",,第3页.xls
55,Behavioral diversity as multiagent cooperation,1999,"In many cases cooperation between robots is implemented using explicit, perhaps complex, coordination protocols. However, research in behavior-based multirobot systems suggests that effective cooperative teams can be composed of agents using simple individual agent behaviors with limited or no communication. In this paper we propose behavioral diversity as an alternative cooperative strategy. Behavioral diversity refers to the extent to which agents assume distinct behavioral roles in a group. By filling diverse roles the team members distribute responsibility for various components of the task. It is not always the case, however, that diversity is advantageous. Results of experiments in robotic soccer and multirobot foraging tasks indicate that the utility of diversity depends on the task. This paper describes behaviorally diverse solutions to these tasks and provides a comparison that suggests why some tasks are suited for behavioral diversity and others are not.",,第3页.xls
56,Information aggregation in a beauty contest game,2014,"We consider a repeated game in which a team of agents share a common, but only partially known, task. The team also has the goal to coordinate while completing the task. This creates a trade-off between estimating the task and coordinating with others reminiscent of the kind of trade-off exemplified by the Keynesian beauty contest game. The agents thus can benefit from learning from others. This paper provides a survey of results from [1-4]. We first present a recent result that states repeated play of the game by myopic but Bayesian agents, who observe the actions of their neighbors over a connected network, eventually yield coordination on a single action. Furthermore, the coordinated action is equal to the mean estimate of the common task given individual's information. This indicates that agents in the network have the same mean estimate in the limit despite the differences in the quality of local information. Finally, we state that if the space of signals is a finite set, the coordinated action is equal to the estimate of the common task given full information, that is, agents eventually aggregate the information available throughout the network on the common task optimally.",,第3页.xls

58,Knowledge-Based Multiagent Credit Assignment: A Study on Task Type and Critic Information,2007,"Multiagent credit assignment (MCA) is one of the major problems in the realization of multiagent reinforcement learning. Since the environment usually is not intelligent enough to qualify individual agents in a cooperative team, it is very important to develop some methods for assigning individual agents' credits when just a single team reinforcement is available. MCA cannot be solved in general cases, using a single technique. Therefore, our goal in this research is first to present a new view of the problem and second, to introduce a new idea of using agents' knowledge to partially solve MCA. In this research, an approach that is based on agents' learning histories and knowledge is proposed to solve the MCA problem. Knowledge evaluation-based credit assignment (KEBCA) along with certainty, a measure of agents' knowledge, is developed to judge agents' actions and to assign them proper credits. The proposed KEBCA method is general, however; we study it in some simulated extreme cases in order to gain a better insight into MCA problem and to evaluate our approach in such cases. More specifically, we study the effects of task type (AND-type and OR-type tasks) on solving MCA problem in two cases. In the first case, in addition to the team reinforcement, it is assumed that some extra information at the team level is available. In the second case, such extra information does not exist. In addition, performance of the system is examined in presence of some uncertainties in the environment, modeled as noise on agents' actions. The information content of team reinforcements and assumed extra information are theoretically calculated and discussed. The mathematical calculations confirm the related simulation results.",,第3页.xls
59,Learning to role-switch in multi-robot systems,2003,"We present an approach that uses Q-learning on individual robotic agents, for coordinating a mission-tasked team of robots in a complex scenario. To reduce the size of the state space, actions are grouped into sets Of related behaviors called roles and represented as behavioral assemblages. A role is a Finite State Automata such as Forager, where the behaviors and their sequencing for finding objects, collecting them, and returning them are already encoded and do not have to be relearned. Each robot starts out with the same set of possible roles to play, the same perceptual hardware for coordination, and no contact other than perception regarding other members of the team. Over the course of training, a team of Q-learning robots will converge to solutions that best the performance of a well-designed handcrafted homogeneous team.",,第3页.xls
60,"Multi-agent systems interacting (addressing scopes, control resources)",2019,"Multi-agent systems consist of agents and their environment. the agents in a multi-agent system could equally well be robots, humans or human teams. And may contain combined human-agent. Multi-agent systems can be used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include some methodic, functional, procedural approach, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning. In a system with agents that have their own objectives and schedules, when tasks are dependent on one another or when resources are to be shared, it can be important to add the function of coordination to the system, otherwise there is a risk of redundancy or even of a locked situation occurring. With the modeling in Event-B we are now ready to make precise what we mean by a faultless system, which represents our ultimate goal as the title of this prologue indicates.

61,Interactive multimodal learning: towards using pedagogical agents for inclusive education,2023,"A pedagogical agent is an animated interface in an interactive online learning environment. Its role involves guiding users through instructions and participating in direct discussions. Numerous research studies underline the advantages of pedagogical agents in delivering instruction, tailoring learning experiences, and promoting inclusivity. The authors utilize machine learning techniques to develop an interactive multimodal application (combining visuals and audio) designed as a pedagogical agent. This application is intended to assist in teaching primary school students (aged 6 to 8) the recognition of colors and letters. Additionally, it incorporates voice interaction to assess their learning progress. The overarching objective of this pedagogical agent is to seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into educational settings, thereby amplifying student engagement and motivation during the learning process. This paper will explore the journey of creating a machine learning-based application and its potential utility in supporting educators. Furthermore, the authors will investigate potential augmentations that could render the application more adept at aiding students with dyslexia.

R&D teams have no time to organize project information nor to articulate the rationale behind the actions that generate the information. Our aim is to provide a system for helping the team members to make knowledge explicit and to allow them to share their experiences, i.e., lessons learned (LL), without asking them too much extra-work. The article focuses on how we intend to help the team members to feed the system with LL, using the operations they perform on desktop computers, and how we intend to exploit the LL by using a case-based reasoning engine.

The research includes design and implementation of robotic soccer simulation algorithms in a multi-agent environment. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy two-phase approach, based on our previous crisp two-phase mechanism, for the soccer player agent's action selection. To do so, a fuzzy decision making approach was implemented which tells an agent what action to take, in a given situation. In comparison with similar implementations, our approach is faster and simpler to follow. This method is integrated into our Nexus soccer simulation team of Ferdowsi University. The outcome showed the superiority of the fuzzy two-phase selection method compared to the non-fuzzy one.",,第3页.xls

67,"Integrating individual, organizational and market level reasoning for agent coordination",2000,"In this paper we articulate a multi-level view of agent coordination and provide solutions for an integrated agent architecture that addresses all the levels. At the individual agent level, we model the decision making problem faced by individual agents that need to discover their highest utility goals and the plans to achieve them. Individual level plans normally contain goals that lie outside the agent's control. To achieve them, the agent needs to team up with other agents in the organization. At the organizational level, we show how organizational structures can be used to form the minimum cost teams needed to achieve such goals. Individual and organizational reasoning rely on knowing the utilities of the options available to agents. Often, these utilities are not given in advance, they must be discovered dynamically by market driven interaction. At the market level, we give a constraint optimization formulation to Multi Attribute Utility Theory and introduce interaction processes that allow agents to discover how to cooperate to optimize their objectives. All levels translate their specific models into a common reasoning infrastructure integrating randomized and systematic search.",,第3页.xls
68,A Behavior-Based Population Tracker Can Parse Aggregate Measurements to Differentiate Agents,2019,"Closed-loop state estimators that track the movements and behaviors of large-scale populations have significant potential to benefit emergency teams during the critical early stages of disaster response. Such population trackers could enable insight about the population even where few direct measurements are available. In concept, a population tracker might be realized using a Bayesian estimation framework to fuse agent-based models of human movement and behavior with sparse sensing, such as a small set of cameras providing population counts at specific locations. We describe a simple proof-of-concept for such an estimator by applying a particle-filter to synthetic sensor data generated from a small simulated environment. An interesting result is that behavioral models embedded in the particle filter make it possible to distinguish among simulated agents, even when the only available sensor data are aggregate population counts at specific locations.",,第3页.xls
69,Simulating inter-organizational collaboration network: a multi-relational and event-based approach,2012,"In this research, we study inter-organizational collaboration from the perspective of multi-relational networks. We develop an agent-based model to simulate how a collaboration network among organizations emerges from organizations' interactions through another network: the inter-organizational communication network. Our model adds links (or edges) into the collaboration network on the basis of events, which correspond to organizations' formation of collaborative teams for joint projects. The proposed approach also models the competitive yet non-exclusive dissemination of information among organizations, organizations' dynamic prioritization of candidate projects, and network-based influence. Applying the model to a case study of the humanitarian sector, we configure and validate the agent-based simulation, and use it to analyze how to promote inter-organizational humanitarian collaboration by encouraging communication. The simulation results suggest that encouraging communication between peripheral organizations can better promote collaboration than other strategies.",,第3页.xls
70,R-CAST-MED: Applying intelligent agents to support emergency medical decision-making teams,2007,"Decision-making is a crucial aspect of emergency response during mass casualty incidents (MCIs). MCIs require rapid decisions to be taken by geographically-dispersed teams in an environment characterized by insufficient information, ineffective collaboration and inadequate resources. Despite the increasing adoption of decision support systems in healthcare, there is limited evidence of their value in large-scale disasters. We conducted focus groups with emergency medical services and emergency department personnel who revealed that one of the main challenges in emergency response during MCIs is information management. Therefore, to alleviate the issues arising from ineffective information management, we propose R-CAST-MED, an intelligent agent architecture built on Recognition-Primed Decision-making (RPD) and Shared Mental Models (SMMs). A simulation of R-CAST-MED showed that this tool enabled efficient information management by identifying relevant information, inferring missing information and sharing information with other agents, which led to effective collaboration and coordination of tasks across teams.",,第3页.xls
71,Quantum-Like Interdependence Theory Advances Autonomous Human-Machine Teams (A-HMTs),2020,"As humanity grapples with the concept of autonomy for human-machine teams (A-HMTs), unresolved is the necessity for the control of autonomy that instills trust. For non-autonomous systems in states with a high degree of certainty, rational approaches exist to solve, model or control stable interactions; e.g., game theory, scale-free network theory, multi-agent systems, drone swarms. As an example, guided by artificial intelligence (AI, including machine learning, ML) or by human operators, swarms of drones have made spectacular gains in applications too numerous to list (e.g., crop management; mapping, surveillance and fire-fighting systems; weapon systems). But under states of uncertainty or where conflict exists, rational models fail, exactly where interdependence theory thrives. Large, coupled physical or information systems can also experience synergism or dysergism from interdependence. Synergistically, the best human teams are not only highly interdependent, but they also exploit interdependence to reduce uncertainty, the focus of this work-in-progress and roadmap. We have long argued that interdependence is fundamental to human autonomy in teams. But for A-HMTs, no mathematics exists to build from rational theory or social science for their design nor safe or effective operation, a severe weakness. Compared to the rational and traditional social theory, we hope to advance interdependence theory first by mapping similarities between quantum theory and our prior findings; e.g., to maintain interdependence, we previously established that boundaries reduce dysergic effects to allow teams to function (akin to blocking interference to prevent quantum decoherence). Second, we extend our prior findings with case studies to predict with interdependence theory that as uncertainty increases in non-factorable situations for humans, the duality in two-sided beliefs serves debaters who explore alternatives with tradeoffs in the search for the best path going forward. Third, applied to autonomous teams, we conclude that a machine in an A-HMT must be able to express itself to its human teammates in causal language however imperfectly.",,第3页.xls

In particular, relatively low fidelity simulations were employed to visualize the results of particular courses of action. Over four days multiple courses of action were developed by two opposing teams with similar force structures and then run against one another in an agent based modeling environment to test their ability to achieve the given mission. The results of the experiment indicate that there is significant potential for low fidelity simulations to stimulate objective thinking in course of action development.",,第3页.xls
73,Simulating the dynamics of social agents and information flows in BIM-based design,2018,"Design work entails collaboration that increasingly requires dynamic and complex information exchanges among multi-disciplinary teams. Although Building Information Modelling (BIM) is frequently advocated as a solution to myriad issues, poor workflow still plagues the design process resulting in rework, delays, cost overruns, and errors which are detrimental to the project. This can be attributed to a lack of consideration of inherent problems in communication and behaviours of design teams when adopting BIM. This study aims to examine whether BIM adoption can improve design workflow by concurrently considering social interaction mechanisms and information flow dynamics. Accordingly, the research method adopts agent-based modelling and social network analysis to analyse and measure information flow in BIM-based design. Cross-analyses of results from a case study indicate that using BIM as production tool does not explicitly improve workflow or achieve the full potential unless fundamental conditions are present, namely collaboration and changes in traditional mindsets.",,第3页.xls

75,The Guilty (Silicon) Mind: Blameworthiness and Liability in Human-Machine Teaming [arXiv],2022,"As human science pushes the boundaries towards the development of artificial intelligence (AI), the sweep of progress has caused scholars and policymakers alike to question the legality of applying or utilising AI in various human endeavours. For example, debate has raged in international scholarship about the legitimacy of applying AI to weapon systems to form lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS). Yet the argument holds true even when AI is applied to a military autonomous system that is not weaponised: how does one hold a machine accountable for a crime? What about a tort? Can an artificial agent understand the moral and ethical content of its instructions? These are thorny questions, and in many cases these questions have been answered in the negative, as artificial entities lack any contingent moral agency. So what if the AI is not alone, but linked with or overseen by a human being, with their own moral and ethical understandings and obligations? Who is responsible for any malfeasance that may be committed? Does the human bear the legal risks of unethical or immoral decisions by an AI? These are some of the questions this manuscript seeks to engage with.",,第3页.xls
76,Coordinating UAVs in Dynamic Environments by Network-Aware Mission Planning,2014,"Traditional AI planning has been used successfully in many domains, including logistics, scheduling and game playing. This paper examines how AI planning techniques can be extended to coordinate teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments. Specifically challenging are real-world environments where UAVs and other network-enabled devices must communicate to coordinate- and communication actions are neither reliable nor free. Such network-centric environments are common in military, public safety and commercial applications, yet most planning research (even multi-agent planning) usually takes communications among distributed agents as a given. The emerging application challenge of unmanned systems makes this problem of central focus. This work examines the problem of planning, plan monitoring and coordination of the mission of multiple UAVs in a communication-constrained environment. The work introduces several abstractions that enable AI planners to reason about communication and networking knowledge; and provides the underlying network system the means for including mission data as part of network operations. This work has been empirically validated using a distributed network-centric software evaluation testbed and the results provide guidance to designers in how to understand and control intelligent systems that operate in these environments.",,第3页.xls
77,Improving multi-agent coordination with an approach based on a distributed rational decision-making model,2001,"The problem of coordination in multi-agent systems remains one of the most critical to be solved, due to its changing nature, which can bring out many conflicting situations during a decision-making process. The coordination and decision-making rely, usually, on the sole responsibility of a coordinator agent. Thus, the potential contributions of the rest of the agents, in the decision-making process, are not taken into account, and the global utility could be considerably reduced. A coordination approach for multi-agent domains based on a distributed rational decision-making model is proposed, which aims to improve the global utility. It is applied in the dynamic world of soccer agents and, more precisely, to the problem of coordinating agents in offensive team strategies. In order to take into account the contribution of all of the agents involved in a given play, a distributed representation of a Q-learning mechanism is proposed. This representation will help to compute the risk and utility values related to a set of actions applied to a given situation.

Autonomous air vehicles (AAVs) that are equipped with electronic support (ES) sensor systems, provide a means of extending search capabilities beyond the visual horizon and detecting such emitters. However, detection alone is not sufficient, and so by applying multiple AAVs acting cooperatively, the location of the emitter can be determined by appropriate data fusion processing of the information about the intercepted emitter pulses. Geolocation of the emitter of interest can be achieved by a method known as time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) processing, and requires a team of cooperative receivers separated by a suitable distance. Team formation between autonomous agent entities requires the presence of a mechanism by which cooperative team links can be established. These linkages between agents come about because of the presence of driving forces that develop between the agents. In the system of multiple autonomous air vehicles, the objective is to fuse the various capabilities of the AAVs into a coherent entity that can perform geolocation of a radar emitter. First, the TDOA algorithm is described. Then, the set of behaviours for each AAV are described and the reasoning architecture that enables the individual AAVs to behave collectively to accomplish their mission objective is presented.",,第3页.xls
79,Strategy description and modelling for multi-agent systems,2008,"The field of robot soccer provides numerous opportunities for the application of AI methods for game strategy development. Robot soccer is a part of standard applications of distributed system control in real time. The software part of a distributed control system is realized by decision making and executive agents. The algorithm of agents' cooperation was proposed with the control agent on a higher level. The algorithms for agents realized in robots are the same. Real-time dynamic simple strategy description and strategy learning possibility based on game observation is important for discovering opponents strategies and searching for tactical group movements, simulation and synthesis of suitable counter-strategies. For the improvement of game strategy, we are developing an abstract description of the game and propose ways to use this description (e.g. for learning rules and adapting team strategies to every single opponent).",,第3页.xls

Using intelligent agents may diminish the need for staff. However, to achieve,goal-directed training, events in the simulation as well its the behavior of key players must be carefully controlled.

82,Non-communicative multi-robot coordination in dynamic environments,2005,"Within a group of cooperating agents the decision making of an individual agent depends on the actions of the other agents. In dynamic environments, these dependencies will change rapidly as a result of the continuously changing state. Via a context-specific decomposition of the problem into smaller subproblems, coordination graphs offer scalable solutions to the problem of multiagent decision making. In this work, we apply coordination graphs to a continuous (robotic) domain by assigning roles to the agents and then coordinating the different roles. Moreover, we demonstrate that, with some additional assumptions, an agent can predict the actions of the other agents, rendering communication superfluous. We have successfully implemented the proposed method into our UvA Trilearn simulated robot soccer team which won the RoboCup-2003 World Championship in Padova, Italy. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

84,A learning automata approach to multi-agent policy gradient learning,2008,"The policy gradient method is a popular technique for implementing reinforcement learning in an agent system. One of the reasons is that a policy gradient learner has a simple design and strong theoretical properties in single-agent domains. Previously, Williams showed that the REINFORCE algorithm is a special case of policy gradient learning. He also showed that a learning automaton could be seen as a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm. Learning automata theory guarantees that a group of automata will converge to a stable equilibrium in team games. In this paper we will show a theoretical connection between learning automata and policy gradient methods to transfer this theoretical result to multi-agent policy gradient learning. An appropriate exploration technique is crucial for the convergence of a multi-agent system. Since learning automata are guaranteed to converge, they posses such an exploration. We identify the identical mapping of a learning automaton onto the Boltzmann exploration strategy with an suitable temperature setting. The novel idea is that the temperature of the Boltzmann function is not dependent on time but on the action probabilities of the agents.",,第3页.xls

A greater understanding of two-way trust between humans and artificial agents is a topic of interest for situations when the human makes mistakes or an anomalous situation such as an enemy combatant taking control of friendly AI. The purpose of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art regarding two-way trust research in Human-Adaptive Agent teams.

87,Multi-agency Is Coordination and (Limited) Communication,2014,"Systems within the agent-oriented paradigm range from ones where a single agent is coupled with an environment to ones inhabited by a large number of autonomous entities. In this paper, we look at what distinguishes single-agent systems from multi-agent systems. We claim that multi-agency implies limited coordination, in terms of action and/or information. If a team is characterized by full coordination both on the level of action choice and the available information, then we may as well see the team as a single agent in disguise. To back the claim formally, we consider a variant of Alternating-time Temporal Logic ATL where each coalition operates with a single indistinguishability relation. For this variant, we propose a truth-preserving translation of formulas and models in the syntactic fragment of ATL where only singleton coalitions are allowed. In consequence, we show that assuming unified view of the world on part of each coalition reduces the full language of ATL to its single-agent fragment when a model is given.",,第3页.xls

91,Supporting concurrent design teams with adjustably autonomous agents,1999,"Summary form only given. Successful deployment of knowledge-based systems in design is very limited. It has been suggested that one reason for this is that models of design have focused upon what machines can do and not on how designers actually design. The Cognitive Engineering Research Programme is seeking to achieve this goal by developing a better understanding of how we should design interactive systems through studying people and organisations. Oxman (1995) offers an approach to this through the development of an integrated understanding of design theory, cognitive science and computing. This paper describes work which attempts to address some of the issues above by studying concurrent engineering designers to identify (some of) the dynamics of the concurrent design process and examine ways in which these might be captured in computational approaches to support design activity.

95,Decentralized decision making in adaptive multi-robot teams,2018,"We present our decision support middleware PROViDE that facilitates decentralized decision making in multi-robot teams operating in highly dynamic environments with potentially unreliable communication channels and noisy sensors. Achieving an adaptive team behavior in such an environment is a challenge because the specific conditions require a fully decentralized decision process. The design of PROViDE borrows inspiration from human decision making processes. PROViDE supports replication of proposals, conflict resolution, and final team-decision making. For each of these steps a choice of methods is offered to the developer to provide flexibility for different application requirements and characteristics of execution environments. PROViDE is integrated into a comprehensive modeling framework for multi-robot systems. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: For the development of adaptive multi-robot teams we discuss requirements for a middleware that supports decentralized decision making in dynamic and adverse environments, and we demonstrate the effective and coherent integration of a set of domain-dependent decision support protocols into a middleware framework.",,第3页.xls
96,Multi-skill agents coalition formation under skill uncertainty,2011,"In a multi-agent system, there are situations in which agents are unable to do their tasks individually. Therefore forming coalitions is inevitable. In natural settings, an agent decides to form coalition based on beliefs it has regarding the capabilities of other agents. In the previous works, it was assumed that a single type can reflects all capabilities an agent has. We introduce multi-skill agents which have a value per skill. This helps us to solve more problems and to reason about the results, more exactly. We use Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) as the learning mechanism. Through the repeated use of BRL, agents can form more rewarding coalitions. We extend existing algorithms of the repeated coalition formation under type uncertainty to the skill uncertainty and exploit them in experimental studies that type uncertainty couldn't do or reason about. Average long term discounted expected reward that agents accumulate in the learning process, is the criteria we test our methods based on. We test the algorithms on a sample soccer sub-team formation problem. To have a notion of the best performance, we solve the problem in the absence of uncertainty. Results show that the VPI method does approximately 85% of the best performance.",,第3页.xls

However, integrating diverse expertise requires that the experts have some mechanism for dealing with conflicts that occur during problem-solving. The authors describe the cooperating experts framework (CEF), a framework developed to support cooperative problem solving among sets of knowledge-based systems with limited information about each other's local states. The systems solve subproblems relevant to their specific expertise and integrate their efforts using conflict resolution strategies that are appropriate to the problem solving context. In choosing a strategy CEF makes tradeoffs between the potential quality of a solution, the amount of processing requires to apply a strategy, and the effect of local changes on the global solution. The authors also describe TEAM, a system implemented in the CEF framework, that designs stream condensers.",,第3页.xls

Recent interest in the Internet and related technology has led quickly to the concept of an intelligent software agent which can make sense of the volume of information present in cyberspace.

We term this activity a monitoring agent. Numerous papers have illustrated problems regarding the current signal-to-noise ratio of information on the Internet, and the resulting need for agents. We believe that obtaining information quickly is only part of the reason for the long-term viability of the Internet, software must also be able to monitor information desired by users and inform them of only those changes which are considered important.

104,A process-agent construction method for software process modeling in SoftPM,2006,"Software development, unlike manufacturing industry, is highly dependent on the capabilities of individual software engineers and software development teams.

105,Towards adjustable autonomy for the real world,2002,"Adjustable autonomy refers to entities dynamically varying their own autonomy, transferring decision-making control to other entities (typically agents transferring control to human users) in key situations. Determining whether and when such transfers-of-control should occur is arguably the fundamental research problem in adjustable autonomy. Previous work has investigated various approaches to addressing this problem but has often focused on individual agent-human interactions. Unfortunately, domains requiring collaboration between teams of agents and humans reveal two key shortcomings of these previous approaches. First, these approaches use rigid one-shot transfers of control that can result in unacceptable coordination failures in multiagent settings. Second, they ignore costs (e.g., in terms of time delays or effects on actions) to an agent's team due to such transfers-of-control.To remedy these problems, this article presents a novel approach to adjustable autonomy, based on the notion of a transfer-of-control strategy. A transfer-of-control strategy consists of a conditional sequence of two types of actions: (i) actions to transfer decision-making control (e.g., from an agent to a user or vice versa) and (ii) actions to change an agent's pre-specified coordination constraints with team members, aimed at minimizing miscoordination costs. The goal is for high-quality individual decisions to be made with minimal disruption to the coordination of the team. We present a mathematical model of transfer-of-control strategies. The model guides and informs the operationalization of the strategies using Markov Decision Processes, which select an optimal strategy, given an uncertain environment and costs to the individuals and teams. The approach has been carefully evaluated, including via its use in a real-world, deployed multi-agent system that assists a research group in its daily activities.",,第3页.xls

In this paper, we argue that this issue can be more effectively solved if agents are equipped with a consistent global view. We achieve this by requiring agents to follow an interacting protocol. The properties of the protocol are derived and theoretically analyzed. A distributed protocol that satisfies these properties is presented. The experimental evaluations are conducted for a well-known test-case (i.e., pursuit game) in the context of two teaming algorithms. The results show that the protocol is effective and the reinforcement teaming algorithms using it perform much better.",,第3页.xls

Efficient distribution control can further improve the results and utilize the resources among agents. In this paper, we exploit multi-soccer agents to tackle a human resource management system. By considering the soccer tactics and team formation, the system can distribute the resources more evenly. In addition, various local constraints are appended to evaluate the system. The evaluation shows that soccer agents are able to produce a better allocation plan compared with various brute-force and heuristic search algorithms. Moreover, we describe the implementation of both centralized and decentralized control in terms of the coach-and-players approach of soccer agents. We also introduce a new concept of a virtual synchronized clock in the distributed control in order to speed up the decision-making without negotiations among the agents.",,第3页.xls
108,Effects of the Perspectives that Influenced on the Human Mental Stance in the Multiple-to-Multiple Human,2017,"Virtual agents are useful for simulations of real-world events or processes designed for solving a problem, such as serious games and gamifications. In several types of the virtual world simulations, multiple-to-multiple interaction is needed because our social interaction is multiple-to-multiple in many cases. In this study, we extended the agent behavior model that induces intentional stance in one-to-one human-agent interaction, which was proposed in our previous works, to the multiple-to-multiple human-agent interaction. By using the agent group, we investigated effects of the perspectives that influenced the human mental stance in the multiple-to-multiple human-agent interaction. To investigate the effects of the perspectives, we changed the viewpoints (subjective or objective) in different perspectives (physical or mental) when people interacted with a team of agents in the virtual futsal game. As a result, we can find that there is a different effect between the physical perspective and the mental perspective. The subjective viewpoint of the physical perspective enhanced the feeling of the agent team's intelligence, but the objective viewpoint of the mental perspective enhanced the feeling of the agent team's intelligence.

Experimental results show that our method effectively achieves clever pass selection by midfielders in full games.

111,Collaborative design of structures using intelligent agents,2002,"The construction industry has a long tradition of collaborative working between the members of a construction project team. At the design stage, this has traditionally been based on physical meetings between representatives of the principal design disciplines. To aid these meetings, the information and communications technologies that are currently available have been utilised. These have yielded some success but are hampered by the problems posed by the use of heterogeneous software tools and the lack of effective collaboration tools that are necessary to collapse the time and distance constraints, within which increasingly global design teams work. In particular, there are very few tools available to support distributed asynchronous collaboration. Distributed artificial intelligence, which is commonly implemented in the form of intelligent agents, offers considerable potential for the development of such tools. This paper examines some of the issues associated with the use of distributed artificial intelligence systems within the construction industry. It describes the potential for the use of agent technology in collaborative design and then goes on to present the key features of an agent-based system for the collaborative design of portal frame structures. An example is presented to demonstrate the working and benefits of the prototype system. which makes a significant contribution by allowing for peer to peer negotiation between the design agents.

Other parts of the player program are implemented in a multi-level manner. In other words, in the lowest level there are simple skills which only use the WorldModel for undertaking their duties, whereas more complex skills in higher levels use the WorldModel and the lower level skills to achieve their goal.

114,Multiagent Task Allocation in Complementary Teams: A Hunter-and-Gatherer Approach,2020,"Consider a dynamic task allocation problem, where tasks are unknowingly distributed over an environment. This paper considers each task comprising two sequential subtasks: detection and completion, where each subtask can only be carried out by a certain type of agent. We address this problem using a novel nature-inspired approach called hunter and gatherer. The proposed method employs two complementary teams of agents: one agile in detecting (hunters) and another skillful in completing (gatherers) the tasks. To minimize the collective cost of task accomplishments in a distributed manner, a game-theoretic solution is introduced to couple agents from complementary teams. We utilize market-based negotiation models to develop incentive-based decision-making algorithms relying on innovative notions of certainty and uncertainty profit margins. The simulation results demonstrate that employing two complementary teams of hunters and gatherers can effectually improve the number of tasks completed by agents compared to conventional methods, while the collective cost of accomplishments is minimized. In addition, the stability and efficacy of the proposed solutions are studied using Nash equilibrium analysis and statistical analysis, respectively. It is also numerically shown that the proposed solutions function fairly; that is, for each type of agent, the overall workload is distributed equally.",,第3页.xls

An event-driven simulation model is developed to investigate how system design parameters affect the search and task performance of cooperative multi agent teams. In this study we focus on the problem of Uninhabited Air Vehicles (UAVs) searching for targets in an uncertain environment. We have previously presented a model-based decision-making and task-allocation methodology for this problem. In this paper, we investigate how the choice of two critically important parameters in the algorithm influence the performance of the UAV team. We evaluate the effect of these parameters on six different performance measures: 1) total mission time; 2) classification error rate; 3) target neutralization time; 4) task attempt times; 5) target miss ratio; and 6) task-driven traveling distance. The results provide valuable intuition on the selection of system design parameters based on different mission requirements.",,第3页.xls

Through this agent, the user specifies a start and an end point, and describes the composition and characteristics of a military platoon. Two aided conditions and one non-aided condition were examined. In the first aided condition, a route-planning agent (known as the Autonomous RPA) determines a minimum cost path between the specified end points. The user is allowed to define additional intangible constraints that describe situational or social information that should be considered when determining the route. In the second aided condition, a different agent, the Cooperative RPA, uses the same knowledge of the terrain and cost functions available to the Autonomous RPA, but restricts its search to paths within regions drawn by the user. In the unaided condition, Naive RPA, the user draws the route manually, then submits it to be tested against the terrain and cost functions for feasibility. Both aided conditions are superior to the control but differ in their relative effectiveness by scenario. In this paper we examine the varieties of challenges faced by commanders in two scenarios and relate them to the differential effectiveness of the agents.",,第3页.xls
120,A physically grounded approach to coordinate movements in a team,2002,"This paper focuses on the problem of coordinating the Movements of a cooperative team in an environment, and proposes an approach that takes inspiration from the laws of physics. The idea is to have the movements of team members driven by, abstract force fields, generated by, team members themselves (i.e., by, carried-on devices) and propagated via sonic embedded infrastructure (or by, team members in an ad-hoc way). A globally, coordinated and self-organized behavior in team members, movements emerges due to the interrelated effects of team members following the shape of the fields and of dynamic fields re-shaping. A case study, in the area of warehouse management is introduced to exemplify the proposed approach.",,第3页.xls

122,"Multi-agent role allocation: issues, approaches, and multiple perspectives",2011,"In cooperative multi-agent systems, roles are used as a design concept when creating large systems, they are known to facilitate specialization of agents, and they can help to reduce interference in multi-robot domains. The types of tasks that the agents are asked to solve and the communicative capabilities of the agents significantly affect the way roles are used in cooperative multi-agent systems. Along with a discussion of these issues about roles in multi-agent systems, this article compares computational models of the role allocation problem, presents the notion of explicitly versus implicitly defined roles, gives a survey of the methods used to approach role allocation problems, and concludes with a list of open research questions related to roles in multi-agent systems.",,第3页.xls
123,Extending Prometheus with Agent Cooperation,2008,"Agent cooperation is a central component of many multi-agent systems. To be successful in open, multi-agent environments, agents must be capable of dynamically forming a team and solving a problem by cooperating with each other. Such an autonomous agent cooperation process has the potential to execute a plan to achieve a common goal. To date numerous methodologies for agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) have been proposed in the literature. However, those methodologies lack the ability to model agent cooperation strategies effectively.This research work proposes a set of artefacts to extend Prometheus development methodology in order to support agent cooperation. We will illustrate the extended Prometheus methodology using an example from the domain of e-commerce. The results are presented and our future work is discussed",,第3页.xls

125,Investigating Usability of Conversational User Interfaces for Integrated System-Physical Interactions: A Medical Device Perspective,2024,"The use of Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) as human-machine interfaces in AI-infused systems has become increasingly popular. However, the existing design guidelines for CUIs are inadequate for meeting the complex interaction requirements of applications involving integrated System-Physical Interaction. In this study, the real-life context of using CUIs as the front-end of AI-enabled medical devices is examined, investigating interaction and usability issues in clinical task operations. Voice- and text-based CUIs were tested with 40 participants to perform clinical tasks. Based on user testing results, a team of seven experts identified 116 unique usability issues and synthesized 16 heuristics using a multilevel thematic coding process. These heuristics were compared to past guidelines to assess their alignment and novelty. Further, 12 usability experts evaluated the heuristics across various clinical systems. The study established that the proposed 16 heuristics provide comprehensive guidance for designing and evaluating CUIs, addressing a wide range of usability requirements.",,第3页.xls

127,A Parallel Evolutionary Algorithm with Value Decomposition for Multi-agent Problems,2020,"Many real-world problems involve cooperation and/or competition among multiple agents. These problems often can be formulated as multi-agent problems. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant progress on single-agent problems. However, multi-agent problems still cannot be easily solved by traditional RL algorithms. First, the multi-agent environment is considered as a non-stationary system. Second, most multi-agent environments only provide a shared team reward as feedback. As a result, agents may not be able to learn proper cooperative or competitive behaviors by traditional RL. Our algorithm adopts Evolution Strategies (ES) for optimizing policy which is used to control agents and a value decomposition method for estimating proper fitness for each policy. Evolutionary Algorithm is considered as a promising alternative for signal-agent problems. Owing to its simplicity, scalability, and efficiency on zeroth-order optimization, EAs can even outperform RLs on some tasks. In order to solve multi-agent problems by EA, a value decomposition method is used to decompose the team reward. Our method is parallel on multiple cores, which can speed up our algorithm significantly. We test our algorithm on two benchmarking environments, and the experiment results show that our algorithm is better than traditional RL and other representative gradient-free methods.",,第3页.xls
128,Exploring an Agent Interaction Modeling System (AIMS) for Human Autonomy Teams: Towards the Development of Intelligent Models of Interaction,2020,"This position paper describes an Agent Interaction Model and framework, i.e. the ability to define interaction roles (e.g. professor, student, parent, child, police, civilian) identified by varying amounts of standardized role features (e.g. Curiosity, Responsibility, Deference, Scientific Knowledge) mapped to physical interaction features (e.g. likelihood of interaction, likelihood of knowledge transfer). The framework can be used to enable exploration of amount, types and patterns of knowledge flow through agent interactions based on agent roles. The hypothesis is that in teams of humans and systems there is a distribution of roles that optimizes knowledge transfer. Empathy, i.e. the ability to change roles quickly based on the needs of others, is hypothesized to be an enabler of improved knowledge flow. The framework allows exploration of these hypotheses. In this paper, the authors report on initial development of the model and their proposed next steps to extend the model and the framework for use in human-agent experiments by mapping the features to user-interface components such as text, voice, gesture, appearance, signs and symbols..",,第3页.xls

The design of a robot football team needs to realize the different standard layers of an autonomous mobile robot (perception, decision, action). It also includes specific artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems problematics. Our study is based on real robots (physical agents). The physical aspect is essential in this work. Indeed, we have to take account of the physical constraints associated to our application. So, the behaviors that we use must be adapted to the technical capacity (the dexterity) of the robots (the precision and the complexity of their actions). Moreover, an experimental platform is developed to validate the theoretical physical agent behaviors. This platform is called MICROB.

131,"Model-based System Engineering for the Assessment of Tactical Performance in the Complex, High Tempo Game of Soccer",2018,"Soccer is an example of an enterprise in which adversarial groups of autonomous agents interact to create competitive advantage in time and space. The interaction is characterized by complex collaborations between the autonomous agents in space and time, coupled with the high tempo occurrence of random events. In this way the events in a game can exceed the cognitive ability of humans to process and analyze team tactical performance to make actionable training and game time adjustments that affect the outcome of the game. This paper describes the application of model-based system engineering to assess tactical performance in the game of soccer. The game is modeled as a probabilistic sequence of random events that occur. The model is the basis for a probabilistic simulation of the game of soccer that can be used to assess the impact of a given team tactic on goals scored in a game. The model, the simulation, and an application of the model are described. The implications of the simulation on coaching and player development and limitations of the model are discussed.",,第3页.xls
132,Implementation techniques for solving POMDPs in personal assistant agents,2006,"Agents or agent teams deployed to assist humans often face the challenges of monitoring the state of key processes in their environment (including the state of their human users themselves) and making periodic decisions based on such monitoring. POMDPs appear well suited to enable agents to address these challenges, given the uncertain environment and cost of actions, but optimal policy generation for POMDPs is computationally expensive. This paper introduces two key implementation techniques (one exact and one approximate) to speedup POMDP policy generation that exploit the notion of progress or dynamics in personal assistant domains and the density of policy vectors. Policy computation is restricted to the belief space polytope that remains reachable given the progress structure of a domain. One is based on applying Lagrangian methods to compute a bounded belief space support in polynomial time and other based on approximating policy vectors in the bounded belief polytope. We illustrate this by enhancing two of the fastest existing algorithms for exact POMDP policy generation. The order of magnitude speedups demonstrate the utility of our implementation techniques in facilitating the deployment of POMDPs within agents assisting human users.",,第3页.xls

However, active distributed networks (ADN) do not always operate in island. In order to consider the power transaction between ADN and the transmission network, the interface agent is proposed. Then a dynamic power response team mechanism is established based on a dynamic multi-agent system. With this mechanism and the source-load-storage coordinative dispatch model for ADN, power fluctuation could be eliminated quickly with the consensus-based algorithm, maintaining the stability of ADN. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism and algorithm in ADN dynamic multi-agent system.",,第3页.xls

But in the design course of an ERP system which is related to a broad range of specialities, and an assembly of capricious members, together with frequently changed system goals, the concept of the CSCW is still not attained enough recognition. As a result, the software in ERP system does not support group-work sufficiently up-to-date.

135,Coordinating teams of autonomous vehicles: An architectural perspective,2005,"In defense-related robotics research, a mission level integration gap exists between mission tasks (tactical) performed by ground, sea, or air applications and elementary behaviors enacted by processing, communications, sensors, and weaponry resources (platform specific). The gap spans ensemble (heterogeneous team) behaviors, automatic MOE/MOP tracking, and tactical task modeling/simulation for virtual and mixed teams comprised of robotic and human combatants. This study surveys robotic system architectures, compares approaches for navigating problem/state spaces by autonomous systems, describes an architecture for an integrated, repository-based modeling, simulation, and execution environment, and outlines a multi-tiered scheme for robotic behavior components that is agent-based, platform-independent, and extendable via plug-ins.

137,The Impact of POMDP-Generated Explanations on Trust and Performance in Human-Robot Teams,2016,"Researchers have observed that people will more accurately trust an autonomous system, such as a robot, if they have a more accurate understanding of its decision-making process. Studies have shown that hand-crafted explanations can help maintain effective team performance even when the system is less than 100% reliable. However, current explanation algorithms are not sufficient for making a robot's quantitative reasoning (in terms of both uncertainty and conflicting goals) transparent to human teammates. In this work, we develop a novel mechanism for robots to automatically generate explanations of reasoning based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems (POMDPs). Within this mechanism, we implement alternate natural-language templates and then measure their differential impact on trust and team performance within an agent-based online testbed that simulates a human-robot team task. The results demonstrate that the added explanation capability leads to improvement in transparency, trust, and team performance. Furthermore, by observing the different outcomes due to variations in the robot's explanation content, we gain valuable insight that can help lead to refinement of explanation algorithms to further improve human-robot interaction.",,第3页.xls

140,Heuristics for multiagent reinforcement learning in decentralized decision problems,2014,"Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) model cooperative multiagent scenarios, providing a powerful general framework for team-based artificial intelligence. While optimal algorithms exist for Dec-POMDPs, theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that they are impractical for many problems of real interest. We examine the use of reinforcement learning (RL) as a means to generate adequate, if not optimal, joint policies for Dec-POMDPs. It is easily demonstrated (and expected) that single-agent RL produces results of little joint utility. We therefore investigate heuristic methods, based upon the dynamics of the Dec-POMDP formulation, that bias the learning process to produce coordinated action. Empirical tests on a benchmark problem show that these heuristics significantly enhance learning performance, even out-performing a hand-crafted heuristic in cases where the learning process converges quickly.",,第3页.xls

142,"The intentions of teams: Team structure, endodeixis, and exodeixis",1998,"Teams arise in a number of important multiagent applications. Several theories of intentions for teams have been proposed. By and large, these theories tend to model team intentions exclusively on the basis of mental concepts, and fail to acknowledge the internal structure of teams.We present a formal theory of intentions for teams that considers the structure of teams explicitly. In this context, we distinguish between exodeictic and endodeictic intentions, which are conceptualized as pointing outward or inward from a team. These concepts are formalized in a framework that models the structure of teams in terms of their members' commitments and coordination requirements. In this way, our approach combines mental and social concepts in a principled manner. We describe some postulates concerning intentions and structure, and give technical results establishing or falsifying these postulates with different definitions.",,第3页.xls
143,Distributed Team Formation in Urban Disaster Environments,2014,"In the disaster management, the agents have to coordinate them to form groups of agents to solve disaster tasks. They must satisfy resource, temporal and communication constraints. In multiagent systems, disaster management can be formalized as a task assignment problem (TAP). In TAP, agents with different capabilities must satisfy constraints to assign values associated with the disaster tasks. In other hand, the tasks must join sets of agents with specific features. From the point of view of the task, the disaster management can be formalized as a partitioning or clustering problem. The agents must to cooperate to solve tasks and to minimize damage. The allocation of tasks to groups of agents is necessary when one single agent cannot perform them efficiently. In this paper, we discuss an algorithm to provide partitions of agents to assign tasks in urban disaster environment. Our algorithm creates partitions of agents in a tree-structure factor graph. The vertices are the agents (variable nodes) or the tasks (factor nodes). We explore the efficiency of a recursive cardinality model, and belief propagation to reduce the communication among the agents. Our empirical evaluations show that, by using our approach, it is possible to create partitions of agents to solve the tasks in less time than a swarm intelligence approach. The agents self organize themselves to represent the priorities over the observed states.",,第3页.xls
144,Simulation Game Concept For AI-Enhanced Teaching Of Advanced Value Stream Analysis And Design,2023,"Value stream analysis and design is employed globally by improvement teams within industrial settings to maximize value creation and eliminate waste. For ending methodical time-centricity, research expanded the methodology to incorporate diverse facets like material flow cost accounting, information logistics, and external influence factors. These enhancements, along with increasing data volumes, are prompting a reevaluation of how professional improvement teams should think and operate. Consequently, a transformation of the pedagogical approach used for educating students and professionals necessitates novel solutions. Conventional teaching methods such as expository lectures are widely considered inadequate in promoting knowledge retention and engagement. So far, existing research has not yet resulted in a solution that can effectively impart the methodological complexity of advanced value stream analysis and design in a motivating and vivid fashion. To address this gap, this paper applies a tailored CRISP gamification framework to develop a simulation game concept. These concept enables AI-enhanced teaching of advanced value stream analysis and design focusing on identification of multi-stage resource-efficient optimization strategies. Through integration of game-based learning with AI a trained reinforcement learning agent can act either competitively or cooperatively, creating a unique form of teaching accounting the aspects personalization, adaptive feedback, content creation, and analysis and assessment.",,第3页.xls

There are various forms of AI-based video interviews with and without the features of tangibility, immediacy, and transparency used for preemployment screening, and these features may distinctively influence applicants' trust in the technology and whether they engage in or disengage from the hiring process accordingly. This field study involved designing a test of the effect of various forms of AI-based video interviews on interviewees' cognitive and affective trust based on the self-reporting of 152 real job applicants. The study found that AI used in asynchronous video interviews (AI-AVI) increased applicants' cognitive trust from that in the non-AI condition. Moreover, when the AI-AVI had features of tangibility and transparency, the applicants' cognitive and affective trust increased. However, the feature of immediacy did not have a statistically significant impact. Contrary to concern over the potential negative effects caused by AI and its features, no statistically significant impacts were found in this study. All rights reserved Elsevier.",,第3页.xls

153,A Logical View on Teamwork,2012,"This chapter presents the non-dynamic part of a formal framework for teamwork in multi-agent systems. The framework consists of botha static part, defining collective motivational attitudes in such a way that the system developer can adapt them to the circumstances, anda dynamic partmonitoring the changes in team attitudes during the course of cooperative problem solving (CPS).In the first part of this chapter, the notion ofcollective intentionin teams of agents is investigated. Starting from individualintentions,goals, andbeliefsdefining agents local attitudes, we arrive at an understanding of collective intention in cooperative teams as a rather strong concept: it implies that all membersintendfor all others to share that intention. This way a team is glued together by collective intention, and exists as long as this attitude holds, after which it may disintegrate.Collective intentions are formalized in a multi-modal logical framework. Together with individual and common knowledge and/or belief, collective intention constitutes a basis for preparing a plan, reflected in the strongest attitude, i.e., incollective commitment, defined and investigated in the next part. Distinct versions of collective commitments that are applicable in various situations, differ with respect to theaspectsof teamwork of which the agents involved are aware, and thekindof awareness present within a team. This way a kind of tuning mechanism is provided for the system developer to tune a version of collective commitment fitting the circumstances. Finally, a few exemplar versions of collective commitment resulting from instantiating the general tuning scheme are presented.",,第3页.xls

156,Decentralized path planning for multi-agent teams with complex constraints,2012,"This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of planning paths for multi-agent systems subject to complex constraints. The technique, called the Decentralized Multi-Agent Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (DMA-RRT) algorithm, extends the Closed-loop RRT (CL-RRT) algorithm to handle multiple agents while retaining its ability to plan quickly. A core component of the DMA-RRT algorithm is a merit-based token passing coordination strategy that makes use of the tree of feasible trajectories grown in the CL-RRT algorithm to dynamically update the order in which agents replan. The reordering is based on a measure of each agent's incentive to change the plan and allows agents with a greater potential improvement to replan sooner, which is demonstrated to improve the team's overall performance compared to a traditional, scripted replan order. The main contribution of the work is a version of the algorithm, called Cooperative DMA-RRT, which introduces a cooperation strategy that allows an agent to modify its teammates' plans in order to select paths that reduce their combined cost. This modification further improves team performance and avoids certain common deadlock scenarios. The paths generated by both algorithms are proven to satisfy inter-agent constraints, such as collision avoidance, and numerous simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate their performance.",,第3页.xls

160,Ontological overhearing,2002,"The collaboration between two intelligent agents can be greatly enhanced if a third agent, who has some understanding of the communication between the first two, intervenes giving appropriate information or acting helpfully without having been explicitly involved. The behavior of this third agent, quite common in human interaction, is called overhearing. We present an agent architecture modeling this behavior. In particular, we focus on overhearing based on ontological reasoning; that is, the overhearer semantically selects pieces of communication according to his own knowledge (ontologically organized) and goals. In our architecture, overhearing is performed by a learn of agents playing two different roles: the first role (overhearer) classifies the overheard communication according to a formal ontology; the second role (suggester) makes appropriate suggestions at the appropriate time point. We present a formal language for the interaction between agents in the overhearing team. A prototype of the architecture, implemented using JACK Intelligent Agents, is briefly described and preliminary experimental results are discussed.",,第3页.xls

The collaborative design process gets more complex when a group of geographically dispersed designers work as a team. In this paper, we take a group decision-based approach to model design process and introduce an agent-based architecture to support collaborative design. The proposed architecture achieves the design decisions integration between design members in a dynamic design environment. In particular, the proposed agents can provide the interaction spaces for coordinating the individual design decisions. Finally, the mechanism of coordination between agents is discussed.",,第3页.xls

Robot soccer is a part of standard applications of distributed system control in real time. The software part of a distributed control system is realized by decision making and executive agents. The algorithm of agents' cooperation was proposed with the control agent on a higher level. The algorithms for agents realized in robots are the same. Real-time dynamic simple strategy description and strategy learning possibility based on game observation is important for discovering opponents strategies and searching for tactical group movements, simulation and synthesis of suitable counter-strategies.

A challenge is how to deliver messages in such networks incurring least routing overhead. Cooperative routing is a mobile-agent assisted team approach, which utilizes a set of fixed cluster head nodes to provide proper coordination and cooperation for exchanges and sharing of messages in the team. Our routing strategy aims at reducing routing overheads, message traffic and unnecessary random node visits in the network for delivering data. The main benefit provided by cooperative routing is considerable network traffic reduction at high load. We highlight the main components of the system and discuss the agent life cycle in detail together with the parameters and strategies governing the migration of agents, their merging and termination.",,第3页.xls
166,Optimizing proportional reward in the multi agent RL system,2006,"Reinforcement teaming methods which have been applied for Multi Agent Systems (MAS), usually originates form single agent system. So they determine a reward for transition from one state to another state and affect the reward to the Q of all actions equivalently. Assigning one reward to all actions of an state transition, cause favorable action would be confirmed as same as unfavorable actions, so the teaming period will be lengthened.In this paper first we review a new method proposed by the authors for Multi Agent System, which assigns a fraction of rewards to action in proportion to the Q of each action and so it is called rewarding proportional to Q or RPQ. There are some parameters affect on the RPQ optimization, which is discussed in this paper. Simulation is used to show how RPQ teaming speed and final outcome are changed according to algorithm parameters.",,第3页.xls
167,Self-enforcing agreement in cooperative teams: an agent-based modeling approach,2016,"Purpose: In cooperative teams (such as agricultural cooperatives), self-enforcing agreement plays a critical role in guaranteeing memberswork incentives when the monitoring from a third party is absent. In order to provide an effective sanction to the violators so as to maintain the agreement, two seemingly conflicting strategies are proposed. One is allowing the members to exit the team freely. The other is imposing a high exit cost to restrict members from leaving the team. The arguments behind each strategy are elaborated in Lin (J Comp Econ 17:504-20, 1993) and Dong and Dow (J Comp Econ 17:472-84, 1993), respectively. However, these strategies have never been tested in the same model. In fact, no formal model is presented for one of the arguments. To fill this gap, we develop a model that incorporates the two arguments as two scenarios in a shared framework. Methods: An agent-based model is developed to test the two competing hypotheses in the theory of self-enforcing agreement. The model takes heterogeneity of team members (e.g., their laziness, work ability and patience to future well-being) into consideration, which allows us to better understand the divergence of these two arguments. Results: Using the agent-based model, we conduct computational experiments for testing the two hypotheses. Estimation on the experiment outputs show that (1) The sustained discount rate is lower in exit-free cooperative teams than exit-restricted ones when shirking members exist, which confirms the argument of Lin (J Comp Econ 17:504-20, 1993), and (2) The sustained discount rate is lower in exit-restricted teams than exit-free ones when membersleisure preferences are not too diverse and the economics of scale are not too large, or when the sizes of the teams are large enough, which verifies the argument of Dong and Dow (J Comp Econ 17:472-84, 1993). Conclusion: We find the two arguments essentially claim different consequences under different conditions of memberscharacteristics and team size. Our study demonstrates agent-based simulation can be an effective approach of testing game theoretical arguments and exploring game theoretical ideas.",,第3页.xls

A set of experiments is given to prove the efficiency of the analysis. The advantages and the limitations of the proposed approach are also discussed.",,第3页.xls
171,Agent-based integration of rescue systems for first responders,2012,"Routine operations of emergency first responders are usually well managed. The situation is different for mass casualty emergencies where more people and properties are threatened. In such situations there are no predefined plans in place and mitigation is solved mostly through crisis management. Teams managing such acute accidents are often working in information insufficiency. Timely information exchange between involved agencies, common understanding of data and fast provision of knowledge can save lives and protect properties. Useful information is heterogeneous and is distributed across many organizations in disparate information sources in many formats with different access policies and in varying quality. The information sources range from sensors deployed on incidence sites, publicly available data sources, corporate legacy systems, documents stored on remote locations to human end-users providing information using mobile devices. This article addresses operational challenges of First Responders and complementary challenges in accessing and analyzing information from multiple sources to provide advanced capabilities for command and control in emergency response. Herein we propose to use an agent-based infrastructure for supporting such interoperability. We propose to build the framework amplifying an agent infrastructure developed in scope of the SECRICOM EU integrated project. In this article we focus mainly on the conceptual architecture of such integration framework.",,第3页.xls
172,"AEGONE - Agent-enabled, grid-oriented, and just-in-time network of experts",2006,"Consider a model developed by a multidisciplinary team of scientists. This model will be used by researchers to support some scientific investigation. However, this investigation might be hampered if the researcher needs to interface (on the fly) with the members of the inter-disciplinary team responsible for the development of the model. The situation becomes more complicated if the following occurs: (a) multiple distributed models are needed for the researcher's scientific endeavor and (b) a similar need for interaction with the model-development teams arises. (As an example, consider a weather researcher who needs access to multiple weather models from different localities and each model reflects the contributions of several experts in air currents, air pressure, temperature, etc.)This paper presents an innovative integrated solution to the two problems identified above (i.e., access to multidisciplinary team members responsible for model development and access to multiple distributed models and other data/information resources in a user-friendly transparent way) with the introduction of Agent-Enabled, Grid-Oriented Network of Expert agents (AEGONE). AEGONE is a system under development to give researchers just-in-time access to expert domain knowledge. This system will enable them to conduct scientific investigations and transparent access to distributed models and other resources without the immediate need to interface with human experts or knowledge of the complexity of the underlying grid-oriented and agent-mediated infrastructures.(12)AEGONE extends the capabilities of current grid-oriented computing systems and DARPA's Coalition Agents eXperiments (CoAX).",,第3页.xls

The server used in the simulation league has problems of scaling up. Further it, requires considerable effort to understand the server code to make any additional changes. Therefore, it is difficult for newcomers to quickly enhance the server. The architecture and the functional desin of die current server are excellent. This helps us provide a database driven architecture that can scale up the current server to 10-15 times the number of agents that can be simulated.

At present the studies are mainly centered on single agent learning problems. In our case, we use simulated soccer to investigate multi-agent cooperative learning. Considering the fundamental differences in learning mechanism, existing reinforcement learning algorithms can be roughly classified into two classes: one based on evaluation functions and one searching through policy space directly. Genetic programming developed from genetic algorithms is one of the most well known approaches that belong to the latter class. The authors present a detailed algorithm as well as a data construction description that are necessary for learning single agent strategies. They go on to extend the developed methods into multiple robot domains. They investigate and contrast three different solutions: single agent learning, simple team learning and sub-group learning, and conclude the article with some actual experiments and results analyses.",,第3页.xls
175,"On social commitment, roles and preferred goals",1998,"We present a framework for modelling various types of influences on an agent's prioritising of its goals, with emphasis on obligations arising from the agent's roles in designated relationships. The framework is based on work of Bell and Huang on goal hierarchies and intention revision, and incorporates notions related to social goal adoption and social commitment as discussed by Castelfranchi. We use roles as an abstraction to enable the agent designer to scope the sphere of influence of one agent with respect to another. Roles then provide a way to specify how the agent should balance competing obligations from different relationships, and from tensions between personal preferences and social obligations. This approach seems to integrate well with the use of team plans for implementing collaborative behaviour.",,第3页.xls

177,Development and Specification of a Reference Model for Agent-Based Systems,2009,"Agent-based systems have been the object of intense research over the past decade. While great theoretical progress has been made, the software frameworks for creating agent-based systems offer considerable variability in their capabilities and functionality. This paper introduces a reference model for agent-based systems. The purpose of a reference model is to provide a common conceptual basis for comparing systems and driving the development of software architectures and other standards. The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents and other groups have advanced a number of agent standards, yet, to date, no comprehensive reference model has been presented for software systems composed of agents. This paper provides an overview of a reference model for agent-based systems. The agent systems reference model is the result of a multiyear effort studying software systems built with agents and software frameworks for implementing these systems. As part of this study, the team applied software reverse engineering techniques to perform static and dynamic analysis of operational agent-based systems. This analysis enabled identification of key common concepts across over one dozen different agent frameworks. To demonstrate its applicability, the reference model is then used to analyze a number of complete agent-based software systems. It is the belief of the authors that the reference model will be an essential prerequisite for future transition, deployment, and integration of agent-based systems.",,第3页.xls
178,Multiagent approach to solve project team work allocation problems,2009,"In today's fiercely competitive market, embedded software development teams are driven to do more with less: reduce time to market, costs and risk, while improving quality and predictability. There is also an increasing need to deliberately organise the teams that initially involves the division of the project into tasks; the selection of the right people; and the correct allocation of those tasks for the selected people. Team configuration process is typically performed by a project manager based on his/her past experience and the available (though frequently scarce, uncertain and dynamic) information about the cognitive, emotion and social characteristics of the potential team members. To support this decision-making process we propose the Fuzzy Belief-Desire-Intention architecture, a multiagent approach that given an initial team configuration and a set of tasks, simulates the most possible team performance. Its architecture bases are fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic and it is implemented using Multiagent Systems technology in Java and Jadex. Tests have been carried out in which the architecture has been applied to a set of tasks involving the embedded software development. The result predicted by our architecture with the performance of an engineering team in a real industrial project is made.",,第3页.xls

180,Distributed Allocation of Mobile Sensing Agents in Geophysical Flows,2014,"We address the synthesis of distributed control policies to enable a homogeneous team of mobile sensing agents to maintain a desired spatial distribution in a geophysical flow environment. Geophysical flows are natural large-scale fluidic environments such as oceans, eddies, jets, and rivers. In this work, we assume the agents have a map of the fluidic environment consisting of the locations of the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). LCS are time-dependent structures that divide the flow into dynamically distinct regions, and are time-dependent extensions of stable and unstable manifolds. Using this information, we design agent-level hybrid control policies that leverage the surrounding fluid dynamics and inherent environmental noise to enable the team to maintain a desired distribution in the workspace. We validate the proposed control strategy using flow fields given by: 1) an analytical time-varying wind-driven multi-gyre flow model, 2) actual flow data generated using our coherent structure experimental testbed, and 3) ocean data provided by the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) database.",,第3页.xls

182,Model-Based Diagnosis of Multi-Agent Systems: A Survey,2022,"As systems involving multiple agents are increasingly deployed, there is a growing need to diagnose failures in such systems. Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) is a well known AI technique to diagnose faults in systems. In this approach, a model of the diagnosed system is given, and the real system is observed. A failure is announced when the real system's output contradicts the model's expected output. The model then is used to deduce the defective components that explain the unexpected observation. MBD has been increasingly being deployed in distributed and multi-agent systems. In this survey, we summarize twenty years of research in the field of model-based diagnosis algorithms for MAS diagnosis. We depict three attributes that should be considered when examining MAS diagnosis: (1) The objective of the diagnosis. Either diagnosing faults in the MAS plans or diagnosing coordination faults. (2) Centralized vs. distributed. The diagnosis method could be applied either by a centralized agent or by the agents in a distributed manner. (3) Temporal vs. non temporal. Temporal diagnosis is used to diagnose the MAS's temporal behaviors, whereas non-temporal diagnosis is used to diagnose the conduct based on a single observation. We survey diverse studies in MBD of MAS based on these attributes, and provide novel research challenges in this field for the AI community.",,第3页.xls
183,DynaInteg:: Meta-ontology supporting dynamic knowledge sharing and acquisition for multi-agent cooperation,2000,"Cooperation is one of the central components in most multi-agent systems. This paper introduces a cooperation protocol through knowledge sharing among intelligent agents by using meta-ontology DynaInteg. DynaInteg permits agents to acquire any other common ontologies which are used by other team members in a multi-agent enviromnent. So DynaInteg provides the functionality for each agent to build or extend its common ontology to achieve dynamic knowledge sharing. Such a protocol enables agents to cooperate for problem solving in dynamic multi-agent environments. In this paper, the methodology of dynamic knowledge sharing and acquisition in DynaInteg is introduced, and knowledge representation of DynaInteg is described. Furthermore, the implementation issues of DynaInteg are also discussed in detail.",,第3页.xls
184,Adaptive agent integration architectures for heterogeneous team members,2000,"With the proliferation of software agents and smart hardware devices there is a growing realization that large-scale problems call be addressed by integration of such stand-alone systems. This has led to an increasing interest in integration architectures that enable a heterogeneous variety of agents and humans to work together These agents and humans differ in their capabilities, preferences, the level of autonomy they are willing to grant the integration architecture and their information requirements and performance. The challenge in coordinating such a diverse agent set is that potentially a large number of domain-specific and agent-specific coordination plans may be required. We present a novel two-tiered approach to address this coordination problem. We first provide the integration architecture with general purpose teamwork coordination capabilities, but then enable adaptation of such capabilities for the needs or requirements of specific individuals. A key novel aspect of this adaptation is that it takes place in the context of other heterogeneous team members. We are realizing this approach in an implemented distributed agent integration architecture called Teamcore. Experimental results from two different domains are presented.",,第3页.xls
185,Investigating the evolving context of an unstable approach in aviation from mental model disconnects with an agent-based model,2020,"Unstable approach is an adverse aviation event, and it is strongly related to the interaction between pilots and air traffic controllers (ATCOs). Mental model disconnects among team members can be a major cause of possible interaction conflicts and defective team cognition. Therefore, to study the negative effects of various mental model disconnects, a framework of evolving team cognition (FETC) is proposed to examine the evolving context of an accident. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed to simulate how mental model disconnects are involved in evolving landing scenarios. The results of a simulation conducted with the ABM indicate that mental model disconnects occur more frequently as an aircraft approaches the terminal area. For landing scenarios in the outer area between 100 and 50 nautical miles (Nm), task-related mental model disconnects occur more frequently, causing incompatibility between parties. The incompatibility reveals the necessity of extra coordination to prevent the potential occurrence of system errors. As for the scenarios around the terminal area (30-15 Nm), the team-related mental model disconnects prevail, leading to passive information dissemination regarding changing conditions and late initiation of urgent coordination. The combination of these factors causes a team to miss the window for preventing an adverse event.",,第3页.xls
186,Build a Soccer Server team with an environmental-agents,2002,"Much attention is paid to RoboCup tournament development in recent years. Many researchers are involved in designing and manufacturing the new type robots to win the game. As the simulator league of RoboCup tournament, the Soccer Server system is a typical multi-agent system. In general, there are three kinds of agent architectures: deliberation, reactive agent and hybrid architecture. Many conventional object-oriented models suffer problems in the representation of multiple objects. A multiple object is an object with multiple aspects, autonomy, and pro-activeness. This paper proposes a new agent model, which applies the agent-oriented paradigm to represent multiple objects. This agent model consists of three types of agents as follows: (a) an upper-agent which describes an autonomous and dynamic object; (b) a lower-agent which describes a reactive and static object; and (c) an environmental-agent which describes the environment of the other agents. As an example, we model soccer players (a kind of multiple objects) in environmental-agent. Three kinds of soccer agents are constructed with different powers. With soccer server we simulate the soccer games to confirm the effectiveness of our model.",,第3页.xls

Data mining modules capable of online learning in dynamically changing environment are suggested. These modules provide for adaptive agent behavior in the form of the cognitive control systems that are able to self-tune in non-deterministic environment. Reinforcement learning is considered as the basic method for forming an agent behavior. A cognitive soccer agent for RoboCup Simulation League competitions capable of on-line learning has been developed and studied. Examples of shooting and teamwork are considered.

188,(When) Can AI Bots Lie?,2019,"The ability of an AI agent to build mental models can open up pathways for manipulating and exploiting the human in the hopes of achieving some greater good. In fact, such behavior does not necessarily require any malicious intent but can rather be borne out of cooperative scenarios. It is also beyond the scope of misinterpretation of intents, as in the case of value alignment problems, and thus can be effectively engineered if desired (i.e. algorithms exist that can optimize such behavior not because models were misspecified but because they were misused). Such techniques pose several unresolved ethical and moral questions with regards to the design of autonomy. In this paper, we illustrate some of these issues in a teaming scenario and investigate how they are perceived by participants in a thought experiment. Finally, we end with a discussion on the moral implications of such behavior from the perspective of the doctor-patient relationship.",,第3页.xls

Our interest in this area is motivated in part by our involvement in a Navy-sponsored micro air vehicle (MAV) project in which the goal is to solve difficult surveillance tasks using a large team of small inexpensive autonomous air vehicles rather than a few expensive piloted vehicles. Our approach to developing control programs for these MAVs is to use evolutionary computation techniques to evolve behavioral rule sets.

Support for synchronous collaboration is well researched and developed. However, for asynchronous collaboration systems, the research is very limited. The purpose of this study is to identify the major factors that affect the efficiency of engineering collaboration over the Internet using CAD browsers and design-agent-based features to support engineering collaboration. Activity coordination, collaboration awareness, and communication support were identified as the major factors for efficient engineering collaboration using CAD browsers. The agent-based features of Comment Status, Communication Agent, Team Member Information Enhancement, and Task Information Enhancement were designed to support communication, activity coordination, and collaboration awareness issues for engineering collaboration. A prototype of the CAD browser was designed. Three experiments were conducted to test the efficiency of the new proposed features in the agent system. The experimental results indicate that (a) the Comment Status feature reduced the missing rates of comments and comment processing time, (b) the Communication Agent reduced delay time in processing comments, and (c) the features of Team Member Information and Task Information Enhancement improved collaboration efficiency and subject satisfaction.",,第3页.xls
191,Intra-role coordination using group communication: A preliminary report,2003,"We propose group communication for agent coordination within active rooms and other pervasive computing scenarios featuring strict real-time requirements, inherently unreliable communication, and a large but continuously changing set of context-aware autonomous systems. Messages are exchanged over multicast channels, which may remind of chat rooms in which everybody hears everything being said. The issues that have to be faced (e.g., changing users' preferences and locations; performance constraints; redundancies of sensors and actuators; agents on mobile devices continuously joining and leaving) require the ability of dynamically selecting the best agents for providing a service in a given context. Our approach is based on the idea of implicit organization, which refers to the set of all agents willing to play a given role on a given channel. An implicit organization is a special form of team with no explicit formation phase and a single role involved. No middle agent is required. A set of protocols, designed for unreliable group communication, are used to negotiate a coordination policy, and for team coordination. Preconditions and effects of these protocols are formalized by means of the joint intention theory (JIT).",,第3页.xls
192,Multi-Agent Coordination for a Partially Observable and Dynamic Robot Soccer Environment with Limited Communication [arXiv],2024,"RoboCup represents an International testbed for advancing research in AI and robotics, focusing on a definite goal: developing a robot team that can win against the human world soccer champion team by the year 2050. To achieve this goal, autonomous humanoid robots' coordination is crucial. This paper explores novel solutions within the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL), where a reduction in WiFi communication is imperative, leading to the development of new coordination paradigms. The SPL has experienced a substantial decrease in network packet rate, compelling the need for advanced coordination architectures to maintain optimal team functionality in dynamic environments. Inspired by market-based task assignment, we introduce a novel distributed coordination system to orchestrate autonomous robots' actions efficiently in low communication scenarios. This approach has been tested with NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions and in the SimRobot simulator, demonstrating a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited communication settings.",,第3页.xls
193,Robot mirroring: A framework for self-tracking feedback through empathy with an artificial agent representing the self [arXiv],2019,"Current technologies have enabled us to track and quantify our physical state and behavior. Self-tracking aims to achieve increased awareness to decrease undesired behaviors and lead to a healthier lifestyle. However, inappropriately communicated self-tracking results might cause the opposite effect. In this work, we propose a subtle self-tracking feedback by mirroring the self's state into an artificial agent. By eliciting empathy towards the artificial agent and fostering helping behaviors, users would help themselves as well. Finally, we reflected on the implications of this design framework, and the methodology to design and implement it. A series of interviews to expert designers pointed out to the importance of having multidisciplinary teams working in parallel. Moreover, an agile methodology with a sprint zero for the initial design, and shifted user research, design, and implementation sprints were proposed. Similar systems with data flow and hardware dependencies would also benefit from the proposed agile design process.",,第3页.xls

Understanding the formation of task-oriented groups is an important first step to study the dynamics of team collaboration. In this paper, we investigated group combat activities in Sonys EverQuest II game to identify the role of player and group attributes on group formation. We found that group formation is highly influenced by players common interests on challenging tasks. Players with less combat experience are more likely to participate in group events for difficult tasks and team performance is positively correlated to group size.",,第3页.xls
195,Generating Executable Code from High-Level Social or Socio-Ecological Model Descriptions,2019,"Agent-Based Modelling has been used for social simulation because of the several benefits it entails. Social models are often constructed by inter-disciplinary teams that include subject-matter experts with no programming skills. These experts are typically involved in the creation of the conceptual model, but not the verification or validation of the simulation model. The Overview, Design concepts, and Details (ODD) protocol has emerged as a way of presenting a model at a high level of abstraction and as an effort towards improving the reproducibility of Agent-Based Models (ABMs) but it is typically written after a model has been completed. This paper reverses the process and provides non-programming experts with a user-friendly and extensible tool called ODD2ABM for creating and altering models on their own. This is done by formalizing ODD using concepts abstracted from the NetLogo language, enabling users to generate NetLogo code from an ODD description automatically. We verified the ODD2ABM tool with three existing NetLogo models.",,第3页.xls
196,Abstract world for opportunistic local decisions in multi-agent systems,2003,"Collaboration of multiple intelligent agents on a shared task is a complex research issue, made particularly difficult when communication is limited or impossible. A common solution in multi-agent systems is to commit a team of collaborating agents to a joint plan. Since any deviation from the plan by an agent is hazardous, the common treatment of potential unplanned opportunities is either by ignoring them (even when opportunistic actions increase the expected utility of the team), or by ad-hoc rules determining whether to accept such opportunities. Neither of these solutions is desirable.dIn our framework, Abstract World for Opportunistic Local decisions - AWOL for short(1), we attempt a disciplined treatment of opportunistic actions, in the context of an existing joint plan. The idea is to model the (stochastic) tradeoff of such opportunistic actions vs. continued commitment to the joint plan, while abstracting away as much as possible from the state of the world. The abstract model is evaluated using strict decision-theo re tic criteria, with the goal of applying the optimal decision on whether to accept an opportunistic action in the original domain.",,第3页.xls
197,Improved bounds for optimal black hole search with a network map,2004,"A black hole is a harmful host that destroys incoming agents without leaving any observable trace of such a destruction. The black hole search problem is to unambiguously determine the location of the black hole. A team of agents, provided with a network map and executing the same protocol, solves the problem if at least one agent survives and, within finite time, knows the location of the black hole.It is known that a team must have at least two agents. Interestingly, two agents with a map of the network can locate the black hole with O(n) moves in many highly regular networks; however the protocols used apply only to a narrow class of networks. On the other hand, any universal solution protocol must use R(n log n) moves in the worst case, regardless of the size of the team.A universal solution protocol has been recently presented that uses a team of just two agents with a map of the network, and locates a black hole in at most 0(n log n) moves. Thus, this protocol has both optimal size and worst-case-optimal cost. We show that this result, far from closing the research quest, can be significantly improved.In this paper we present a universal protocol that allows a team of two agents with a network map to locate the black hole using at most O(n+d log d) moves, where d is the diameter of the network. This means that, without losing its universality and without violating the worst-case Omega(n log n) lower bound, this algorithm allows two agents to locate a black hole with 09(n) cost in a very large class of (possibly unstructured) networks.",,第3页.xls
198,A Personal Medical Digital Assistant Agent for Supporting Human Operators in Emergency Scenarios,2017,"In this paper we present Trauma Tracker, a project - in cooperation with the Trauma Center of a hospital in Italy - in which agent technologies are exploited to realise Personal Medical Digital Assistant Agents (PMDA) supporting a Trauma Team in trauma management operations. This project aims at exploring the fruitful integration of software personal agents with wearable/eyewear computing, based on mobile and wearable devices such as smart-glasses. The key functionality of Trauma Tracker is to keep track of relevant events occurring during the management of a trauma, for different purposes. The basic one - discussed in detail in this paper - is to have an accurate documentation of the trauma, to automate the creation (and management) of reports and to enable offline data analysis, useful for performance evaluation and to improve the work of the Trauma Team. Then, tracking is essential to conceive more involved assisting functionalities by the PMDA, from monitoring and warning generation to suggesting actions to performfully exploiting the hands-free interface of wearable technologies. This goes towards the idea - envisioned in the paper - ofaugmented physiciansworking inaugmented hospitals, in which software personal agents are exploited along with enabling technologies from wearable and pervasive computing, augmented reality, to create novel smart environments to support individual and cooperative work of healthcare professionals.",,第3页.xls
199,Emergent learning behaviour in a simulated organization faced with tasks requiring team effort,2006,"We conceptualize organizational learning as a result of the collective learning behaviour of knowledge agents in an organization. Each agent provides a range of attributes that may be required to perform organizational tasks. We devised a computational model consisting of three processes to simulate an organization's response to performing repeated tasks: (1) Expert Selection Process for selecting the winner knowledge agent or lead agent; (2) Plan Formation Process for deciding what additional attributes are needed, but not possessed by the winner expert agent, and iteratively selecting further agents with the needed attributes until the task can be accomplished by the combined attributes of the 'coalition of agents' so formed; and (3) Capital Modification Process for rewarding participating agents according to the success of their combined organizational performance. We observed the simulated results for different combinations of three levels of task difficulty (requiring, respectively, 5, 10 and, 15 different attributes, each at a sufficient level in the coalition or team to complete the task), and three levels of selection, during plan formation, for knowledge agent performance (the extent to which selection favours knowledge agents with much capital or large strength versus knowledge agents without much capital or large strength). The simulated organization exhibited aspects of both single loop and double loop learning, in repeatedly performing the same task, and 'learning to perform the task' with the smallest possible team.",,第3页.xls
200,The Virtual Design Team (VDT): A multi-agent analysis framework for designing project organizations,2003,"The Virtual Design Team (VDT) is a multi-agent modeling and simulation framework that has been developed over the past 15 years to help project managers design work processes and organizations for highly concurrent, fast-track project work. VDT has been extensively validated as an analysis tool for project organizations engaged in a routine-albeit complex and fast-track-product development efforts. Three important limitations of VDT are (1) it models only routine projects for which all tasks, agents, and relationships between and among them can he prespecified and held constant; (2) it assumes that all exceptions are handled hierarchically; and (3) it ignores any goal incongruency among project participants. This paper describes VDT, highlights its limitations, and presents ongoing research that is attempting to address these limitations.",,第3页.xls
201,An agent model for NL dialog interfaces,1998,"Agent theories take as their paradigm human intentional behavior; however, as far as agent interaction is concerned, they have not yet satisfactorily taken into account the requirements raised by studies on human Natural Language communication, the most developed means of interaction. The fundamental missing point is the role of intention recognition, which is the basis of human dialog interactions. In this paper, we describe a declarative agent architecture for modeling social agent behavior, with particular attention to Natural Language dialog. The architecture can be used both to recognize a speaker's intentions and generate intention-driven behavior in agent interactions; therefore, it is suited to interface agents for HCI, which require a friendly interaction with users.",,第3页.xls

The architecture was designed regarding the needs of hardware-based multi-agent systems, especially robotic systems. This includes in particular fast and reliable transportation of messages in unstable wireless networks. Furthermore the architecture is usable for different agent-based software systems and allows communication between different systems even if they have a complete different representation of internal data. The architecture was evaluated in the RoboCup scenario with a multi-agent system of 5 robots interacting in a highly dynamic environment.

204,Exploring an unknown dangerous graph using tokens,2013,"Consider a team of (one or more) mobile agents operating in a graph G. Unaware of the graph topology and starting from the same node, the team must explore the graph. This problem, known as graph exploration, was initially formulated by Shannon in 1951, and has been extensively studied since under a variety of conditions. Most of the existing investigations have assumed that the network is safe for the agents, and the vast majority of the solutions presented in the literature succeed in their task only under this assumption.Recently, the exploration problem has been examined also when the network is unsafe. The danger examined is the presence in the network of a black hole, a node that disposes of any incoming agent without leaving any observable trace of this destruction. The goal is for at least one agent to survive and to have all the surviving agents to construct a map of the network, indicating the edges leading to the black hole. This variant of the problem is also known as a black hole search. This problem has been investigated for the most part assuming powerful inter-agent communication mechanisms: whiteboards at all nodes. Indeed, in this model, the black hole search problem can be solved with an optimal team size and performing a polynomial number of moves.In this paper, we consider the less powerful enhanced token model: each agent has available a token that can be carried, placed on a node or on a link, and can be removed from it. All tokens are identical and no other form of marking or communication is available. We constructively prove that the black hole search problem can be solved also in this model; furthermore, this can be done using a team of agents of optimal size and performing a polynomial number of moves. Our algorithm works even if the agents are asynchronous and if both the agents and the nodes are anonymous. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls

In such teams, trust is essential since people rely on each others. We propose a decision making system for agents in CVET based on an agent model inspired from works on trust in organizational psychology. Agents dimensions are integrity, benevolence and abilities, and agents have trust-beliefs about their teammates integrity, benevolence and abilities. Based on their personal dimensions and trust beliefs, agents compute the importance of their goals and then the utility of actions to select the most appropriate action.",,第3页.xls

207,Layered disclosure: revealing agents' internals,2001,"A perennial challenge in creating and using complex autonomous agents is following their choices of actions as the world changes dynamically and understanding why they act as they do. The paper reports on our work to support human developers and observers to better follow and understand the actions of autonomous agents. We introduce the concept of layered disclosure by which autonomous agents have included in their architecture the foundations necessary to allow them to disclose upon request the specific reasons for their actions. Layered disclosure hence goes beyond standard plain code debugging tools. In its essence it also gives the agent designer the ability to define an appropriate information hierarchy, which can include agent-specific constructs such as internal state that persists over time. The user may request this information at any of the specified levels of detail, and either retroactively or while the agent is acting. We present layered disclosure as we created and implemented it in the simulated robotic soccer domain. We contribute the detailed design to support the application of layered disclosure to other agent domains. Layered disclosure played an important role in our successful development of the undefeated RoboCup champion CMUnited-99 multiagent team.",,第3页.xls

209,Spatial agents implemented in a logical expressible language,2000,"In this paper, we present a multi-layered architecture for spatial agents. The focus is laid on the declarativity of the approach, which makes agent scripts expressive and well understandable. They can be realized as (constraint) logic programs. The logical description language is able to express actions or plans for one and more autonomous and cooperating agents for the RoboCup (Simulator League). The system architecture hosts constraint technology for qualitative spatial reasoning, but quantitative data is taken into account, too. The basic (hardware) layer processes the agent's sensor information. An interface transfers this low-level data into a logical representation. It provides facilities to access the preprocessed data and supplies several basic skills. The second layer performs (qualitative) spatial reasoning. On top of this, the third layer enables more complex skills such as passing, offside-detection etc. At last, the fourth layer establishes acting as a team both by emergent and explicit cooperation. Lo-ic and deduction provide a clean means to specify and also to implement teamwork behavior.",,第3页.xls

We have chosen soccer as one of standard problems for the study on multi-agent systems, and we are now developing a soccer server, which provides a common test-bench to various multi-agent systems.

211,Understanding Is a Process,2022,"How do we gauge understanding? Tests of understanding, such as Turing's imitation game, are numerous; yet, attempts to achieve a state of understanding are not satisfactory assessments. Intelligent agents designed to pass one test of understanding often fall short of others. Rather than approaching understanding as a system state, in this paper, we argue that understanding is a process that changes over time and experience. The only window into the process is through the lens of natural language. Usefully, failures of understanding reveal breakdowns in the process. We propose a set of natural language-based probes that can be used to map the degree of understanding a human or intelligent system has achieved through combinations of successes and failures.",,第3页.xls
212,Experimental analysis of self-organizing team's behaviors,2010,"This paper is focused on the study of self-organizing team's behaviors which are dependent on the interaction rules and the decision factors of team members. The self-organizing team's behavior means that team members work unconditionally with one of the three work attitudes (diligence, average, and shirking). A small-world network is suggested as the basic relationships of team members. Different from the traditional models, Reciprocators encourage their friends if they work diligently and punish them if they shirk work. it is supposed that team member's decision of choosing work attitude depends on four decision factors, humanity, herd instinct, rationality, and follower tendency. Firstly, all of the four decision factors' weights are supposed as 0.25. Multiple experiments were conducted to analyze the behavior of a team by a multi-agent experiment system. It is found that, in order to increase the fraction of diligent team members, different strategies should be used under different Reciprocators' fractions. Increasing Reciprocators' fraction is beneficial to the increase of diligent members; however. the increase rate will slow down after an inflexion (here it means the inflexion of Reciprocators' fraction). After the previous experiments study, extended experiments were developed to work on the influence of the four factors' different weights. A self-adaptive algorithm is Suggested to achieve the four decision factors' weights. The results of self-adaptive algorithm have different influences on the team's behaviors under different fractions of Reciprocators. Finally, influences of members' different relationships are studied by other experiments. It is also proved that the fraction of diligent members is not dependent on the structure of team members' relationships. The results demonstrate that the self-organizing team's behavior can be significantly influenced by its scenario while managing a self-organizing team. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

213,"The RETSINA multiagent system: towards integrating planning, execution and information gathering",1998,"This presentation describes the RETSINA (Reusable Task Structure Based Intelligent Network Agents) framework, explicates the unifying organizational and architectural ideas and demonstrates their applicability to various dynamic domains (e.g. financial portfolio management, distributed calendar scheduling, satellite visibility tracking). The architecture of a single agent as well as the coordination strategies that the agents use are presented in some detail. RETSINA is a flexible framework that enables agents to dynamically form agent teams on-demand to solve a problem, taking into consideration and adapting to the user, task and situation. For example, RETSINA agents monitor sources of stock information, financial news, historical data, EDGAR data (EDGAR is the database that keeps annual and quarterly company earnings reports) and notify the user of relevant changes. In addition, the agents collaborate to integrate data from these different sources. Moreover, they provide advice to the user regarding prospective stocks and act on a user's behalf performing stock buying and selling transactions. The RETSINA group believes that the next generation of agent technology will heavily rely on multiple adaptive coordinating agents that support users not only in gathering information but also in making decisions, thus providing advantages far beyond conventional agent technology. This paper presents the lessons learned in a wide variety of domains.",,第3页.xls

215,Information fusion in a cooperative multi-agent system for web information retrieval,2002,"As an attempt to solve some contemporary web information retrieval problems, a construction of a cooperative multiagent system is proposed. This paper introduces the system and presents the use of a unique aggregation and fusion technique that is employed to attain reliable delivery performance. The intelligent methodology to fuse agents' decisions, the team consensus approach, models the interaction and bring a society into a consensus. After each agent in the group gathers information relevant to a user's query, the group engages in an uncertainty estimation stage. This process allows each agent to assess its self-uncertainty and the conditional uncertainties of other agents. The procedure facilitates the computation of a weighting scheme that operates recursively on information collected by these agents until the group reaches a consensus. Whenever a new task is received, the uncertainty estimates of agents are updated and used to compute a new weighting scheme.",,第3页.xls
216,Sporadic pairwise synchronization for decentralized decision-making in mobile agent teams,2006,"This paper focuses on the problem of cooperative search and task response in a heterogeneous team of autonomous mobile agents with limited communication. The agents are engaged in a mission to search for targets, to verify their existence, and to take appropriate action for each verified target in an uncertain environment. Each agent makes its decisions based on a subjective information base (SIB), constructed through observation and communication with other agents. Communication between agents is of two types: type I) Each agent periodically broadcasts recently obtained or generated information over a limited radius; and type II) When two agents come sufficiently close, they exchange and merge their entire SIBs. Type I communication results in the diffusion of information among all the agents, and is, in principle, sufficient for decision-making. However, for a fixed population of agents with specified dynamics, this places a lower limit on the range and frequency of broadcast. We hypothesize that including a small amount of type II communication allows for significant decrease in these limits, and leads to a more efficient system. This hybrid approach represents a general communication strategy for multi-agent systems.",,第3页.xls

219,Knowledge-based distributed search using teamwork,1995,"We present a knowledge-based distribution concept for search problems that offer no natural way for several agents to cooperate in finding a solution. Systems based on our teamwork method use four types of agents: experts and specialists use heuristics to generate results that are possible parts of solutions, referees judge the experts and their results determining the most promising ones and a supervisor collects these promising results to generate new problem descriptions that converge to a solution of the initial problem. The main difficulty of distributed systems, the communication overhead, is dealt with by restricting the work of referees and the supervisor to short so-called team meetings that interrupt the work of experts and specialists. The competition and cooperation of experts and specialists in this framework allow for synergetic effects that generate better and faster solutions to the search problems. We demonstrate these effects for instantiations of two very different kinds of search problems, automated theorem proving and optimization problems.",,第3页.xls

221,Function allocation for humans and automation in the context of team dynamics,2015,"Within Human Factors Engineering, a decision-making process called function allocation (FA) is used during the design life cycle of complex systems to distribute the system functions, typically identified through a functional requirements analysis, to all human and automated machine agents (or teammates) involved in controlling the system. Most FA methods make allocation decisions primarily by comparing the capabilities of humans and automation, and then by considering secondary factors such as cost, regulations, and the health and safety of workers. The primary analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of humans and machines, however, is almost always considered in terms of individual human or machine capabilities. Yet, FA is fundamentally about teamwork in that the goal of the FA decision-making process is to determine the optimal allocations of functions among agents. Given this framing of FA, and the increasing use of and sophistication of automation, there are two related social psychological issues that current FA methods need to address more thoroughly. First, many principles for effective human teamwork are not considered as central decision points or in the iterative hypothesis and testing phase in most FA methods, despite the fact that social factorshave numerous positive and negative effects on individual and team capabilities. Second, social psychological factors affecting team performance can be difficult to translate to automated agents, and most FA methods currently do not account for this effect. The implications for these issuesare discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",,第3页.xls

223,Stabilizing Agent's Interactions in Dynamic Contexts,2014,"We address the problem of efficient coordination protocols in the contexts where mobile and ad-hoc devices which harbor the selfish agents must achieve a set of dynamic tasks. This work assumes that, due to the dynamic behaviors of the agents induced by the unpredictable availability of these devices and the dynamic of the tasks, it is not possible to devise an efficient coordination which uses prior knowledge about the information of the agents ahead of task achievements. In these contexts, we provide both protocols called depth exploration protocol and width exploration protocol which are based on the formalism of the MDP (Markov Decision Process) and on alliance principle. The aim of our protocols is to ensure and to adapt dynamically the stability of the agent's coordination teams (coalitions) which take into account the agent's withdrawal and the dynamic evolving of the tasks. We develop a theoretical study of our mechanism and we provide an analytical and experimental performance evaluation.",,第3页.xls

The emergent desired behavior is a distributed sorting and clustering based only on local information and a memory register that records the past objects encountered. An optimum weighting function for the memory registers is theoretically derived. The optimum time-dependent weighting function allows sorting and clustering of the randomly distributed objects in the shortest time. By maximizing the average speed of a texture feature (the contrast) we check the central assumption, the intermediate steady-states hypothesis, of our theoretical result. It is proved that the algorithm optimization based on maximum speed variation of the contrast feature gives relationships similar to the theoretically derived annealing law.",,第3页.xls

If everyone working on a certain project is located in the same area, then situational awareness is relatively straightforward; however, the overheads in communications in a multi-site distributed environment can become very large. Consequently, these problems cause developmental delays, as outstanding issues have not been resolved, issues cannot be discussed immediately, or just in time over a multi-site environment. Ontology enables the sharing of an agreement among teams distributed across the sites by making assumptions explicit. The key idea is to have agreement explicitly interpreted by software tools rather than just being implicitly interpreted by human developers. In this paper, we propose development of ontology-based software engineering for multi-site distributed software development utilized software agent.",,第3页.xls

These groups should capture structuring mechanisms common in multi-agent systems, such as teams, cooperative groups, and organisations. Not only should individual agents be dynamic and evolving, but the groups in which the agents occur must be open, flexible and capable of similar evolution and restructuring. We enable the description and implementation of such groups by providing an extension to our previous work on programming languages for agent-based systems based on executable temporal and modal logics. With such formalism as a basis, we consider the grouping aspects within multi-agent systems. In particular, we describe how this logic-based approach to grouping has been implemented in Java and consider how this language can be used for developing multi-agent systems.",,第3页.xls

In this work, the performance of a group of agents - a team - that collaborate to achieve a shared goal where the individual contribution of each agent is unknown, is evaluated. The work thus aims to present a reliable method for calculating a trust value for agents involved in teamwork.

This article provides a short history of the contest since it started and reports in more detail on the cows and cowboys scenario implemented for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 contest editions. We briefly discuss the underlying technological background and conclude with a critical discussion of the experiences and lessons learned.",,第3页.xls
233,Concise Introduction to Multiagent Systems and Distributed Artificial Intelligence,2007,"Multiagent systems is an expanding field that blends classical fields like game theory and decentralized control with modern fields like computer science and machine learning. This monograph provides a concise introduction to the subject, covering the theoretical foundations as well as more recent developments in a coherent and readable manner. The text is centered on the concept of an agent as decision maker. Chapter 1 is a short introduction to the field of multiagent systems. Chapter 2 covers the basic theory of single-agent decision making under uncertainty. Chapter 3 is a brief introduction to game theory, explaining classical concepts like Nash equilibrium. Chapter 4 deals with the fundamental problem of coordinating a team of collaborative agents. Chapter 5 studies the problem of multiagent reasoning and decision making under partial observability. Chapter 6 focuses on the design of protocols that are stable against manipulations by self-interested agents. Chapter 7 provides a short introduction to the rapidly expanding field of multiagent reinforcement learning. The material can be used for teaching a half-semester course on multiagent systems covering, roughly, one chapter per lecture.",,第3页.xls
234,Multi-agent Differential Graphical Games,2011,"Multi-agent systems arise in several domains of engineering and can be used to solve problems which are difficult for an individual agent to solve. Strategies for team decision problems, including optimal control, N-player games (H-infinity control, non-zero sum), and so on are normally solved for off-line by solving associated matrix equations such as the coupled Riccati equations or coupled Hamilton-Jacobi equations. However, using that approach players cannot change their objectives online in real time without calling for a completely new off-line solution for the new strategies. Therefore, in this paper are brought together cooperative control, reinforcement learning, and game theory to present a multi-agent formulation for online solution of team games. The notion of graphical games is developed for dynamical systems, where the dynamics and performance indices for each node depend only on local neighbor information. It is shown that standard definitions for Nash equilibrium are not sufficient for graphical games and a new definition of Interactive Nash Equilibrium is given. We give a cooperative policy iteration algorithm for graphical games that converges to the best response when the neighbors of each agent do not update their policies, and to the cooperative Nash equilibrium when all agents update their policies simultaneously. This is used to develop methods for online adaptive learning solutions of graphical games in real time.",,第3页.xls

236,A multi-agent based new cooperation method in CSCD,2004,"This article presents a framework for multi-agent cooperation based on formal dialogue game in CSCD. It is a new dynamic cooperation model that allows a group of agents to exchange their opinions, possibility and willingness through information seek dialogue at the beginning of cooperation, and then a potential cooperative team will be formed. In the potential agent group, the joint intention for the fulfilling of the task was created by the persuasive dialogue. This model avoids the aimlessness in the task decomposition and assignment in existing CSCD systems and improves the cooperation performance. The basic idea and practical process of the new model are presented and the dialogue logic based on dynamic and modal logic are discussed and used to formalise the new model. Further research issues are given in the last part of the paper.",,第3页.xls
237,What is wrong with us? Improving robustness through social diagnosis,1998,"Robust behavior in complex, dynamic environments mandates that intelligent agents autonomously monitor their own run-time behavior, detect and diagnose failures, and attempt recovery. This challenge is intensified in multiagent settings, where the coordinated and competitive behaviors of other agents affect an agent's own performance. Previous approaches to this problem have often focused on single agent domains and have failed to address or exploit key facets of multi-agent domains, such as handling team failures. We present SAM, a complementary approach to monitoring and diagnosis for multi-agent domains that is particularly well-suited for collaborative settings. SAM includes the following key novel concepts: First, SAM's failure detection technique, inspired by social psychology, utilizes other agents as information sources and detects failures both in an agent and in its teammates. Second, SAM performs social diagnosis, reasoning about the failures in its team using an explicit model of teamwork (previously, teamwork models have been employed only in prescribing agent behaviors in teamwork). Third, SAM employs model shaving to alleviate the inherent inefficiencies associated with representing multiple agent models. We have implemented SAM in a complex, realistic multi-agent domain, and provide detailed empirical results assessing its benefits.",,第3页.xls
238,Designing Training Virtual Environments Supported by Cognitive Agents,2018,"This paper discusses the design of training environments using a virtual reality space populated by virtual characters participating in collaborative work. We are particularly interested in training a single human person who needs to organize and run a team doing collaborative work.

With the explosive growth in accessible data, optimizing decision results can be a daunting task. This article examines techniques for producing optimal solutions to a wide array of assessment challenges.

This article explores four distinct complementary technologies that accomplish this, including software agents and genetic algorithms.",,第3页.xls
240,Modeling teams of specialists,1994,"Often, complex decisions must be made by a group of specialists rather than a single decision maker. To make an effective decision, the combination of the group's expertise must be brought to bear on the situation. Fusing expertise where individuals have very detailed knowledge in their own areas and much weaker understanding of others is characterized by difficulties: agents cannot communicate their expertise in an intelligible way to non-experts because of differences in vocabulary and conceptual content; the process allows for incorrect inferences; and no one knows what anyone else needs to know. Measures and models developed for single agent decision making do not address the complications posed by the fusion of heterogeneous expertise nor the resource limitations which must be considered in evaluating group decisions. We propose the Team of Specialists (TOS) group decision model which partitions agents' knowledge into expert and naive models to address these inadequacies. TOS models group decision making as a process of model refinement linking communications among agents to modifications of the naive portions of their models. The TOS model gives both a normative reference for evaluating group decisions and a characterization of the process by which they evolve. The model of process and criterion for ordering outcomes provided by TOS are the essential prerequisites for devising decision aids.",,第3页.xls
241,Multi-agent dependence by dependence graphs,2002,"In this paper, we present an abstract structure called dependence graph, an extension of the notion of dependence network, as proposed previously (1994). While this latter can be applied to express a set of dependence relations of a single agent, this new structure can be applied to the multi-agent case. It can be used, therefore, for the study of emerging social structures, such as groups and collectives, and may form a knowledge base for managing complexity in both competitive and organisational or other cooperative contexts. We analyze several properties of this structure, relating them to some corresponding social phenomena regarding group formation and cohesiveness.",,第3页.xls
242,Multi-target pursuit formation of multi-agent systems,2011,"The main goal of this paper is to design a team of agents that can accomplish multi-target pursuit formation using a developed leader-follower strategy. It is supposed that every target can accept a certain number of agents. First, each agent can automatically choose its target based on the distance from the agent to the target and the number of agents accepted by the target. In view of the fact that all agents are randomly dispersed in the workplace at the initial time, we present a numbering strategy for them. During the movement of agents, not every agent can always obtain pertinent state information about the targets. So, a developed leader-follower strategy and a pursuit formation algorithm are proposed. Under the proposed method, agents with the same target can maintain a circle formation. Furthermore, it turns out that the pursuit formation algorithm for agents to the desired formation is convergent. Simulation studies are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",,第3页.xls

The resulting model provides a complete and consistent network of activities, artefacts, roles, agents, and resources. Basic features for artefact sharing, agent notification or activity control are adopted for software team coordination.",,第3页.xls
244,Collective-movement teams for cooperative problem solving,2005,"Self-organizing particle systems (swarms) consist of numerous autonomous, reflexive agents (particles) whose collective movements through space are determined primarily by local influences. Such systems have been traditionally used to simulate groups of animals and other biological phenomena. The simple nature of these systems limits their applications in other areas. We believe that by extending these systems and combining them with a top-down approach, they can be transformed into a general problem-solving technique. In this work we present an agent architecture derived by adding goal-directed control mechanisms to particles that allow them to switch between multiple dynamics according to different situations and to keep and propagate information relevant to solving a problem. Simulations of two different tasks related to search for and transportation of objects show that agents are able to not only effectively solve the assigned problems, but that they do so in a more efficient manner than similar but independently moving agents. Further, collectively moving agents display coordination emerging purely from their local interactions and this cooperation provides a clear advantage while solving a problem as a team. These results show that the self-organizing behavior of particle systems can be extended to support problem solving in various areas such as coordinated robotic teams.",,第3页.xls

246,Models of and experiments with e-markets for electric utilities,2003,"Many Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have been built that represent different social structures, such as alliances, teams, coalitions, conventions and markets. Our primary objective in this work was to establish a fairly general-purpose market structure that can be reused in other market-based MASs. We have implemented different models of a deregulated electricity market. The models vary in the types of interaction between buyers and sellers, the mechanisms used to transact deals in the market, and in the role of the central agent. Extensive experiments were then conducted on the models to determine the type of market structure best suited for trading. The criteria of evaluation were based on resource consumption, number of deals completed, demand satisfied, supply used, excess-over-need bought, and prices paid. The conclusions should be applicable to other deregulated consumer markets of perishable commodities with strong time-dependence.",,第3页.xls
247,Search Strategies in Evolutionary Multi-Agent Systems: The Effect of Cooperation and Reward on Solution Quality,2011,"Cooperation and reward of strategic agents in an evolutionary optimization framework is explored in order to better solve engineering design problems. Agents in this Evolutionary Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS) framework rely on one another to better their performance, but also vie for the opportunity to reproduce. The level of cooperation and reward is varied by altering the amount of interaction between agents and the fitness function describing their evolution. The effect of each variable is measured using the problem objective function as a metric. Increasing the amount of cooperation in the evolving team is shown to lead to improved performance for several multimodal and complex numerical optimization and three-dimensional layout problems. However, fitness functions that utilize team-based rewards are found to be inferior to those that reward on an individual basis. The performance trends for different fitness functions and levels of cooperation remain when EMAS is applied to the more complex problem of three-dimensional packing as well.

249,Conflicts and negotiation in single function agent based design systems,1996,"A basic ingredient of Concurrent Engineering (CE) is that all aspects of the product's life cycle should be considered as early as possible during design. A key idea that has been adopted for the implementation of CE is the use of a team, in which each member is an expert on some aspect of the product in a phase of its life cycle. In our work, we use a team of software agents. Our goal is to study in detail the interactions, conflicts, and conflict resolution that is possible with such a multiagent system. The approach is to use Single Function Agents (SiFAs), each of which can perform a very specialized task, from a single point of view. The ability to represent expertise with different points of view is very important in design. These different points of view usually cause conflicts among agents, and these conflicts need to be resolved in order for the design process to be successful. Therefore, agents need to be capable of detecting and resolving these conflicts. This paper presents a model of conflicts and negotiations in the SiFA framework. A hierarchy of possible conflicts is proposed and the steps of the negotiation process are discussed.",,第3页.xls

One learning automaton is associated with each agent acting in a state and the automata acting within a state may communicate with each other. However, there is no communication between the automata present in different states, thus making the system partially decentralized. We propose novel algorithms so that the entire automata team converges to the policy that maximizes the long-term expected reward per step. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms.",,第3页.xls

252,Innovation Teams and Organizational Creativity: Reasoning with Computational Simulations,2018,"A computational social simulation encourages systematic reasoning about the management of innovation teams and organizational creativity. This article draws upon historical literature to identify a potential dilemma faced by business organizations: Is it better to promote creative behavior across a whole organization or focus on the development of small and highly creative teams? We formulate the dilemma from the literature on organizational creativity, and explore it using a multi-agent simulation. Our study models creative behavior abstractly, as the ability to introduce novelty. By varying the scale and scope of non-conformist behavior in the simulation, our research supports the systematic study of thebreadth vs. depthdilemma. The results of this study invite an informed examination of strategies to sustain innovation based on the introduction of either a small number of significantly novel ideas, or a large number of novel but more familiar ideas. Results from this study on change agency also indicate that there is a possible trade-off between a highly creative team and its creative efficiency, drawing attention to the importance of a creative critical mass in an organization. We also discuss the implications of these results and our research approach. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第3页.xls
253,CMDBENCH: A Benchmark for Coarse-to-fine Multimodal Data Discovery in Compound AI Systems,2024,"Compound AI systems (CASs) that employ LLMs as agents to accomplish knowledge-intensive tasks via interactions with tools and data retrievers have garnered significant interest within database and AI communities. While these systems have the potential to supplement typical analysis workflows of data analysts in enterprise data platforms, unfortunately, CASs are subject to the same data discovery challenges that analysts have encountered over the years - silos of multimodal data sources, created across teams and departments within an organization, make it difficult to identify appropriate data sources for accomplishing the task at hand. Existing data discovery benchmarks do not model such multimodality and multiplicity of data sources. Moreover, benchmarks of CASs prioritize only evaluating end-to-end task performance. To catalyze research on evaluating the data discovery performance of multimodal data retrievers in CASs within a real-world setting, we propose CMDBENCH, a benchmark modeling the complexity of enterprise data platforms. We adapt existing datasets and benchmarks in open-domain - from question answering and complex reasoning tasks to natural language querying over structured data - to evaluate coarse- and fine-grained data discovery and task execution performance. Our experiments reveal the impact of data retriever design on downstream task performance - 46% drop in task accuracy on average - across various modalities, data sources, and task difficulty. The results indicate the need to develop optimization strategies to identify appropriate LLM agents and retrievers for efficient execution of CASs over enterprise data.",,第3页.xls
254,A common basis for agent organisation in BDI languages,2008,"Programming languages based on the BDI style of agent model are now common. Within these there appears to be some, limited, agreement on the core functionality of agents. However, when we come to multi-agent organisations, not only do many BDI languages have no specific organisational structures, but those that do exist are very diverse. In this paper, we aim to provide a unifying framework for the core aspects of agent organisation, covering groups, teams and roles, as well as organisations. Thus, we describe a simple organisational mechanism, and show how several well known approaches can be embedded within it. Although the mechanism we use is derived from the METATEM programming language, we do not assume any specific BDI language. The organisational mechanism is intended to be independent of the underlying agent language and so we aim to provide a common core for future developments in agent organisation.",,第3页.xls
255,BOAs: backoff adaptive scheme for task allocation with fault tolerance and uncertainty management,2004,"In this paper, we propose the backoff adaptive scheme (BOAs) as a new technique for the automatic allocation of tasks amongst a team of heterogeneous mobile robots. It is an optimal, decentralized decision making scheme that utilizes explicit communication between the agents. A structured and unified framework is also proposed for task specification. This scheme is fault tolerant (to robot malfunctions) and allows for uncertainty in the nature of task specification in terms of the actual number of robots required. Team demography may change without the need for the respecification of tasks. The adaptive feature in BOAs further improves the flexibility of the team. Realistic simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the scheme.",,第3页.xls

Robot soccer is a good opportunity to implement and test the cooperative group behavior of mobile robots. Basically such a soccer playing team of autonomous robots form a multi agent system (MAS). To individually control each of the robots of a team you can either define a central observing entity which keeps track of the situation on the playground or implement proper control algorithms on each robot in a way that it performs a self-determined intelligent behaviour.

259,Sleeper Social Bots: a new generation of AI disinformation bots are already a political threat,2024,"This paper presents a study on the growing threat of sleeper social bots, AI-driven social bots in the political landscape, created to spread disinformation and manipulate public opinion. We based the name sleeper social bots on their ability to pass as humans on social platforms, where they're embedded like political sleeper agents, making them harder to detect and more disruptive. To illustrate the threat these bots pose, our research team at the University of Southern California constructed a demonstration using a private Mastodon server, where ChatGPT-driven bots, programmed with distinct personalities and political viewpoints, engaged in discussions with human participants about a fictional electoral proposition. Our preliminary findings suggest these bots can convincingly pass as human users, actively participate in conversations, and effectively disseminate disinformation. Moreover, they can adapt their arguments based on the responses of human interlocutors, showcasing their dynamic and persuasive capabilities. College students participating in initial experiments failed to identify our bots, underscoring the urgent need for increased awareness and education about the dangers of AI-driven disinformation, and in particular, disinformation spread by bots. The implications of our research point to the significant challenges posed by social bots in the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election and beyond.",,第3页.xls
260,Strategic coalition for improving generalization ability of multi-agent with evolutionary learning,2004,"In dynamic systems, such as social and economic systems, complex interactions emerge among its members. In that case, their behaviors become adaptive according to changing environment. In many cases, an individual's behaviors can be modeled by a stimulus-response system in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we use the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game, which is simple yet capable of dealing with complex problems, to model the dynamic systems. We propose strategic coalition consisting of many agents and simulate their emergence in a co-evolutionary teaming environment. Also we introduce the concept of confidence for agents in a coalition and show how such confidences help to improve the generalization ability of the whole coalition. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that co-evolutionary learning with coalitions and confidence allows better performing strategies that generalize well.",,第3页.xls

In the multi-agent team only some of the agents can obtain the leader's state directly. The leader's state considered is time varying. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness of the tracking error system. It is proved that the ultimate bound of the tracking errors is proportional to the sampling period. A linear matrix inequality approach is developed to determine the allowable sampling period and the feasible control gain.,,第3页.xls
262,Visualizations for Communicating Intelligent Agent Generated Courses of Action,2019,"Future human-autonomy teams will benefit from intelligent agents that can quickly deliberate across multiple parameters to generate candidate courses of action (COAs). This experiment evaluated the design of an interface to communicate agent-generated COAs to a human operator. Twelve participants completed 14 trials, each consisting of a series of tasks that required participants' selection of the best COA in terms of quality, speed, fuel, and detectability parameters. Trial score and speed of participants' selection were measured as a function of COA visualization (1, 4, or 8 COAs) as well as the type of agent. Supplemental trials in which participants could choose which visualization to employ for COA selection were also conducted. The data showed that presenting multiple COAs were better than a single COA. Differences between the 4 and 8 COA visualizations were not quite as definitive: selections were significantly faster with 4 COAs than 8, but participants' preferences were divided based upon agent comprehensiveness and individual strategy differences. The results also showed that the agent's reasoning process should be communicated more precisely besides just what parameters are being considered in generating COAs.",,第3页.xls
263,Automation of Call Center Workforce Management Using NeuralProphet,2022,"This research addresses some of the current as well as widely used agent headcount prediction or forecasting models in the call center systems. Performance provided by the models used today are reasonably good, however there are some drawbacks which can be fixed with the help of AI based time series algorithms. In this paper, four such algorithms namely Holt-Winter's, ARIMA, SARIMA and NeuralProphet were used. For this purpose, the data of hourly call arrivals for a period of 3 years was collected and training and testing was performed on it. The accuracy of the models was compared on the basis of the root mean squared error (RMSE) test performed on them. The proposed work benefits Small Organizations who do not have the money or the resources to afford a separate planning team for effective headcount planning and can only afford limited number of agents in the call center system.

265,Co-operating mobile agents for distributed parallel processing,1999,"We describe a novel approach to dynamic distributed parallel processing using a mobile agent-based infrastructure. Our goal is to extend the concept of the Parallel Virtual Machine architecture (Sunderam, 1990) by using a combination of collaborative and mobile software agents to enable automatic and dynamic configuration of distributed processes. Our approach to distributed processing is regulated by a two-tier management system. At the strategic level, an anchored centralised agent is responsible for managing user interaction and determining how tasks are to be distributed. Whilst the mobile agents who deliver code to remote machines, manage local processing at an operational level. We therefore developed specialised mobile agents, each performing particular roles, which co-operate as a team to achieve user defined goals. The resulting system provides users with a much simpler means of utilising the power of distributed parallel computing.",,第3页.xls

267,Towards a descriptive model of agent strategy search,2001,"It is argued that, due to the complexity of most economic phenomena, the chances of deriving correct models from a priori principles are very small. Instead, a more descriptive approach to modelling should be pursued. Agent-based modelling is characterised as a step in this direction. However many agent-based models use off-the-shelf algorithms from computer science without regard to their descriptive accuracy. This paper attempts an agent model that describes as accurately as possible the behaviour of subjects reported in Sonnemans (1998). It takes a framework for teaming that is compatible with thinking in cognitive science and within this framework attempts to identify the specific process that matches the behaviour of the subjects. This suggests further modelling improvements and experiments.",,第3页.xls

An optimal team of agents is dynamically selected for every retrieval problem. A flexible protocol allows for dynamic addition of search agents incorporating new pattern recognition techniques. These agents are coded as mobile agents, so that they can travel across a wide area network and analyze the documents at their sources. The separation of physical image forms and their logical structural composition allows the search agents to operate over heterogeneous repositories.

269,"A scalable, distributed algorithm for allocating workers in embedded systems",2001,"This paper presents a scalable threshold-based algorithm for allocating workers to a given task whose demand evolves dynamically over time. The algorithm is fully distributed and solely based on the local perceptions of the individuals. Each agent decides autonomously and deterministically to work only when it feels that some work needs to be done based on its sensory inputs. In this paper, we applied the worker allocation algorithm to a collective manipulation case study concerned with the gathering and clustering of initially scattered small objects. The aggregation experiment has been studied at three different experimental levels by using macroscopic and microscopic probabilistic models, and embodied simulations. Results show that teams using a number of active workers dynamically controlled by the allocation algorithm achieve similar or better performances in aggregation than those characterized by a constant team size, while using a considerably reduced number of agents over the whole aggregation process. Since this algorithm does not imply any form of explicit communication among agents, it represents a cost-effective solution for controlling the number of active workers in embedded systems consisting of a few to thousands of units.",,第3页.xls

A rescue team composed of heterogeneous agentsfire brigades, ambulances, and policetakes active part in the disastrous situation where about 100 civilian agents move autonomously. By comparing with rescue operations of two teams, we showed that the search and rescue in disasters can be used as a test-bed for multi-agent systems. The comparing experiments made clear that rescue task is not well defined in spite of its practical importance, and planning based on multi-perspectives on disaster losses is necessary. It points that the rescue problem is not only a test-bed for multiagent system but also for laboratory work for practical system.",,第3页.xls

Firstly coach gathers data from noisy environment to identify pattern of player agent. Then compute the probability of pattern compared with current situation by statistical calculations. Finally make successful decision according to the result of change role with correlalive teammates. The new approach based on Change Role is tested In ChinaOpen2007 in Robot Soccer Game, Simulation 2D team-HfutEngine2D, and get 2nd. In the past World RoboCup2008, we got 7th.",,第3页.xls
274,Coordinated exploration in conflicting multi-stage games,2008,"The analysis of the collective behavior of agents in a distributed multi-agent environment received a lot of attention in the past decade. More accurately, coordination was studied intensely because it enables agents to converge to Pareto optimal solutions and Nash equilibria. Most of these studies focussed on team games. In this paper we report on a technique for finding fair solutions in conflicting interest multi-stage games. Our hierarchical periodic policies algorithm is based on the characteristics of a homo egualis society in which the players also care about the proportional distribution of the pay-off in relation to the pay-off of the other players. This feature is built into a hierarchy of learning automata which is suited for playing sequential decision problems.",,第3页.xls
275,Grammar-based cooperative learning for evolving collective behaviours in multi-agent systems,2022,"This paper presents a novel grammar-based evolutionary approach which allows autonomous emergence of heterogeneity in collective behaviours. The approach adopts a context-free grammar to describe the syntax of evolving rules, which facilitates an evolutionary algorithm to evolve rule structures without manual intervention. We propose modifications to the genome structure to address the requirements of heterogeneity, and two cooperative learning architectures based on team learning and cooperative coevolution. Experimental evaluations with four behaviours illustrate that both architectures are successful in evolving heterogeneous collective behaviours. Both heterogeneous architectures surpass a homogeneous model in performance for deriving a flocking macro behaviour, however the homogeneous model is superior for evolving micro behaviours such as cohesion and alignment. The results infer that by placing the entire set of agent rules and their syntax under evolutionary control, effective solutions to complex problems can be evolved when human knowledge and intuition becomes insufficient.",,第3页.xls

For the outdoor robots, they can use GPS to get the path information. But in a GPS-denied environment, the robots cannot get the support from satellites. We design an air-ground robot team to provide a solution to this problem. It consists of a micro aerial vehicle with a vertical camera and a horizontal camera, and two micro ground vehicle with an ultrasonic sensor and a colour sensor. Experimental results are presented demonstrating this air-ground robot team's ability to operate successfully in indoor environments.",,第3页.xls
277,Cooperative Route Planning Framework for Multiple Distributed Assets in Maritime Applications,2022,"This work formalizes the Route Planning Problem (RPP), wherein a set of distributed assets (e.g., ships, submarines, unmanned systems) simultaneously plan routes to optimize a team goal (e.g., find the location of an unknown threat or object in minimum time and/or fuel consumption) while ensuring that the planned routes satisfy certain constraints (e.g., avoiding collisions and obstacles). This problem becomes overwhelmingly complex for multiple distributed assets as the search space grows exponentially to design such plans. The RPP is formalized as a Team Discrete Markov Decision Process (TDMDP) and we propose a Multi-agent Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MaMoRL) framework for solving it. We investigate challenges in deploying the solution in real-world settings and study approximation opportunities. We experimentally demonstrate MaMoRL's effectiveness on multiple real-world and synthetic grids, as well as for transfer learning. MaMoRL is deployed for use by the Naval Research Laboratory - Marine Meteorology Division (NRL-MMD), Monterey, CA.",,第3页.xls
278,Beyond Playing to Win: Creating a Team of Agents With Distinct Behaviors for Automated Gameplay,2023,"In this article, we present an approach to generate a team of general video game playing agents with differentiated behaviors that can ultimately assist in the game development process. We consider the agent behavior as the corresponding outcomes of playing the game: rate of wins, score, exploration, enemies killed, items collected, etc. We create and identify agents that are expected to achieve particular goals but do not necessarily simulate human behavior during gameplay. We present a solution that, by heuristic diversification, provides a controller with different heuristics and a corresponding set of weights, driving its actions. Given the simplicity of this behavior-encoding and its easiness to evolve, we use Multidimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites to generate different solutions that elicit particular behaviors and assemble a team. The resulting agents are allocated in a feature space, used to identify the expectations of each of them. We generate a team for four games of the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence framework and find six different behavior-type agents in each. We include an experiment to check the portability of these agents when playing alternative levels and an exploratory work aiming to use them to detect design flaws in game levels.",,第3页.xls

However, research on the affection of users who use voice agents has not been studied yet. In this study, we assumed that users' affective responses to three Voice Agents (Siri, Bixby, and Google Assistant) might be different. To do this, we asked the participants to perform four tasks (voice registration, checking information, using the specific functions, and joking). Hence, affective responses were measured by SAM (Self-assessment Manikin). Finally, we found out the difference of users' affective responses to each voice agent. Then we propose design factors for user-friendly voice agent on the mobile.",,第3页.xls
280,Building high assurance human-centric decision systems,2015,"Many future decision support systems will be human-centric, i.e., require substantial human oversight and control. Because these systems often provide critical services, high assurance is needed that they satisfy their requirements. This paper, the product of an interdisciplinary research team of experts in formal methods, adaptive agents, and cognitive science, addresses this problem by proposing a new process for developing high assurance human-centric decision systems. This process uses AI (artificial intelligence) methods-i.e., a cognitive model to predict human behavior and an adaptive agent to assist the human-to improve system performance, and software engineering methods-i.e., formal modeling and analysis-to obtain high assurance that the system behaves as intended. The paper describes a new method for synthesizing a formal system model from Event Sequence Charts, a variant of Message Sequence Charts, and a Mode Diagram, a specification of system modes and mode transitions. It also presents results of a new pilot study investigating the optimal level of agent assistance for different users in which the agent design was evaluated using synthesized user models. Finally, it reviews a cognitive model for predicting human overload in complex human-centric systems. To illustrate the development process and our new techniques, we describe a human-centric decision system for controlling unmanned vehicles.",,第3页.xls
281,A Hierarchical Variable Autonomy Mixed-Initiative Framework for Human-Robot Teaming in Mobile Robotics [arXiv],2022,"This paper presents a Mixed-Initiative (MI) framework for addressing the problem of control authority transfer between a remote human operator and an AI agent when cooperatively controlling a mobile robot. Our Hierarchical Expert-guided Mixed-Initiative Control Switcher (HierEMICS) leverages information on the human operator's state and intent. The control switching policies are based on a criticality hierarchy. An experimental evaluation was conducted in a high-fidelity simulated disaster response and remote inspection scenario, comparing HierEMICS with a state-of-the-art Expert-guided Mixed-Initiative Control Switcher (EMICS) in the context of mobile robot navigation. Results suggest that HierEMICS reduces conflicts for control between the human and the AI agent, which is a fundamental challenge in both the MI control paradigm and also in the related shared control paradigm. Additionally, we provide statistically significant evidence of improved, navigational safety (i.e., fewer collisions), LOA switching efficiency, and conflict for control reduction.",,第3页.xls
282,An Agent-Based Model to Study Effects of Team Processes on Compliance with Safety Regulations at an Airline Ground Service Organization,2015,"Maintaining high levels of safety under conditions of ever increasing air traffic is a challenging task. Failures to comply with safety-related regulations are often considered to be important contributors to safety occurrences. To address the issue of compliance, approaches based on external regulation of the employees' behavior were proposed. Unfortunately, an externally imposed control is often not internalized by employees and has a short-term effect on their performance. To achieve a long-term effect, employees need to be internally motivated to adhere to regulations. Theories from social sciences propose that team processes play an important role in the dynamics of individual motivation. In this paper an agent-based model is proposed, by which the impact of social interaction and coordination in teams of platform employees on their individual motivation and compliance with safety regulations at an airline ground service organization are explored. The model was simulated and partially validated by a case study performed at a real airline ground service organization. The model was able to reproduce behavioral patterns of compliance of the platform employees in this study.",,第3页.xls

A number of approaches-from flexible automation to autonomous agents-were reviewed, and their advantages and disadvantages were discussed. In addition, two key human performance issues (trust and situation awareness) related to H-A teaming for multirobot control and some promising user interface design solutions to address these issues were discussed. Some major individual differences factors (operator spatial ability, attentional control ability, and gaming experience) were identified that may impact H-A teaming in the context of robotics control.",,第3页.xls
285,Neuro-Evolution Approaches to Collective Behavior,2009,"This paper is a preliminary study of the types of collective behavior tasks that are best solved by Neuro-Evolution (NE). This research tests a hypothesis that for a multi-rover task, the best approach (for deriving effective collective behaviors) is to evolve complete Artificial Neural Network (ANN) controllers, and then combine controller behaviors in a collective behavior context. Such methods are called multi-agent Conventional Neuro-Evolution (Multi-Agent CNE). This is opposed to methods such as Enforced Sub-Populations (ESP) which evolves individual neurons and then combines them to form complete ANN controllers. Single and multi-agent CNE and ESP approaches to evolving collective behavior solutions are tested comparatively in the multi-rover task. The multi-rover task requires that teams of rovers (controllers) cooperate in order to detect features of interest in a virtual environment. Results indicate that a Multi-Agent CNE approach derives rover teams with a higher task performance and genotype diversity, comparative to ESP.",,第3页.xls

289,The northern dimension: the problem of spatial development and the capabilities of online technology,2019,"Digital technologies have permeated all aspects of our lives, transforming research, organizational, and business processes as well as the ways suppliers and consumers of goods and services communicate. The level of territorial development in high latitudes, including the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation, is uneven. However, what is common for low-population and remote areas is the lack of units for generating knowledge and scientific and educational potential, which are theoretically necessary for building innovative systems. The presented study provides statistics that characterize the knowledge-generating potential of the Arctic territories of the Russian Federation. The technological capabilities of the 21st century make it possible to find a solution for innovative, efficient development of such territories. The authors propose a structure for multi-agent geographically distributed cooperation between the subdivisions of a single team. The localized part of the team (local agents) identifies the problem and finds agents (the remote part of the team) that can offer a globally competitive technology. The latter generally include competence centers and centers of excellence located in other territories. Then, both parts of the team glocalize the solution. The technical framework of multi-agent geographically distributed cooperation involves using online technology to organize synchronous, real-time messaging via digital information channels. This creates a fundamentally different approach to spatial development design. The online, real-time design process is organized through the interaction between the local agent and the remote agents. The result is the implementation of an efficient territorial development model: development as mastering- management - resources - hierarchy of authority - customization. Efficient operation of the localized part of a geographically distributed system requires an adequate infrastructure. Therefore, the authors aim to optimize the functional completeness of the infrastructure.",,第3页.xls
290,A passivity-based framework for coordinated distributed control of AUV teams: Guaranteeing stability in presence of range communication constraints,2016,"This paper presents a cooperative, distance-based, distributed control law for multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) executing a mission while meeting mutual communications constraints. The classic graph theory provides the essential tools to model the whole network of interacting robots, which is then handled within the energy-based, port-Hamiltonian framework. The virtual interaction forces generated over each link are represented by visco-elastic couplings. The passivity theory allows the construction of a Lyapunov function for the closed loop system to demonstrate the stability in large of the whole network with the synthesized control law. Moreover, always using passivity-based techniques, the behaviour of the group is made as flexible as possible with arbitrary split and join events. Several software simulations, involving a team or sub-teams of agents that perform typical missions in marine environment, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",,第3页.xls

The model represents a universe where human agents interact with artificial agents (software agents). Considering the vision of the system, it can be classified among advanced systems for it is client-oriented (student) and provides value added educational services, due to the collaborative learning attribute. The model proposes an original architecture where elements of the socio-cultural theory of collaborative learning are assigned to the artificial intelligence components (the multi-agent system). The expected results are: conceptual models (agents, learning and teaching strategies, student profiles and group profiles, communication between agents, negotiation strategies and coalition formation), software entities, and a methodology to evaluate the performance of e-Learning systems.",,第3页.xls
292,TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE TEAMWORK MODEL FOR HIGHLY DYNAMIC DOMAINS,2010,"Cooperative behaviour of agents within highly dynamic and nondeterministic domains is an active field of research. In particular establishing responsive teamwork, where agents are able to react to dynamic changes in the environment while facing unreliable communication and sensory noise, is an open problem. Unexpectedly changing situations force agents to react and adapt under tight time-constraints. Hence they often cannot communicate or agree upon their decisions before acting upon them. We present a novel model for cooperative behaviour geared towards such domains. In our approach, the agents estimate each other's decision and correct these estimations once they receive contradictory information. We aim at a comprehensive approach for agent teamwork featuring intuitive modelling capabilities for multi-agent activities, abstractions over activities and agents, and clear operational semantics for the new model. We show experimentally that the resulting behaviour stabilises towards teamwork and can achieve a cooperative goal.",,第3页.xls

295,Dialogue-based model for multi-agent cooperative interaction,2005,"Due to the randomness and blindness in the task decomposition and task allocation of the cooperative design, a dialogue-based multi-agent interaction framework was proposed. Firstly, the initiator opened an information-seeking dialogue with each agent in turn, inquired the specialty domain, ability, opportunity and willingness for joining in a task, and judged whether an agent was suitable. Secondly, the initiator opened a persuasion dialogue for asking each agent to take same intention, namely regarding-realizing design task as its own intention. Thirdly, the initiator might ask each agent to accept that the agents in the potential team have same individual intention and mutual intention which would be confirmed in joint belief and broadcasted to each agent. The utility and cost of dialogues based on an example were analyzed and further research issues were proposed.",,第3页.xls
296,Building Coalitions of Heterogeneous Agents Using Weighted Bipartite Graphs,2015,"Teams of agents with different skills can solve critical missions by efficiently joining their complementary abilities. One critical step to exploit the distinct resources available on a set of agents is to form a coalition, i.e., an alliance that satisfies the requirements imposed by a mission. In this work, we represent the relation between agent capabilities and required resources for executing a given task by a weighted bipartite graph. Using this graph, we find an assignment between agents and resource capabilities such that the total weight of capabilities is maximized. From this assignment, also known as matching in Graph Theory, we compute a coalition of agents whose total resource capabilities can satisfy the task resource requirements. Finally, we measure the heterogeneity of the computed coalition and analyze how it is affected by the task constraints and the amount of resources present in the agents.",,第3页.xls

These issues are important in Learning community like a CoPs (both in educational and organisational context), as they promote the processes of knowledge sharing, collaborative learning, and development of collective efficacy among community members. The system kernel of AIS supports two types of agents (human agent and artificial agents) that help to manage the collaborative learning activity into the community, whereas the integration mechanism supports an agent to interact, coordinate and monitor the activities between agents. AIS for CoPS facilitate the team interaction. This work takes place in the framework of the design of a training environment using collaborative reality like community of practice. In this context, we defend the thesis that it is possible to implement a generic and adaptive intelligent tutoring system (called ITAgAGS) in a collaborative environment, in order to provide pedagogical aid for the learner and pedagogical assistance for the trainer. Our proposal is to integrate ITS in a multi-agent system like JAIS developed during our thesis.",,第3页.xls
299,Recognizing Multiplayer Behaviors Using Synthetic Training Data,2020,"Accurate recognition of group behaviors is essential to the design of engaging networked multiplayer games. However, contemporary data-driven machine learning solutions are difficult to apply during the game development process, given that no authentic gameplay data is yet available for use as training data. In this paper, we investigate the use of synthetic training data, i.e., gameplay data that is generated by AI-controlled agent teams programmed to perform each of the behaviors to be recognized in groups of human players. The particular task we focus on is to recognize group movement formations in player-controlled avatars in a realistic virtual world. We choose five typical military team movement patterns for the formation recognition task and train machine learning models using procedurally generated unit trajectories as training data. The experiments were conducted using ResNet and EfficientNet, which are two popular convolutional neural network architectures for image classifications. The synthetic data is augmented by creating variations in image rotation, unit spacing, team size, and positional perturbations to bridge the gap between synthetic and human gameplay data. We demonstrate that high-accuracy behavior recognition can be achieved using deep neural networks by applying the aforementioned data augmentation methods to simulated gameplay data.",,第3页.xls

We describe our application of episodic SMDP Sarsa (lambda) with linear tile-coding function approximation and variable lambda to learning higher-level decisions in a keepaway subtask of RoboCup soccer. In keepaway, one team, the keepers, tries to keep control of the ball for as long as possible despite the efforts of the takers.

302,"Co-ordination in RoboCup's 2D simulation league: Setplays as flexible, multi-robot plans",2010,"Strategic planning and multi-agent coordination are major research topics in the domain of RoboCup. Research was, in the first years, directed towards development of low level skills and positional co-ordination. The competitive level has in between risen to new standards, which makes the development of highlevel co-operation necessary. The importance of the concept of Setplay, i.e., small multirobot plans to deal with particular situations, to structure a robotic soccer team behaviour, has been acknowledged by many researchers, but no general framework for the development and execution of generic Setplays has been introduced in the context of RoboCup. This paper presents such a framework for high-level Setplay definition and execution in the 2D simulation league, though applicable to any RoboCup co-operative league and similar domains. The framework is built upon a standard, flexible and league-independent language, which defines Setplays that are interpreted and executed at run-time, using inter-robot communication. A major step in the development of the Setplay framework is its usage and testing in the scope of the FCPortugal team, which participates in the RoboCup 2D-simulation league, where it won several titles. After this successful implementation, described in this paper, the framework will be used in the mid-size league, and possibly in other new environments. Recent developments have made it possible to use Setplays in play-on situations, which had not been possible before. Also, a graphical tool for Setplay definition has been developed, and used in the context of this team.",,第3页.xls
303,Hybrid Control of Multi-Agent Systems under Local Temporal Tasks and Relative-Distance Constraints,2015,"In this paper, we propose a distributed hybrid control strategy for multi-agent systems where each agent has a local task specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula and at the same time is subject to relative-distance constraints with its neighboring agents. The local tasks capture the temporal requirements on individual agents' behaviors, while the relative-distance constraints impose requirements on the collective motion of the whole team. The proposed solution relies only on relative-state measurements among the neighboring agents without the need for explicit information exchange. It is guaranteed that the local tasks given as syntactically co-safe or general LTL formulas are fulfilled and the relative-distance constraints are satisfied at all time. The approach is demonstrated with computer simulations.",,第3页.xls
304,Guaranteed global performance through local coordinations,2011,"It is an amazing fact that remarkably complex behaviors could emerge from a large collection of very rudimentary dynamical agents through very simple local interactions. However, it still remains elusive on how to design these local interactions among agents so as to achieve certain desired collective behaviors. This paper aims to tackle this challenge and proposes a divide-and-conquer approach to guarantee specified global behaviors through local coordination and control design for multi-agent systems. The basic idea is to decompose the requested global specification into subtasks for each individual agent in such a way that the fulfillment of these subtasks by each individual agent will imply the satisfaction of the global specification as a team. First, it is shown by a counterexample that not all specifications can be decomposed in this sense. Then, the main part of the paper is set to identify conditions for the proposed decomposability. Later on, the result is generalized to the case of arbitrary finite number of agents, and a hierarchical algorithm is proposed, which is shown to be a sufficient condition. Finally, a cooperative control scenario for a team of three robots is developed to illustrate the task decomposition procedure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls

306,Unlocking underrepresented use-cases for large language model-driven human-robot task planning,2024,"Large language models (LLM) are now the de facto task planners for Embodied AI (EAI) systems. This shift can be attributed to LLMs' powerful, emergent properties which enable their adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal to no fine tuning via prompting. However, we find that LLM-driven task planning is not a solved problem. In this work we measure the extent to which these models can be adapted to complex and domain-specific task planning via few-shot prompting. Additionally, we contribute quantitative and qualitative analysis on prompt robustness. Lastly, to meet the challenges of adapting EAI systems to real-world, industrial domains, we adopt a human-in-the-loop approach to guarantee safe and interpretable task planning and execution. We successfully demonstrate co-located, human-robot teaming where an Augmented Reality (AR) headset mediates information exchanged between an EAI agent and human operator for a variety of inspection tasks. To our knowledge the use of an AR headset for multimodal grounding and the application of EAI to industrial tasks are novel contributions within Embodied AI research.",,第3页.xls
307,Building collaborative intelligent agents: revealing main pillars,2006,"Software agents are persistent, knowledgeable, autonomous, collaborative, and learnable entities. One important feature of software agents is the ability to interact and communicate as a team to achieve more than they could individually. Although the belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent model is possibly the best known and used model of practical reasoning agent; nevertheless, this model does not address the key concept of how individual agent learn from the environment and manipulate itself to collaborate with others. In this paper we present a novel approach that customize the BDI model to define a so-called RBDIA: Rapport-belief-desire-intention-adaptation as a generic method to support progress from individual autonomous agent concept towards a collaborative multiple agents. Rapport here refers to the component that connects an agent to its environment, whereas adaptation module incorporates mechanisms of learning.

The main goals of the project are increased safety and fuel efficiency. The system we have designed consists of a group of control agents, a coalition manager agent, and a system interface agent. Agents work autonomously to accomplish their assigned tasks. An interface agent interacts with drivers, who can override the actions of the automated system at any time. For handling any complex operation, the coalition manager can organize agents to team up, forming a coalition that allows agents to share data objects and agent capability lists. This paper describes the fundamental multiagent coalition mechanism, and details the intelligent agent-oriented programming approach.",,第3页.xls
309,A reinforcement learning approach to coordinate exploration with limited communication in continuous action games,2016,"Learning automata are reinforcement learners belonging to the class of policy iterators. They have already been shown to exhibit nice convergence properties in a wide range of discrete action game settings. Recently, a new formulation for a continuous action reinforcement learning automata (CARLA) was proposed. In this paper, we study the behavior of these CARLA in continuous action games and propose a novel method for coordinated exploration of the joint-action space. Our method allows a team of independent learners, using CARLA, to find the optimal joint action in common interest settings. We first show that independent agents using CARLA will converge to a local optimum of the continuous action game. We then introduce a method for coordinated exploration which allows the team of agents to find the global optimum of the game. We validate our approach in a number of experiments.",,第3页.xls

We define several stability notions and optimization problems for this model. We prove the hardness of the decision problems related to our optimization criteria and show easiness of finding individually stable partitions. We introduce a heuristic optimizer for coalition formation in this setting. We evaluate results of the heuristic optimizer and the results of local search for individually stable partitions with respect to brute-force MaxSum and MaxMin solvers.",,第3页.xls

The wide range of interaction design capabilities offered by this data requires methods and run-time architectures able to cope with the integration of the incoming data from the interaction environment into the applications. Human-centred computing takes into account what the state of user interaction is and how this data can be used to actually make it useful. A multi-agent system architecture is described. This architecture is able to tackle the arrival of context data by means of a set of sensors and interface agents that filter and process the context-of-use data to produce new presentations. The context of use provides information about the user, the platform, the physical environment and the current task the user is performing. These new presentations produced are adapted according to the context-of-use information gathered by applying a mixed-initiative approach to overcome some of the usual flaws found in full-adaptive applications.",,第3页.xls
312,CIA - A collaboration and coordination infrastructure for personal agents,1999,"Software agents are one of the means to relieve users from searching, sorting and filtering information in their daily work. For fast and efficient implementation of agents there needs to be a powerful infrastructure supporting collaboration and coordination between agents and their users. In this document we propose such an infrastructure where the main focus is on modularity, efficiency, realtime-communication and resilience. Typical scenarios that can efficiently be realized with our system are diary-systems with integrated room-reservation service, team-assembly and workflow systems or even videoconferencing with advanced conference establishment. We introduce the concept of a so called Agent Cluster which contains all personal agents of one user and can be segmented into subclusters. This cluster is build around a software bus and contains many supportive agents for standard tasks. The current status and the On-going development of cur project are discussed at the end of the paper.",,第3页.xls
313,The influence of social norms and social consciousness on intention reconciliation,2002,"Research on resource-bounded agents has established. that rational agents. need to be able to revise their commitments in light of new opportunities. In the context of collaborative activities, rational agents must be able to reconcile their intentions to do team-related actions with other, conflicting intentions. The SPIRE experimental system allows the process of intention reconciliation in team contexts to be simulated and studied. Initial work with SPIRE examined the impact of environmental factors and agent utility functions on individual and group outcomes in the context of one set of social norms governing collaboration. This paper extends those results by further studying the effect of environmental factors and the agents' level of social consciousness and by comparing the impact of two different types of social norms on agent behavior and outcomes. The results show that the choice of social norms influences the accuracy of the agents' responses to varying environmental factors, as well as the effectiveness of social consciousness and other aspects of agents' utility functions. In experiments using heterogeneous groups of agents, both sets of norms were susceptible to the free-rider effect. However, the gains of the less responsible agents were minimal, suggesting that agent designers would have little incentive to design agents that deviate from the standard level of responsibility to the group.

315,Finding friend and foe in multi-agent games [arXiv],2019,"Recent breakthroughs in AI for multi-agent games like Go, Poker, and Dota, have seen great strides in recent years. Yet none of these games address the real-life challenge of cooperation in the presence of unknown and uncertain teammates. This challenge is a key game mechanism in hidden role games. Here we develop the DeepRole algorithm, a multi-agent reinforcement learning agent that we test on The Resistance: Avalon, the most popular hidden role game. DeepRole combines counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) with deep value networks trained through self-play. Our algorithm integrates deductive reasoning into vector-form CFR to reason about joint beliefs and deduce partially observable actions. We augment deep value networks with constraints that yield interpretable representations of win probabilities. These innovations enable DeepRole to scale to the full Avalon game. Empirical game-theoretic methods show that DeepRole outperforms other hand-crafted and learned agents in five-player Avalon. DeepRole played with and against human players on the web in hybrid human-agent teams. We find that DeepRole outperforms human players as both a cooperator and a competitor.",,第3页.xls

Our goal is to introduce a new application area for software agents in Computer Supported Cooperative Work: the support of spatially distributed human-teams' cooperation within a virtual synchronous collaborative environment. Our work is motivated by a realistic problem: distance learning and education.

318,Effect of cooperative team size on coordination in adaptive multi-agent systems,2019,"In recent work, we utilized convergent cross mapping (CCM) to quantify coordination in a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) paradigm by measuring causal influence between pairs of agents in a joint task. CCM was originally developed to detect causal influences within ecological systems, and as we previously demonstrated, it can be used to measure causal dependencies between pairs of time-series data. While this work has provided important insight into the coordination between 2 teammates, it is not clear how such coordination scales with the number of agents working together with a shared goal. Within a predator-prey pursuit environment, the current study investigates the influence that an incremental increase in number of predator agents has on the inherently causal relationship between predators working together to pursue a single prey. We hypothesize that averaged CCM values will decrease with increasing number of predators due to a redistribution of coordination across all predator agents. This work provides a quantitative assessment for the fundamental influence that number of cooperative agents has on the causal relationship between agents working together on a joint task, and insight into coordinated group behaviors.",,第3页.xls
319,A theoretical framework on proactive information exchange in agent teamwork,2005,"Proactive information delivery is critical to achieving effective teamwork. However, existing theories do not adequately address proactive information delivery. This paper presents a formal framework for proactive information delivery in agent teamwork. First, the concept of information need is introduced. Second, a new modal operator, InfoNeed is used to represent information needs. The properties of the InfoNeed operator and its relationships to other mental modal operators are examined, four types of information needs are formally identified, and axioms for anticipating the information needs of other agents are proposed and justified. Third, the axiom characterizing chains of helpful behavior in large agent teams is given. Fourth, the semantics for two proactive communicative acts (ProInform and 3PTSubscribe) is given using a reformulation of the Cohen-Levesque semantics for communicative acts in terms of the SharedPlans formalism of Grosz and Kraus. The work in this paper not only provides a better understanding of the underlying assumptions required to justify proactive information delivery behavior, but also provides a coherent basis for the specification and design of agent teams with proactive information delivery capabilities.

320,The use of agents to represent learners in role-play training,2010,"This paper proposes the use of agents to involve learners in supporting online group work for the study of project management. Role-play training may be an appropriate tool for universities to use as an efficient alternative to on-the-job training (OJT) for project management education. However, we have found that because of the way that role-play exercises using an on-line group work training system in the project management course have operated, students have not been able to share the required information adequately with other students. In order to investigate the effectiveness of using an agent in role-play training, we have developed a role-play scenario so as to practice with agents. The results of analyzing the behavioral track record of each learner in a role-play exercise with agents are discussed. The results of a questionnaire survey taken among students who participated in a role-play exercise with agents indicate that the use of role-plays will enable them to learn human-related skills such as communication, leadership, and team building.",,第3页.xls

The first aim of our paper is to use Machine Learning techniques to obtain models of humans playing Robosoccer. These models can be used later to control a Robosoccer agent. However, models did not play as smoothly and optimally as the human.

The article focuses on decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) in cooperative MAS, where a team of independent learning robots (IL) try to coordinate their individual behavior to reach a coherent joint behavior. We assume that each robot has no information about its teammates' actions. To date, RL approaches for such ILs did not guarantee convergence to the optimal joint policy in scenarios where the coordination is difficult We report an investigation of existing algorithms for the learning of coordination in cooperative MAS, and suggest a Q-Learning extension for ILs, called Hysteretic Q-Learning. This algorithm does not require any additional communication between robots.

325,Development of a Computational Simulation Model for Conflict Management in Team Building,2011,"Conflict management is one of the most important issues in leveraging organizational competitiveness. However, traditional social scientists built theories or models in this area which were mostly expressed in words and diagrams are insufficient. Social science research based on computational modeling and simulation is beginning to augment traditional theory building. Simulation provides a method for people to try their actions out in a way that is cost effective, faster, appropriate, flexible, and ethical. In this paper, a computational simulation model for conflict management in team building is presented. The model is designed and used to explore the individual performances related to the combination of individuals who have a range of conflict handling styles, under various types of resources and policies. The model is developed based on agent-based modeling method. Each of the agents has one of the five conflict handling styles: accommodation, compromise, competition, contingency, and learning. There are three types of scenarios: normal, convex, and concave. There are two types of policies: no policy, and a reward and punishment policy. Results from running the model are also presented. The simulation has led us to derive two implications concerning conflict management. First, a concave type of resource promotes competition, while convex type of resource promotes compromise and collaboration. Second, the performance ranking of different styles can be influenced by introducing different policies. On the other hand, it is possible for us to promote certain style by introducing different policies.",,第3页.xls
326,Taming teams with mind changes,2008,"This paper is concerned with the algorithmic learning where the learner is allowed to make a finite but bounded number of mind changes. Briefly, in our learning paradigm, a learner is given examples from a recursive function, which the learner attempts to learn by producing programs to compute that function. We say that a team is successful if at least one member of the team learns the target function. The problem, given two teams with bounded number of mind changes whether, one team can provably learn more than the other team, was first proposed by Smith [C.H. Smith, The power of pluralism for automatic program synthesis, J. Assoc. Comput. Mach. 29 (1982) 1144-1165]. This problem has been open for the last twenty five years. This paper makes progress toward a complete solution of this problem. In the case of error-free learning, this paper closes the gap between the lower and the upper bounds. Finally, in the case of EX learning our result shows that there is no team with a >= 0 mind changes whose learning power is exactly equal to a single learner with bounded b (not equal a) number of mind changes. In the case of Popperian learning (PEX) we have a positive answer. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls
327,Nonconvex distributed feedback optimization for aggregative cooperative robotics,2024,"Distributed aggregative optimization is a recently emerged framework in which the agents of a network want to minimize the sum of local objective functions, each one depending on the agent decision variable (e.g., the local position of a team of robots) and an aggregation of all the agents' variables (e.g., the team barycenter). In this paper, we address a distributed feedback optimization framework in which agents implement a local (distributed) policy to reach a steady-state minimizing an aggregative cost function. We propose AGGREGATIVE TRACKING FEEDBACK, i.e., a novel distributed feedback optimization law in which each agent combines a closed-loop gradient flow with a consensus-based dynamic compensator reconstructing the missing global information. By using tools from system theory, we prove that AGGREGATIVE TRACKING FEEDBACK steers the network to a stationary point of an aggregative optimization problem with (possibly) nonconvex objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on a multi-robot surveillance scenario. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

329,Cooperative Decentralized Multi-agent Control under Local LTL Tasks and Connectivity Constraints,2014,"We propose a framework for the decentralized control of a team of agents that are assigned local tasks expressed as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. Each local LTL task specification captures both the requirements on the respective agent's behavior and the requests for the other agents' collaborations needed to accomplish the task. Furthermore, the agents are subject to communication constraints. The presented solution follows the automata-theoretic approach to LTL model checking, however, it avoids the computationally demanding construction of synchronized product system between the agents. A decentralized coordination scheme through a dynamic leader selection is proposed, to guarantee the low-level connectivity maintenance and a progress towards the satisfaction of each agent's task.",,第3页.xls
330,Effects of Shared Perception on the Evolution of Squad Behaviors,2009,"As the nonplayable characters (NPCs) of squad-based shooter computer games share a common goal, they should work together in teams and display cooperative behaviors that are tactically sound. Our research examines genetic programming (GP) as a technique to automatically develop effective squad behaviors for shooter games. GP has been used to evolve teams capable of defeating a single powerful enemy agent in a number of environments without the use of any explicit team communication. This paper is an extension of our paper presented at the 2008 Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE'08). Its aim is to explore the effects of shared perception on the evolution of effective squad behaviors. Thus, NPCs are given the ability to explicitly communicate their perceived information during evolution. The results show that the explicit communication of perceived information between team members enables an improvement in average team effectiveness.",,第3页.xls
331,Constructionist design methodology for interactive intelligences,2004,"We present a methodology for designing and implementing interactive intelligences. The constritctionist design methodology (CDM)-so called because it advocates modular building blocks and incorporation of prior work-addresses factors that we see as key to future advances in At, including support for interdisciplinary collaboration, coordination of teams, and large-scale systems integration.We test the methodology by building an interactive multifunctional system with a real-time perception-action loop. The system, whose construction relied entirely on the methodology, consists of an embodied virtual agent that can perceive both real and virtual objects in an augmented-reality room and interact with a user through coordinated gestures and speech. Wireless tracking technologies give the agent awareness of the environment and the user's speech and communicative acts. User and agent can communicate about things in the environment, their placement, and their function, as well as about more abstract topics, such as current news, through situated multimodal dialogue.The results demonstrate the CDM's strength in simplifying the modeling of complex, Multifunctional systems that require architectural experimentation and exploration of unclear subsystem boundaries, undefined variables, and tangled data flow and control hierarchies.",,第3页.xls

By using a cooperation mechanism among the management agent, the cooperation computing agent, the communication agent and the cooperation computing team, the DPC process were studied. Based on the state of computer, such as main state, redundancy state and failure state, dynamic resource partition and grid computing process were described.

334,Agent community extraction for 2D-RoboSoccer,2006,"Agents perform tasks to maximize their benefits. There are several instances where the agent can not perform a task individually. In these situations, agents need to cooperate and coordinate with other agents effectively and efficiently to maximize their benefits in a limited time. In several domains, we can analyze the behavior of successful agents and the way they interact with other agents forming strong communities or coalitions. This knowledge can be used by a new or unsuccessful agent to collaborate with other agents that gives maximum benefit under strict time constraints. This paper proposes a generic procedure for, extracting these hidden communities that can be used by the agents in a productive manner.

Distributed algorithm for mobile agents is designed to yield equal workload in each subregion by partitioning the entire region. Due to the uncertainty in the region, the agents do not have the total environment information. Instead, they have to update their trajectories in real time when they move forward in order to guarantee accurate workload partition and minimize the time to complete the dynamic coverage. With the help of input-to-state stability, we give the partitioning error estimation for the given algorithm. Then simulation results verify the feasibility of the distributed algorithm.",,第3页.xls
336,Partial local FriendQ multiagent learning: Application to team automobile coordination problem,2006,"Real world multiagent coordination problems are important issues for reinforcement learning techniques. In general, these problems are partially observable and this characteristic makes the solution computation intractable. Most of the existing approaches calculate exact or approximate solutions using the world model for only one agent. To handle a special case of partial observability, this article presents an approach to approximate the policy measuring a degree of observability for pure cooperative vehicle coordination problem. We compare empirically the performance of the learned policy for totally observable problems and performances of policies for different degrees of observability. If each degree of observability is associated with communication costs, multiagent system designers are able to choose a compromise between the performance of the policy and the cost to obtain the associated degree of observability of the problem. Finally, we show how the available space, surrounding an agent, influence the required degree of observability for near-optimal solution.",,第3页.xls

This article describes recent advancements in developing a new interface paradigm that will support human-autonomy teaming for air, ground, and surface (sea craft) UVs in defence of a military base. Several concise and integrated candidate control station interfaces are described by which the operator determines the role of autonomy in UV management using an adaptable automation control scheme. An extended play calling based control approach is used to support human-autonomy communication and teaming in managing how UV assets respond to potential threats (e.g. asset allocation, routing, and execution details). The design process for the interfaces is also described including: analysis of a base defence scenario used to guide this effort, consideration of ecological interface design constructs, and generation of UV and task-related pictorial symbology.",,第3页.xls
338,Hierarchical planning-based crowd formation,2019,"Team formation with realistic crowd simulation behavior is a challenge in computer graphics, multiagent control, and social simulation. In this study, we propose a framework of crowd formation via hierarchical planning, which includes cooperative-task, coordinated-behavior, and action-control planning. In cooperative-task planning, we improve the grid potential field to achieve global path planning for a team. In coordinated-behavior planning, we propose a time-space table to arrange behavior scheduling for a movement. In action-control planning, we combine the gaze-movement angle model and fuzzy logic control to achieve agent action. Our method has several advantages. (1) The hierarchical architecture is guaranteed to match the human decision process from high to low intelligence. (2) The agent plans his behavior only with the local information of his neighbor; the global intelligence of the group emerges from these local interactions. (3) The time-space table fully utilizes three-dimensional information. Our method is verified using crowds of various densities, from sparse to dense, employing quantitative performance measures. The approach is independent of the simulation model and can be extended to other crowd simulation tasks.",,第3页.xls

340,The Benefit of Ambiguity in Understanding Goals in Requirements Modelling,2011,"This paper examines the benefit of ambiguity in describing goals in requirements modelling for the design of socio-technical systems using concepts from Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) and ethnographic and cultural probe methods from Human Computer Interaction (HCI). The authors 'aim of their research is to create technologies that support more flexible and meaningful social interactions, by combining best practice in software engineering with ethnographic techniques to model complex social interactions from their socially oriented life for the purposes of building rich socio-technological systems. Currently social needs are modelled as coordinative and collaborative goals; however the domestic space surfaces a range of purely communicative activities, which are not calculated to serve any external productive purpose (i.e., it is communication often for the sake of pleasure).The authors use a holistic approach to eliciting, analyzing, and modelling socially-oriented requirements by combining a particular form of ethnographic technique, cultural probes, with Agent Oriented Software Engineering notations to model these requirements. This paper focuses on examining the value of maintaining ambiguity in the process of elicitation and analysis through the use of empirically informed quality goals attached to functional goals. The authors demonstrate the benefit of articulating a quality goal without turning it into a functional goal. Their study shows that quality goals kept at a high level of abstraction, ambiguous and open for conversations through the modelling process add richness to goal models, and communicate quality attributes of the interaction being modelled to the design phase, where this ambiguity is regarded as a resource for design.",,第3页.xls

We model this scenario by an influence game, a cooperative simple game in which a team (or coalition) of players succeeds if it is able to convince enough agents to participate in the task (to vote in favor of a decision). We take the linear threshold model as the influence model. We show first the expressiveness of influence games showing that they capture the class of simple games. Then we characterize the computational complexity of various problems on influence games, including measures (length and width), values (Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf) and properties (of teams and players). Finally, we analyze those problems for some particular extremal cases, with respect to the propagation of influence, showing tighter complexity characterizations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In order to further this research, we have developed an inexpensive autonomous robot platform, the Minnow. The CMU Hammerhead robot soccer team competes in the middle-size RoboCup competition using four of these Minnow robots. The challenges of robot soccer require the robot players both to be individually capable and also to work together with their teammates. Some of the research areas which have been furthered by our work in robot soccer include color vision, multiagent sensor fusion, cooperative behaviors, and communication in noisy low-bandwidth environments. The 2001 CMU Hammerheads represent the evolution of the previous year's team, using largely the same hardware and software architecture. The major changes in hardware are increases in processor speed and memory, and a change to digital cameras. On the software side, most of the low-level behaviors from the 2000 team are retained, and the emphasis has been on refining high-level behaviors and improving coordination and teamwork.

343,The complexity of multi-agent plan recognition,2015,"Multi-agent plan recognition (MAPR) seeks to identify the dynamic team structures and team plans from observations of the action sequences of a set of intelligent agents, based on a library of known team plans (plan library), and an evaluation function. It has important applications in decision support, team work, analyzing data from automated monitoring, surveillance, and intelligence analysis in general. We introduce a general model for MAPR that accommodates different representations of the plan library, and includes single agent plan recognition as a special case. Thus it provides an ideal substrate to investigate and contrast the complexities of single and multi-agent plan recognition. Using this model we generate theoretical insights on hardness, with practical implications. A key feature of these results is that they are baseline, i.e., the polynomial solvability results are given in terms of a compact and expressive plan language (context free language), while the hardness results are given in terms of a less compact language. Consequently the hardness results continue to hold in virtually all realistic plan languages, while the polynomial solvability results extend to the subsets of the context free plan language. In particular, we show that MAPR is in P (polynomial in the size of the plan library and the observation trace) if the number of agents is fixed (in particular 1) but NP-complete otherwise. If the number of agents is a variable, then even the one step MAPR problem is NP-complete. While these results pertain to abduction, we also investigate a related question: adaptation, i.e., the problem of refining the evaluation function based on feedback. We show that adaptation is also NP-hard for a variable number of agents, but easy for a single agent. These results establish a clear distinction between the hardnesses of single and multi-agent plan recognition even in idealized settings, indicating the necessity of a fundamentally different set of techniques for the latter.",,第3页.xls

This paper proposes a new framework for developing autonomous and interactive software agent systems. It customizes the BDI (belief, desire, intension) model to define a so-called DIBRA (desire-intention-belief-rapport-adaptation) as a generic method to support the software process development of multiagent systems (MAS), and progress from individual autonomous agent concept towards interactive multiple agents. The methodology serves for mastering the complexity and the difficulty of setting up effective autonomous interactive MAS.

347,Automated support for human mixed initiative decision and control,2003,"We describe a collaborative multi-agent system that uses a dynamic, model-based representation of a control system to provide a substrate for multiple software and human agents. This representation provides the semantics for a set of software agents that dynamically manage the human-machine dialog as it evolves with the situation. The interface design agents use model-based productive reasoning about situations and interaction design, and create specialized user interfaces that meet the current interaction needs of the user. We are successfully applying this approach in the domain of mixed-initiative command and control of teams of semi-autonomous vehicles. We have found that the combination of a productive modeling approach to basic reasoning on situations, together with the ability to synthesize user interfaces based on the state of a situation, provides the ability to automatically design useful interactions. User interface generation technology supports multi-agent systems that must accommodate varying levels of participant autonomy, particularly in dynamic situations with varying requirements for mixed-initiative control by human commanders.",,第3页.xls
348,An individualistic approach to social action in multi-agent system,1999,"We propose an individualistic formal model of coordination and social action in multi-agent systems (MAS). In the first stage, the agents recognize potential for cooperation by reasoning about how they depend on each other. In the second phase, the agents negotiate directly: following `social' strategies, the agents propose, accept or refuse different offers until they reach a `fair' agreement. The process itself is seen as an exchange of commissive speech acts, through which the agents adopt social commitments. Finally, joint commitments and societies are defined in individual terms. Joint plans are seen as deals and team activity as a special case of social activity. Moreover, agents are allowed to relax their initial goals and negotiate over compatible subgoals. They will cooperate as long as they have common interests. This approach improves previous models of coordination in three ways: (a) it is simpler, because team and plan formation are considered in the same stage; (b) it is clearer, because there are not representational gaps along the coordination process; (c) it is more comprehensive, because it is applicable to MAS in general, not only to cooperative problem solving (CPS).",,第3页.xls
349,Target localization using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization,2022,"Target localization refers to identifying a target location based on sensory data readings gathered by sensing agents (robots, UAVs), surveying a certain area of interest. Existing solutions either rely on estimating the target location through fusion and analysis of the collected sensory data, or on predefined and data-driven survey paths. However, the adaptability of such methods remains an issue, as increasing the complexity and the dynamicity of the environment requires further re-modeling and supervision. As an efficient and adaptable approach to obtain localization agents, this work proposes several Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MDRL) models to tackle the target localization problem in multi-agent systems. The use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) helps in providing an efficient Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm to obtain intelligent agents, which can learn in different complex environments. In this work, an actor-critic structure is used with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Agents' observations are modeled as 2D heatmaps capturing locations and sensor readings of all agents. Cooperation among agents is induced using a team-based reward, which incentivizes agents to cooperate in localizing the target and managing their resources. Scalability with the number of agents is ensured through the use of a Centralized Learning for Decentralized Execution approach, while scalability with the observation size is achieved through image downsampling and Gaussian filters. The efficiency of the proposed models is validated and further benchmarked against existing target localization methods, through experiments on single- and multi-agent systems, for tasks pertaining to radioactive target localization.

351,Collaborative recognition-primed decision model used in agent based battle simulation,2009,"There has been much research investigating team cognition, naturalistic decision making, and collaborative technology as it relates to real world or complex domains of practice (battle simulation). However, there has been limited work in incorporating naturalistic decision making models for supporting distributed collaborative agent decision making, and the demand of a collaborative NMD decision model is critical for the battle simulation. The aim of this research is to simulate engaged sides' decision making using a collaborative RPD (recognition-primed decision model). By extending Klein's RPD, a collaborative SRPD model was proposed and used in multi-agent system. This model establishes a basis for developing agent architectures that support collaborations in developing shared situation awareness and in making decisions based on progressively refined recognitions. The simulation indicates that by introducing a collaborative SRPD model to multi-agent system, collaborative SRPD agents can effectively response to complex situations and cooperate with teammate.",,第3页.xls
352,Forecasting Evolution of Clusters in Game Agents with Hebbian Learning,2023,"Large multi-agent systems such as real-time strategy games are often driven by collective behavior of agents. For example, in StarCraft II, human players group spatially near agents into a team and control the team to defeat opponents. In this light, clustering the agents in the game has been used for various purposes such as the efficient control of the agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning and game analytic tools for the game users. However, despite the useful information provided by clustering, learning the dynamics of multi-agent systems at a cluster level has been rarely studied yet. In this paper, we present a hybrid AI model that couples unsupervised and self-supervised learning to forecast evolution of the clusters in StarCraft II. We develop an unsupervised Hebbian learning method in a set-to-cluster module to efficiently create a variable number of the clusters with lower inference time complexity than K-means clustering. Also, a long short-term memory based prediction module is designed to recursively forecast state vectors generated by the set-to-cluster module to define cluster configuration. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed model successfully predicts complex movement of the clusters in the game.",,第3页.xls

354,Demand-Driven Transparency for Monitoring Intelligent Agents,2020,"In autonomous multiagent or multirobotic systems, the ability to quickly and accurately respond to threats and uncertainties is important for both mission outcomes and survivability. Such systems are never truly autonomous, often operating as part of a human-agent team. Artificial intelligent agents (IAs) have been proposed as tools to help manage such teams; e.g., proposing potential courses of action to human operators. However, they are often underutilized due to a lack of trust. Designing transparent agents, who can convey at least some information regarding their internal reasoning processes, is considered an effective method of increasing trust. How people interact with such transparency information to gain situation awareness while avoiding information overload is currently an unexplored topic. In this article, we go part way to answering this question, by investigating two forms of transparency: sequential transparency, which requires people to step through the IA's explanation in a fixed order; and demand-driven transparency, which allows people to request information as needed. In an experiment using a multivehicle simulation, our results show that demand-driven interaction improves the operators' trust in the system while maintaining, and at times improving, performancehttp://www.ieee.org/documents/taxonomy_v101.pdf.?> and usability.",,第3页.xls

356,Simultaneous fault detection and consensus control design for a network of multi-agent systems,2016,"The problem of simultaneous fault detection and consensus control (SFDCC) of linear continuous-time multi-agent systems is addressed in this paper. A mixed H-infinity/H- formulation of the SFDCC problem is presented and distributed detection filters are designed using only relative output information among the agents. With our proposed methodology, all agents reach either a state consensus or a model reference consensus while simultaneously collaborate with one another to detect the occurrence of faults in the team. Indeed, each agent not only can detect its own fault but also is capable of detecting its neighbor's faults. It is shown that through a decomposition approach the computational complexity of solving the distributed problem is significantly reduced as compared to an optimal centralized solution. The extended linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are used to reduce the conservativeness of the SFDCC results by introducing additional matrix variables to eliminate the couplings of Lyapunov matrices with the system matrices. It is shown that under a special condition on the network topology the faulty agent can be isolated in the team. Simulation results corresponding to a team of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (AUVs) demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed design methodology.

357,New views on treatment of aromatase inhibitors induced arthralgia,2010,"Background: Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) induced arthralgia is one of the most frequent side effects in breast cancer hormonal therapy, which may become severe in some cases affecting patients' quality of life. The purpose of this study is to investigate alternative treatment of arthralgia, as current treatment options may often prove to be inadequate.Material-methods: According to Morales et al, AI-associated arthralgia syndrome is characterized by tenosynovial changes in MRI, including fluid in tendon sheaths and joints. Initially, furosemide (20 mg per two days) was prescribed by our team, in order to minimize peripheral edema in women receiving aromatase inhibitors. The data collected demonstrated that 16 out of 18 patients had benefited from the addition of a diuretic agent in their adjuvant AI treatment as far as AI induced arthralgia is concerned as well. In this retrospective study, data from 288 women receiving an AI for non-metastatic breast cancer are analyzed in order to define whether chronic diuretic therapy could affect the impact of arthralgia on those patients.Results: 42/288 Patients were receiving chronic diuretic therapy for heart disease or hypertension (Group A), while 246/288 patients had never received any diuretic medication (Group B). At 43.03 months of mean follow up, in Group A arthralgia was developed in 3/42 patients (6.97%) as opposed to 39/246 patients in Group B (15.85%) - p value: 0.01. Other parameters that could affect the impact of arthralgia in both Groups are also analyzed and taken under consideration.Conclusion: Despite the low number of patients and the retrospective nature of the study, there was a clear trend to a lower incidence of arthralgia in patients receiving chronic diuretic therapy. We believe that based on this hypothesis generating study further research should be done to assess the value of diuretic agents in the treatment of AI-associated arthralgia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

358,Deep Teams: Decentralized Decision Making With Finite and Infinite Number of Agents,2020,"Inspired by the concepts of deep learning in artificial intelligence and fairness in behavioral economics, we introduce deep teams in this article. In such systems, agents are partitioned into a few subpopulations so that the dynamics and cost of agents in each subpopulation is invariant to the indexing of agents. The goal of agents is to minimize a common cost function in such a manner that the agents in each subpopulation are not discriminated or privileged by the way they are indexed. Two nonclassical information structures are studied. In the first one, each agent observes its local state as well as the empirical distribution of the states of agents in each subpopulation, called deep state, whereas in the second one, the deep states of a subset (possibly all) of subpopulations are not observed. Novel dynamic programs are developed to identify globally optimal and suboptimal solutions for the first and second information structures, respectively. The computational complexity of finding the optimal solution in both space and time is polynomial (rather than exponential) with respect to the number of agents in each subpopulation and is linear (rather than exponential) with respect to the control horizon. This complexity is further reduced in time by introducing a forward equation, which we call deep Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, described by multiple convolutional layers of binomial probability distributions. Two different prices are defined for computation and communication, and it is shown that under mild conditions they converge to zero as the number of quantization levels and the number of agents tend to infinity. In addition, the main results are extended to infinite-horizon discounted models and arbitrarily asymmetric cost functions. Finally, a service management example with 200 users is presented.",,第3页.xls

Whereas virtual environments have become prominent tools in many domains, offering shared and interactive virtual worlds, the proposed prototype incorporates multi-user and interactive functionalities together with a new agent, namely, a physical robot and its digital twin. The physical robot is located and acts in a real environment whilst its avatar (further referred to as its digital twin) lives in the virtual world. The users are able to see and explore both worlds simultaneously through the 'eyes' of the robot.

In this context, of interest are cognitive architectures that offer the ability to integrate other models including themselves. The purpose of this work is to develop and test a model of management of a team of intelligent agents actors, based on a system of incentives and goals. To test the idea, we use the agent management mechanism as well as the ability of a cognitive system to adapt to coordination of a group of people. We study not only the overall performance of the concept and its effectiveness in comparison with analogues, but also the prospects of using it over time to manage people in real world situations. It is expected that the usage of this system to coordinate a team of people will increase the team efficiency compared to their own coordination. The paradigm used in this study is a capture-the-flag game with a messaging system built into it. For testing the model, group matches were organized among participants. The collected data was sufficient to prove the concept. The study showed that the implemented coordinator prototype is potentially capable of improving performance of a group of people in the selected paradigm. This article describes the principles underlying the system and methods used for their implementation. Preliminary results suggest that the approach is promising and should be further investigated.

While plan diagnosis is able to capture the distinction between primary and secondary failures, the agent diagnosis makes apparent the actual health status of the agents.The paper presents a mechanism of failure propagation which captures the interplay between agent diagnosis and plan diagnosis; this mechanism plays a critical role in the understanding at what extent a fault affecting the functionalities of an agent affects the global plan too.

367,Extending self-organizing particle systems to problem solving,2004,"Self-organizing particle systems consist of numerous autonomous, purely reflexive agents (particles) whose collective movements through space are determined primarily by local influences they exert upon one another. Inspired by biological phenomena (bird flocking, fish schooling, etc.), particle systems have been used not only for biological modeling, but also increasingly for applications requiring the simulation of collective movements such as computer-generated animation. In this research, we take some first steps in extending particle systems so that they not only move collectively, but also solve simple problems. This is done by giving the individual particles (agents) a rudimentary intelligence in the form of a very limited memory and a top-down, goal-directed control mechanism that, triggered by appropriate conditions, switches them between different behavioral states and thus different movement dynamics. Such enhanced particle systems are shown to be able to function effectively in performing simulated search-and-collect tasks. Further, computational experiments show that collectively moving agent teams are more effective than similar but independently moving ones in carrying out such tasks, and that agent teams of either type that split off members of the collective to protect previously acquired resources are most effective. This work shows that the reflexive agents of contemporary particle systems can readily be extended to support goal-directed problem solving while retaining their collective movement behaviors. These results may prove useful not only for future modeling of animal behavior, but also in computer animation, coordinated movement control in robotic teams, particle swarm optimization, and computer games.",,第3页.xls

370,Applying max-sum to teams of mobile sensing agents,2018,"Multi-agent applications that include teams of mobile sensing agents are challenging since they are inherently dynamic and a single movement of a mobile sensor can change the problem that the entire team is facing. A variation of the Distributed Constraint Optimization model for Mobile Sensor Teams (DCOP_MST) was previously adjusted to represent such problems along with local search algorithms that were enhanced with exploration methods. This paper considers the use of the Max-sum algorithm for solving problems of deploying a mobile sensor team in an unknown environment to track and monitor points of interest (targets), represented by the DCOPMST model.The DCOP_MST model allows the representation of different functions for aggregating the joint coverage of targets by multiple sensors. The use of different functions has a dramatic effect on the complexity of the Max-sum algorithm. When using cardinality functions, Max-sum can be performed efficiently regardless of the arity of constraints. When Max-sum is used to solve applications that require other (more complex) aggregation functions, its complexity is exponential in the arity of the constraints and thus, its usefulness is limited.In this paper we investigate the performance of the Max-sum algorithm on two implementations of the DCOPMST model. Each implementation considers a different joint credibility function for determining the coverage for each target, with respect to the locations and the credibility of agents. In the first, the coverage is calculated according to the number of agents that are located within sensing range from the target. This function can be calculated efficiently. The second takes the angle between the lines of sight of different agents to a target into consideration. The larger the difference in the angle between the lines of sight, the higher the coverage efficiency.We analyze the challenges in adjusting the Max-sum algorithm in both scenarios and propose enhancements of the algorithm that make it more efficient. We provide empirical evidence of the advantages resulting from these enhancements in comparison to the naive algorithm.",,第3页.xls

In this paper, we contribute to this research stream by presenting a simple genetic algorithm with lexicographic ranking (GALR) for the optimization of flocking strategy-based ghost controllers. Flocking strategies are a paradigm for intelligent agents characterized by showing emergent behavior and for having very little computational and memory requirements, making them well suited for commercial applications and mobile devices.

372,"A Unifying Framework for Formal Theories of Novelty:Framework, Examples and Discussion [arXiv]",2020,"Managing inputs that are novel, unknown, or out-of-distribution is critical as an agent moves from the lab to the open world. Novelty-related problems include being tolerant to novel perturbations of the normal input, detecting when the input includes novel items, and adapting to novel inputs. While significant research has been undertaken in these areas, a noticeable gap exists in the lack of a formalized definition of novelty that transcends problem domains. As a team of researchers spanning multiple research groups and different domains, we have seen, first hand, the difficulties that arise from ill-specified novelty problems, as well as inconsistent definitions and terminology. Therefore, we present the first unified framework for formal theories of novelty and use the framework to formally define a family of novelty types. Our framework can be applied across a wide range of domains, from symbolic AI to reinforcement learning, and beyond to open world image recognition. Thus, it can be used to help kick-start new research efforts and accelerate ongoing work on these important novelty-related problems.

While there have been many successful ML applications to portions of the robotic soccer task, it appears to be still beyond the capabilities of modern machine learning techniques to enable a team of 11 agents to successfully learn the full robotic soccer task from sensors to actuators. Since the successful applications to portions of the task have been embedded in different teams and are often addressed different subtasks, they have been difficult to compare. We put forth keepaway soccer as a domain suitable for directly comparing different machine learning approaches to robotic soccer. It is complex enough that it cannot be solved trivially, yet simple enough that complete machine learning approaches are feasible. In keepaway, one team, the keepers, tries to keep control of the ball for as long as possible despite the efforts of the takers. The keepers learn individually when to hold the ball and when to pass it to a teammate, while the takers learn when to charge the ball-holder and when to cover possible passing lanes.

374,Multi-Agent Autonomous Battle Management Using Deep Neuroevolution,2021,"Next-generation autonomous vehicles will require a level of team coordination that cannot be achieved using traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning algorithms or Machine Learning (ML) algorithms alone. We present a method for controlling teams of military aircraft in air battle applications by using a novel combination of deep neuroevolution with an allocation- based task assignment algorithm. We describe the neuroevolution techniques that enable a deep neural network to evolve an effective policy, including a novel mutation operator that enhances the stability of the evolution process. We also compare this new method to policy gradient Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques that we have utilized in previous work, and explain why neuroevolution presents several benefits in this particular application domain. The key analytical result is that neuroevolution makes it easier to select long sequences of actions following a consistent pattern, such as a continuous turning maneuver that occurs frequently in air engagements. We additionally describe multiple ways in which this neuroevolution approach can be integrated with allocation algorithms such as the KuhnMunkres Hungarian algorithm. We explain why gradient-free methods are particularly amenable to this hybrid approach and open up exciting new algorithmic possibilities. Since neuroevolution requires thousands of training episodes, we also describe an asynchronous parallelization scheme that yields order of magnitude speedup by evaluating multiple individuals from the evolving population simultaneously. Our deep neuroevolution approach out-performs human-programmed AI opponents with a win rate greater than 80% in multi-agent Beyond Visual Range air engagement simulations developed using AFSIM.",,第3页.xls

380,Goals are Enough: Inducing AdHoc cooperation among unseen Multi-Agent systems in IMFs,2024,"Intent-based management will play a critical role in achieving customers' expectations in the next-generation mobile networks. Traditional methods cannot perform efficient resource management since they tend to handle each expectation independently. Existing approaches, e.g., based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) allocate resources in an efficient fashion when there are conflicting expectations on the network slice. However, in reality, systems are often far more complex to be addressed by a standalone MARL formulation. Often there exists a hierarchical structure of intent fulfillment where multiple pre-trained, self-interested agents may need to be further orchestrated by a supervisor or controller agent. Such agents may arrive in the system adhoc, which then needs to be orchestrated along with other available agents. This is especially true for networks evolving with time as components can get added incrementally. Retraining the whole system every time is often infeasible given the associated time and cost. Given the challenges, such adhoc coordination of pre-trained systems could be achieved through an intelligent supervisor agent which incentivizes pre-trained RL/MARL agents through sets of dynamic contracts (goals or bonuses) and encourages them to act as a cohesive unit towards fulfilling a global expectation. Some approaches use a rule-based supervisor agent and deploy the hierarchical constituent agents sequentially, based on human-coded rules.In the current work, we propose a framework whereby pre-trained agents can be orchestrated in parallel leveraging an AI-based supervisor agent. For this, we propose to use Adhoc-Teaming approaches which assign optimal goals to the MARL agents and incentivize them to exhibit certain desired behaviours. Results on the network emulator show that the proposed approach results in faster and improved fulfilment of expectations when compared to rule-based approaches and even generalizes to changes in environments.",,第3页.xls

The advantage of this control scheme is that it reduces the tracking errors and improves the robustness of the team cohesion to followers' faults. The results of simulation are provided to illustrate that information feedback can improve the performance of the system.",,第3页.xls
383,Towards a life-long learning soccer agent,2003,"One problem in robotic soccer (and in robotics in general) is to adapt skills and the overall behavior to a changing environment and to hardware improvements. We applied hierarchical reinforcement learning in an SMDP framework learning on all levels simultaneously. As our experiments show, learning simultaneously on the skill level and on the skill selection level is advantageous since it allows for a smooth adaption to a changing environment. Furthermore, the skills we trained turn also out to be quite competitive when run on the real robotic players of the players of our CS Freiburg team.",,第3页.xls
384,Group decision-making in customer-centered software design,1996,"Customer-centred software design is an approach in which a team uses deep insights of the customer to work towards usability and social acceptance in addition to functional competence of the final software. The heterogeneous nature of design teams in customer-centred approaches raises the need to manage the different viewpoints that persistently exist among team members. In providing this ability, we challenge the necessity of homogeneity (i.e. that team members need to share a common viewpoint, that requirements need to be unambiguously defined and that a software design needs to be internally consistent). Our research hypothesis is that usability and acceptability are related to the ability to change and adapt (plasticity, robustness) and to encompass multiple points of view (coherence) while increasing communication across viewpoints. Our research project is about the development of a method of customer-centred software design and its supporting tools. In this article, we discuss a multi-agent architecture for design support tools. It is emphasized how key design decisions underlying this architecture enable and stimulate group decision-making in a heterogeneous design team while supporting robustness, coherence and plasticity.",,第3页.xls
385,Agent-development framework based on modular structure to research disaster-relief activities,2018,"This article describes approaches to the RoboCup Rescue Simulation league which is a part of the response to recent large-scale natural disasters. In particular, the project provides a platform for studying disaster-relief agents and simulations. The aim of the project is to contribute to society is by making widely available the findings our research into disaster relief. Some disaster-relief agents contain excellent algorithm modules, which should ideally be shareable among developers. However, this is hindered when the program structure of the agents are different among different teams. Therefore, this article designs and implements a modular agent-development framework that unifies the structure within RoboCup Rescue Simulation agents to facilitate such technical exchange.",,第3页.xls
386,Should Agents Have Two Systems to Track Beliefs and Belief-Like States?,2022,"Adult humans are typically capable of impressive, often recursive, reasoning about the mental states of others, but recent evidence has suggested that said reasoning, called Theory of Mind reasoning (ToM), is not easy or automatic. This has lead to the theory that human ToM reasoning requires two systems. One system, efficient but inflexible, enables rapid judgements by operating without explicit modeling of beliefs, while a separate, effortful system, enables richer predictions over more complex belief encodings. We argue that computational ToM requires a similar distinction. However, we propose a different model: a single process, but with effortful re-representation leading to two phases of ToM reasoning. Efficient reasoning, in our view, occurs over representations that include actions, but not necessarily explicit belief states. Effortful reasoning, then, involves re-representation of these initial encodings in order to handle errors, resolve real-world conflicts, and fully account for others' belief states. We present an implemented computational model, based in memory retrieval and structural alignment, and discuss possible implications for computational agents in human-machine teams.",,第3页.xls
387,"An agent based peer-to-peer network with thesaurus based searching, and load balancing",2005,"This paper describes a search mechanism for files in an unstructured peer-to-peer network. Most of the existing P2P architectures cannot autonomously locate services on the P2P network. Peers can hardly work and cooperate as a team. Using well-designed agents can improve the efficiency of the operations and data communication in the P2P applications. In the proposed system, agents are residing on peers and almost take care of every thing. They receive a problem from the user or other agents, send each job to the responsible agents and merge the sub-solution gathered from them to present a final solution. The communication among nodes takes place through mobile agents. The key features include content matching, parallel downloads, agent based load balancing and thesaurus based searching.",,第3页.xls
388,A framework for distributed agent-based engineering design support,2001,"Concurrent engineering draws together team working and cooperation, with the aim of reducing the need for costly design modifications in the later stages of design and product development. However, the complexities arising in the process of design, in general, defy formal analysis and computational support is required. In providing intelligent computational support for concurrent engineering, a combination of various problem-solving strategies may be required for complex design situations. It is proposed that an appropriate model for such provision is in the form of a set of interacting autonomous intelligent agents, possessing different problem-solving capabilities and differing degrees of intelligence. The requirements for such agent-based design support are discussed and possibilities for its realisation, with the aid of Web technology, in a distributed design environment are explored.

391,Modeling Team Interaction and Decision-Making in Agile Human-Machine Teams: Quantum and Dynamical Systems Perspective,2023,"In this study, we define team agility as a function of exploration and exploitation of team coordination. Based on these two coordination concepts, we examined interactive decision-making in a dynamic task environment by applying: first, the principles of quantum cognition for the decision-making processes at the confluence of teamwork and taskwork (to discern the effects of ontic uncertainty for each human team member in the case of having incomplete teamwork) and second, nonlinear dynamical systems modeling for the teamwork (to capture epistemic uncertainty). In this study, there were the following three conditions based on manipulation of the pilot role: first, synthetic condition-the pilot role was played by a synthetic agent, second, control condition-it was a randomly assigned participant, and third, experimenter condition-it was an expert who used a role-specific coordination script. Overall findings indicate that when teams in the experimenter condition come across the targets, they tend to explore alternatives by coordinating as a team rather than exploiting existing team strategies, which may not work best for the situation at hand. In contrast, teams in control and synthetic conditions tended more toward exploitation than exploration in coordination. We consider this a sign of agility in teamwork.",,第3页.xls
392,Conceptual Design of A Multi-Agent System for Interconnected Power Systems Restoration,2012,"Outages and faults in interconnected power systems may cause cascading sequences of events, and catastrophic failures of power systems. How to efficiently manage power systems and restore the systems from faults is a challenging research issue in power engineering. Multi-agent systems are employed to address such a challenge in recent years. A centralized coordination strategy was firstly introduced to manage agents in a power system. Such a strategy usually adopts a single central coordinator to control the whole system for system management, maintenance, and restoration purposes. However, disadvantages such as deficiencies in robustness, openness, and flexibility prevent this strategy from extensive online applications. Consequently, a decentralized coordination strategy was proposed to overcome such limitations. But the decentralized coordination strategy cannot efficiently provide a global solution when serious faults spread out in a power system. In this paper, a conceptual multi-agent system design is introduced to express our proposal in power system modeling. A novel dynamic team forming mechanism is proposed to dynamically manage agents in power system with a flexible coordination structure, so as to balance the effectiveness and efficiency of the introduced multi-agent system. The results from simulations of case studies indicate the performance of the proposed multi-agent model.",,第3页.xls

394,Network decontamination from a black virus,2013,"In this paper, we consider the problem of decontaminating a network from a black virus (BV) using a team of mobile system agents. The BV is a harmful process which, like the extensively studied black hole (BH), destroys any agent arriving at the network site where it resides; when that occurs, unlike a black hole which is static by definition, a BV moves, spreading to all the neighboring sites, thus increasing its presence in the network. If however one of these sites contains a system agent, that clone of the BV is destroyed (i.e., removed permanently from the system). The initial location of the BV is unknown a priori. The objective is to permanently remove any presence of the BVfrom the network with minimum number of site infections (and thus casualties). The main cost measure is the total number of agents needed to solve the problem. This problem integrates in its definition both the harmful aspects of the classical black hole search problem (where however the dangerous elements are static) with the mobility aspects of the classical intruder capture or network decontamination problem(where however there is no danger for the agents). Thus, it is the first attempt to model mobile intruders harmful not only forth sites but also for the agents. We start the study of this problem by focusing on some important classes of interconnection networks: grids, tori, and hypercubes. For each class we present solution protocols and strategies for the team of agents, analyze their worst case complexity, and prove their optimality.",,第3页.xls
395,Task oriented functional self-organization of mobile agents team: Memory optimization based on correlation feature,2004,"We developed a new optimization algorithm for multiagent coordination based on indirect and unsupervised communication. The mobile agents team task is simply searching and collecting food items. The global coherent behavior is emergent, meaning that despite the fact that agents have no global map of the environment and do not directly communicate with each other they coordinate their behavior to achieve a global goal. The coordinated response of the agents is the result of indirect communication via local changes in the environment. Each agent records the encountered objects in a memory register and by appropriate weighting of local perception the agent tries to estimate the global spatial distributions of the objects in the environment. The range of spatial and temporal indirect coupling among the agents is controlled via a memory radius. We developed an optimized an algorithm that adapts the memory radius according to environment changes to minimize the computational time required to achieve the goal (piling the objects of the same kind together). Our optimization procedure is based on the correlation feature of the emergent pattern. The maximum speed of feature decreases leads to an optimized dependence of the memory radius on simulation time step. We derived also an analytic relationship between the memory radius and the time step based on the intermediate steady-state assumption. Numerical simulations confirmed that our analytic relationship coincides with the numerical optimization criterion based on the correlation feature.",,第3页.xls

399,Agent-based Inter-firm Collaborative Product Development for System-on-chip,2009,"System-on-chip (SoC) product development usually needs inter-firm collaboration and the design teams need to work closely with their customers and suppliers. With the product development time and product lifecycle getting shorter, effective collaborative practices become more critical. This paper explores the use of multi-agent technology to assist in the inter-firm collaborative product development and proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) framework to carry out the SoC product development. The result shows that the proposed multi-agent framework helps enhance the efficiency of communication and coordination. As a result, the constraint/rule based MAS system could shorten the development cycle time significantly while the design and resource constraints are evaluated and negotiated in-process. The system could provide an explicit series of audit trail to confirm knowledge exchange protocol in the multi-agent, inter-firm collaboration process.",,第3页.xls

In the scenario we consider, only the leaders are aware of the global mission, which is to converge to a known destination point. Thus, the objective of the leaders is to drag the team to the desired goal. In the paper we obtain bounds on the number of leaders needed to complete the task. The results are first established for an initially complete communication graph and then extended to the incomplete case. Computer simulations support the derived theory.",,第3页.xls

To this end, sociotechnological systems are conceptualized as problem solving systems that comprise human and technological agents engaged in dynamic collaboration. Following this, there is a discussion of the challenge of achieving agent coordination in problem solving systems as technological agents become increasingly autonomous. A key assertion is that agent coordination in problem solving systems might be enhanced through the study of competent coordination in living systems such as human and animal groups. Based on a review of research on competent coordination in human and animal groups, design principles for problem solving systems are then presented. Finally, methods are proposed for measuring the extent to which a given agent operates in accordance with these principles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls

There are three goals preset in our research, that is, robust individual behaviors, controllable cooperation and behavioral learning. The system is therefore required to collect data in real-time situations and repeat experiments accurately, which are found difficult to be achieved in pure physical or simulated case.

406,From Spoken Words to Prompt Triggers: Technical Iterations of a Semi-Intelligent Conversational Agent to Promote Early Literacy,2023,"AI technology is rapidly evolving and has vast potential for educational applications. This paper focuses on the technical iterations that took place as our project team developed a semi-intelligent conversational agent (CA) that uses speech recognition to fire spoken prompts to promote caregiver-child interaction as they read books aloud together. Situating this work in a design-based research methodology, the technical iterations reported here are part of the iterative build phase. (Easterday et al., 2018; Hoadley & Campos, 2022). The CA app promotes conversations between caregivers and children by listening to the human dyads as they read, matching their spoken words to marker words that would pinpoint the page of the storybook the dyads are reading, and playing a prompt corresponding to the page. The dynamic system that supports the app involves multiple components: web accessible services, data processing services, and human outputs, and it has gone through a combined seven iterations in three prototypes. Though a very small part of the DBR cycle, the technical iterations presented here have the potential to inform others interested in incorporating text-to-speech and other AI technologies into educational applications. We close with considerations for future directions.",,第3页.xls

The interaction was described to participants as a game with the goal of imitating the agent's slow upper-body movements, and where new subtle movements can be proposed by both the participant and the agent. As we are interested only in body movements, simple virtual agent was built and displayed at a local exhibition, and we asked visitors one by one to play the game. During the interaction, the agent's behaviour varied from subject to subject, and we observed their responses. Interesting observations have been drawn from the experiment and it seems that only a small variation in the agent's behaviour and synchronization can lead to a significantly different feel of the game in the participants.",,第3页.xls
408,Application of Java Serialization into JADE Agent Communication,2012,"Open systems consist of autonomous and heterogeneous agents who interact in order to exchange or negotiate information, knowledge, and services. The principal challenge in agent communication research is to enable flexible and efficient communication among agents. Jade follows FIPA standards so that ideally Jade agents could interact with agents written in other languages and running on other platforms. From the view of message content, there are three ways to implement communication between agents. This paper mainly did some research on how to implement communication between Jade agents using serialized Java objects. Serialization is Java's built-in mechanism for transforming an object graph into a series of bytes, which can then be sent over the network or stored in a file. The research relies on the Project Supported by Innovative Research Team in University of LiaoNing Province: Maritime search and rescue decision support system based on multi-agent. The results show that in a distributed network programming, particularly for transmitting complex objects in multi-agent systems, the use of object serialization is very flexible. But it is also very limited. It must store and retrieve the entire object graph at once, making it unsuitable for dealing with large amounts of data.",,第3页.xls

One feature of the proposed algorithm is that no active communication is needed, and as a result, the algorithm becomes advantageous in the application of robotic sensor networks where energy efficient algorithms are highly desirable to maximize network lifespan. The algorithm makes use of the Cayley-Menger determinant which is a powerful tool from distance geometry. It is shown that the proposed algorithm has the potential to be applied to robotic swarms in a challenging scenario where each robot is installed with only range sensors and cannot measure the position of a target directly.",,第3页.xls
410,Using a multi-agent Evidential Reasoning Network as the objective function for an Evolutionary Algorithm,2007,"A culturally diverse group of people are now participating in military multinational coalition operations (e.g., combined air operations center, training exercises such as Red Flag at Nellis AFB, NATO AWACS), as well as in extreme environments. Human biases and routines, capabilities, and limitations strongly influence overall system performance; whether during operations or simulations using models of humans. Many missions and environments challenge human capabilities (e.g., combat stress, waiting, fatigue from long duty hours or tour of duty). This paper presents a team selection algorithm based on an evolutionary algorithm. The main difference between this and the standard EA is that a new form of objective function is used that incorporates the beliefs and uncertainties of the data. Preliminary results show that this selection algorithm will be very beneficial for very large data sets with multiple constraints and uncertainties. This algorithm will be utilized in a military unit selection tool.",,第3页.xls
411,Collaborative museum heist with reinforcement learning,2023,"Non-playable characters (NPCs) play a crucial role in enhancing immersion in video games. However, traditional NPC behaviors are often hard-coded using methods such as Finite State Machines, Decision and Behavior trees. This has a few limitations; namely, it is quite difficult to implement complex cooperative behaviors and secondly this makes it easy for human players to identify and exploit patterns in behavior. To overcome these challenges, Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to generate dynamic and real-time NPC responses to human player actions. In this paper, we report on first results of applying RL techniques to a Non-Zero Sum, adversarial asymmetric game, using a multi-agent team. The game environment simulates a museum heist, where the objective of the successfully trained team of robbers with different skills (Locksmith, Technician) is to steal valuable items from the museum without being detected by the scripted security guards and cameras. Both agents were trained concurrently with separate policies and received both individual and group reward signals. Through this training process, the agents learned to cooperate effectively and use their skills to maximize both individual and team benefits. These results demonstrate the feasibility of realizing the full game where both robbers and security guards are trained at the same time to achieve their adversarial goals.",,第3页.xls

413,Towards A Natural Language Interface for Flexible Multi-Agent Task Assignment [arXiv],2023,"Task assignment and scheduling algorithms are powerful tools for autonomously coordinating large teams of robotic or AI agents. However, the decisions these system make often rely on components designed by domain experts, which can be difficult for non-technical end-users to understand or modify to their own ends. In this paper we propose a preliminary design for a flexible natural language interface for a task assignment system. The goal of our approach is both to grant users more control over a task assignment system's decision process, as well as render these decisions more transparent. Users can direct the task assignment system via natural language commands, which are applied as constraints to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using a large language model (LLM). Additionally, our proposed system can alert users to potential issues with their commands, and engage them in a corrective dialogue in order to find a viable solution.

415,Free-form Conversation with Human and Symbolic Avatars in Mixed Reality,2023,"The integration of large language models and mixed reality technologies has enabled users to engage in free-form conversations with virtual agents across different realities. However, if and how the agent's visual representation, especially when combined with mixed reality environments, will affect the conversation content or user experience is not yet fully understood. In this work, we design and conduct a user study involving two types of visual representations (a human avatar and a symbolic avatar) and two mixed reality environments (virtual reality and augmented reality), facilitating a free-form conversation experience with GPT-3 powered agents. We found evidence that the use of virtual or augmented realities can influence conversation content. Users chatting with avatars in virtual reality made significantly more references to the location or the space, suggesting they tended to perceive conversations as occurring in the agent's space, whereas the physical AR environment was perhaps more perceived as the user's space. Conversations with the human avatar improve user recall of the conversation, even though there is no evidence of increased information extracted during the conversation. These observations and our analysis of post-study questionnaires suggest that human avatars can positively impact user memory and experience. We hope our findings and the open-source implementation will help facilitate future research on free-form conversational agents in mixed reality.",,第3页.xls
416,A multi-agent approach for logistic related to production and transportation,2005,"Most of problems related to production management and transportation are, on the one hand, NP-complete and on the other hand, frequently met in different industrial domains. Therefore, several communities, like those of management, automatic control and computer science, have been interested in such problems and several approaches have been proposed for their modeling and their solving: complete and incomplete methods. The approach adopted by the team logistic and transportation of the research unit SOIE is to use the multi-agent system and/or the constraint satisfaction problem formalism for modeling. Whereas, agent interaction and/or incomplete optimization methods have been applied for solving. The objective is, on the one hand, to represent faithfully the aspect often distributed of the considered problems and on the other hand, to accelerate the solving process.

418,Rapport Building with Social Robots as a Method for Improving Mission Debriefing in Human-Robot Teams,2020,"Conflicts may arise at any time during military debriefing meetings, especially in high intensity deployed settings. When such conflicts arise, it takes time to get everyone back into a receptive state of mind so that they engage in reflective discussion rather than unproductive arguing. It has been proposed by some that the use of social robots equipped with social abilities such as emotion regulation through rapport building may help to deescalate these situations to facilitate critical operational decisions. However, in military settings, the same AI agent used in the pre-brief of a mission may not be the same one used in the debrief. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a brief rapport-building session with a social robot could create a connection between a human and a robot agent, and whether consistency in the embodiment of the robot agent was necessary for maintaining this connection once formed. We report the results of a pilot study conducted at the United States Air Force Academy which simulated a military mission (i.e., Gravity and Strike). Participants connection with the agent, sense of trust, and overall likeability revealed that early rapport building can be beneficial for military missions.",,第3页.xls

420,Analysis of Complexity of Unsafe Behavior in Construction Teams and a Multiagent Simulation,2018,"The processes in construction are more likely than others to breed unsafe behaviors, and the consequences of these actions can be serious. This paper first reviews the research status on unsafe behavior in construction teams. It then analyzes the complex mechanisms that lead to unsafe behavior and constructs a three-layer structural model based on agent-based modeling (ABM) technology. This modeling deals with complexity and elaborates on key points and potential research ideas in the study of unsafe behavior in construction teams. Using the ABM method, the effects of different incentive strategies on the safe behavior of construction teams under different management scenarios were studied. The results showed that when members have a fair perception of the situation, the effect of the excess performance reward distribution, according to the member's safety awareness level, is better than the average distribution effect. This is the case whether the member's safety behavior level is positively or negatively related to the member's safety awareness level. This study proves the feasibility, validity, and universality of the three-layer structural model. It also reaches certain management conclusions and ideas for further development.

421,Flocking of a Team of Lagrangian Agents,2009,"Flocking of a team of Lagrangian agents is investigated in this paper. The motion equation of agents with Lagrangian dynamics and its properties are reviewed. The centrifugal and coriolis effects and gravitational terms in the dynamics of agents have been neglected in previous works on flocking problem. However the dynamics of many dynamical systems which would be the agents in practical applications can be assumed as Lagrangian with the above mentioned terms. The proposed flocking scheme is based on a gradient algorithm in which the collective potential is systematically constructed to cause the velocity of the agents to reach a consensus. It is explained that the suggested algorithm satisfies three rules of flocking demonstrated by Reynolds: cohesion, separation, and alignment. For this purpose the Hamiltonian of a team of agents with Lagrangian dynamics is considered and is treated as the Lyapunov like for the Multi-Agent system. Then considering the properties of the Lagrangian systems and also using the algebraic graph theory, it is shown that the derivative of the Hamiltonian is in order that the Reynolds rules are satisfied and the conditions under which flocking is achieved are derived. The analytical tools provided here are relayed on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. In simulation results, a group of wheeled mobile robots are used to show the effectiveness of the suggested algorithm.",,第3页.xls
422,Severity-sensitive norm-governed multi-agent planning,2018,"In making practical decisions, agents are expected to comply with ideals of behaviour, or norms. In reality, it may not be possible for an individual, or a team of agents, to be fully compliant-actual behaviour often differs from the ideal. The question we address in this paper is how we can design agents that act in such a way that they select collective strategies to avoid more critical failures (norm violations), and mitigate the effects of violations that do occur. We model the normative requirements of a system through contrary-to-duty obligations and violation severity levels, and propose a novel multi-agent planning mechanism based on Decentralised POMDPs that uses a qualitative reward function to capture levels of compliance: N-Dec-POMDPs. We develop mechanisms for solving this type of multi-agent planning problem and show, through empirical analysis, that joint policies generated are equally as good as those produced through existing methods but with significant reductions in execution time.",,第3页.xls
423,Obesity and endocrine therapy: Host factors and breast cancer outcome,2013,"Obesity is becoming increasingly prevalent and it has been linked to poor breast cancer outcomes. Because obesity is associated with increased adipose tissue mass and aromatase activity [the target of aromatase inhibitors (AIs)1, there is concern that these agents may be less effective in women who are overweight or obese. Four of the randomized trials of AIs vs. tamoxifen conducted in the adjuvant breast cancer setting (ATAC, BIG 1-98 and TEAM in the postmenopausal setting and ABCSG-12 in the premenopausal setting) have reported effects of body mass index (BMI) on the relative effectiveness of an AI vs. tamoxifen. Obesity was confirmed as an adverse prognostic factor in ATAC and BIG 1-98 but not the TEAM study; in ABSCG-12, obesity was associated with poor outcomes in the anastrozole arm only. In the three postmenopausal trials, the use of an AI vs. tamoxifen was associated with better outcomes at all levels of BMI [all hazard ratios for recurrence <1, although 95% confidence intervals often included 1 due to lower power and smaller reductions in risk]. Of note, there was no significant interaction of BMI with letrozole (vs. tamoxifen) in the BIG 1-98 trial; while ATAC investigators concluded that the relative benefit of anastrozole (vs. tamoxifen) might be better in thinner (vs. heavier) women. In ABCSG-12, the use of anastrozole (vs. tamoxifen) was associated with significantly worse outcomes in women with BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) (similar to the detrimental effect of anastrozole on overall survival seen in the parent trial). These findings do not support the use of BMI as a predictor of Al (vs. tamoxifen) benefit in the adjuvant setting in postmenopausal breast cancer. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

424,Supporting knowledge-based processes using flexible intelligent agents,2000,"We are concerned to develop knowledge-based approaches to facilitating teams of people who must cooperate in the operation of business processes. We are particularly interested in processes characterised by high degrees of situation specificity (e.g, project-based processes such as product design) and by contexts in which the individual team members have comparable levels of authority/power and autonomy in respect of their roles in a business process. To the extent that we are interested in process design, we attempt to identify key information that needs to be made available at early stages of a project to avoid revision costs at later stages. The successful deployment of knowledge-based systems in such circumstances is relatively limited. The significance of the problem is reflected in the Cognitive Engineering Research Programme and the People at the Centre of Communication and Information Technologies (PACCIT) Programme launched jointly by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council and Engineering and Physical Sciences Council (ESRC 1999). Research within these programmes seeks to develop a better understanding of how we should design interactive, knowledge-based systems through studying people, organisations and processes. This paper describes work which attempts to address some of the issues.",,第3页.xls
425,Game-theoretic agent programming in Golog under partial observability,2006,"We present the agent programming language POGTGolog, which integrates explicit agent programming in Golog with game-theoretic multi-agent planning in partially observable stochastic games. It deals with the case of one team of cooperative agents under partial observability, where the agents may have different initial belief states and not necessarily the same rewards. POGTGolog allows for specifying a partial control program in a high-level logical language, which is then completed by an interpreter in an optimal way. To this end, we define a formal semantics of POGTGolog programs in terms of Nash equilibria, and we specify a POGTGolog interpreter that computes one of these Nash equilibria. We illustrate the usefulness of POGTGolog along a rugby scenario.",,第3页.xls
426,A Trust-Based Team Formation Framework for Mobile Intelligence in Smart Factories,2020,"In Smart Factories, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) accomplish heterogeneous tasks as moving objects, restoring connectivity, or performing different manufacturing activities into production lines. These kinds of devices combine several capabilities, as artificial intelligence (visual and speech recognition, automatic fault detecting, proactive behavior) and mobility, into the so-called mobile intelligence. A typical scenario is represented by a workshop with a large number of mobile intelligent devices with associated agents, mutually interacting on their behalf. Here, to reach a given target by contemporary satisfying some basic requirements like effectiveness and efficiency, it is often necessary to organize ad hoc teams of free-moving vehicles, sensors, and smart devices. Therefore, a specific issue is the adequate representation of the reciprocal agent/device trustworthiness for advantaging such team formation processes within a smart factory environment. To this end, in this article, first, we define a trust measure based on reliability and reputation of AGVs, which are computed based on the feedbacks released for the AGVs activities in the factory; second, we design a trust framework exploiting the defined measures to support the formation of virtual, temporary, and trust-based teams of mobile intelligent devices; and third, we present a set of experimental results highlighting that the proposed trust framework can improve the workshop performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",,第3页.xls
427,Utterance Behavior of Users While Playing Basketball with a Virtual Teammate,2017,"Research on human-agent interaction has focused mainly on domains which are conversational in nature, but little work has been done on examining the behavior of interactive agents in domains such as team sports. This paper analyzes utterance behavior in this domain, specifically a virtual basketball game with an agent teammate. The main motivation is to assess the nature of utterances during the course of a game. We use a Wizard-of-Oz system which allows a hidden operator to appropriately respond to user utterances. Utterances are analyzed by annotating and categorizing according to Searle's illocutionary speech acts. We find that there is evidence to support the process of the user beginning with basic utterances needed to play the game, confirming that the agent can understand them, and then moving to more complex utterances. We also find that non-task utterances are used and their proportion increases as the game progresses.",,第3页.xls
428,Byzantine Gathering in Polynomial Time [arXiv],2018,"Gathering a group of mobile agents is a fundamental task in the field of distributed and mobile systems. This can be made drastically more difficult to achieve when some agents are subject to faults, especially the Byzantine ones that are known as being the worst faults to handle. In this paper we study, from a deterministic point of view, the task of Byzantine gathering in a network modeled as a graph. In other words, despite the presence of Byzantine agents, all the other (good) agents, starting from possibly different nodes and applying the same deterministic algorithm, have to meet at the same node in finite time and stop moving. An adversary chooses the initial nodes of the agents (the number of agents may be larger than the number of nodes) and assigns a different positive integer (called label) to each of them. Initially, each agent knows its label. The agents move in synchronous rounds and can communicate with each other only when located at the same node. Within the team, f of the agents are Byzantine. A Byzantine agent acts in an unpredictable and arbitrary way. For example, it can choose an arbitrary port when it moves, can convey arbitrary information to other agents and can change its label in every round, in particular by forging the label of another agent or by creating a completely new one. Besides its label, which corresponds to a local knowledge, an agent is assigned some global knowledge denoted by K that is common to all agents. In literature, the Byzantine gathering problem has been analyzed in arbitrary n-node graphs by considering the scenario when K = (n, f) and the scenario when K = f. In the first (resp. second) scenario, it has been shown that the minimum number of good agents guaranteeing deterministic gathering of all of them is f + 1 (resp. f + 2). However, for both these scenarios, all the existing deterministic algorithms, whether or not they are optimal in terms of required number of good agents, have the major disadvantage of having a time complexity that is exponential in n and L, where L is the value of the largest label belonging to a good agent. In this paper, we seek to design a deterministic solution for Byzantine gathering that makes a concession on the proportion of Byzantine agents within the team, but that offers a significantly lower complexity. We also seek to use a global knowledge whose the length of the binary representation (that we also call size) is small. In this respect, assuming that the agents are in a strong team i.e., a team in which the number of good agents is at least some prescribed value that is quadratic in f, we give positive and negative results. On the positive side, we show an algorithm that solves Byzantine gathering with strong teams in all graphs of size at most n, for any integers n and f, in a time polynomial in n and the length |lmin| of the binary representation of the smallest label of a good agent. The algorithm works using a global knowledge of size O(log log log n), which is of optimal order of magnitude in our context to reach a time complexity that is polynomial in n and |lmin|. Indeed, on the negative side, we show that there is no deterministic algorithm solving Byzantine gathering with strong teams, in all graphs of size at most n, in a time polynomial in n and |lmin| and using a global knowledge of size o(log log log n).",,第3页.xls
429,Multi-agent coalition formation for distributed area coverage: analysis and evaluation,2010,"In the multi-robot area coverage problem, a group of mobile robots have to cover an initially unknown environment using a sensor or coverage tool attached to each robot. Multi-robot area coverage is encountered in many applications of multi-robot systems including unmanned search and rescue, aerial reconnaissance, robotic demining, automatic lawn mowing, and inspection of engineering structures. We envisage that multi-robot coverage can be performed efficiently if robots are coordinated to form small teams while covering the environment. In this paper, we use a technique from coalitional game theory called a weighted voting game that allows each robot to dynamically identify other team members and form teams so that the efficiency of the area coverage operation is improved. We propose and evaluate a novel technique of computing the weights of a weighted voting game based on each robot's coverage capability and finding the best minimal winning coalition(BMWC). Also we designed a greedy method and a heuristic method to find BMWC in O(n log n) time and O(n2) time respectively. There is a trade-off between computational time and the optimal solution.",,第3页.xls
430,An agent-based model for improved system of systems decision making in air transportation,2019,"Team collaboration and decision making have a significant role in the overall performance of complex system of systems (SoS). Improved systems engineering (SE) processes and tools are needed during the systems development lifecycle to make decisions and rapidly evaluate and assess multiple design alternatives to effectively select architectural design strategies that result in the highest mission performance. Therefore, the early and consistent evaluation of these strategies and collaborative team decisions are essential. The degree of utility of alternative decision strategy designs may vary given the condition, but conditions are not always considered when these decisions are being made. This article applies the SE principles of design for change and flexibility in an agent-based model for simulation of design alternatives for systems analysis and decision making in evaluating and selecting the decision(s) for SoS comprised of collaborative teams that result in higher mission performance. The authors apply the proposed agent-based model to test the flight delay within the SoS structure of the air transportation domain. The flight delays are due to the management strategies initiated by the air traffic facilities to balance the air demand and capacity when conditions are not normal (such as severe weather). The experimental results suggest that: (1) the current strategies may result in unnecessary delays and underdelivery of flights to the airport during the hours where demand is well below capacity; (2) aggressive strategies may have the reverse effect; and (3) longer-duration strategies have a more significant impact on delays during severe weather conditions.",,第3页.xls

These framework and software tool are based on agent-oriented approach and packet-level network simulation. They are intended to evaluate and compare different cooperative distributed attacks and defence mechanisms. Botnet and defence components are represented in the paper as a set of collaborating and counteracting agent teams. Agents are supposed to collect information from various network sources, operate different situational knowledge, and react to actions of other agents.

432,Multi-agent Coordination for On-Demand Data Gathering with Periodic Information Upload,2019,"In this paper we develop a method for planning and coordinating a multi-agent team deployment to periodically gather information on demand. A static operation center (OC) periodically requests information from changing goal locations. The objective is to gather data in the goals and to deliver it to the OC, balancing the refreshing time and the total number of information packages. The system automatically splits the team in two roles: workers to gather data, or collectors to retransmit the data to the OC. The proposed three step method: (1) finds out the best area partition for the workers; (2) obtains the best balance between workers and collectors, and with whom the workers must to communicate, a collector or the OC; (3) computes the best tour for the workers to visit the goals and deliver them to the OC or to a collector in movement. The method is tested in simulations in different scenarios, providing the best area partition algorithm and the best balance between collectors and workers.",,第3页.xls
433,A cognitive agent that delivers human-centric advice about system design,2000,"The design of new Navy ships that can be effectively manned with dramatically fewer sailors raises can be supported by a digital design environment. In this paper we will describe an effort currently underway to develop a software agent, the Executive Advisor, that can reason about human factors information accessible within the design environment. It will be able to alert and advise the engineering design team regarding human factors issues and analyses appropriate to the current stage of the system design process. The agent is being built with a cognitive modeling tool called iGEN(TM), in order to (a) give advice about human factors issues and analyses appropriate to the current stage of design and design team activity, (b) reason about when to deliver and how to filter advice, (c) explain its advice, and (d) monitor changes in the design environment and reason about their impact.

This solution is derived based on the assumed existing algorithms for basic member graphs of a graph product. In this problem, a team of cleaner agents are responsible for capturing a hostile intruder in the network. While the agents can move in the network one hop at a time, the intruder is assumed to be arbitrarily fast in a way that it can traverse any number of nodes contiguously as far as no agents reside in those nodes. Here, we consider a version of the problem where each agent can replicate new agents. Hence, the algorithm start with a single agent and new agents are created on demand.",,第3页.xls
435,Utility of Doctrine with Multi-agent RL for Military Engagements,2022,"Artificial intelligence (AI), or more specifically deep learning approaches to AI, have led to astonishing results in recent times, which makes them a prime candidate for guiding agent actions in military domains. However, it is often difficult to train multiple agents with deep learning approaches when a task is sufficiently complex, or the state space is huge, as is often the case in military domains. One possible way to alleviate the difficulties associated with military tasks is to leverage military doctrine to assist in the guidance of multi-agent systems. Military doctrine is a guide to action rather than hard rules for the execution of military campaigns, operations, exercises, and engagements. Doctrine, written by experts in their respective domains, is used to make sure that each task associated with an engagement, for example, is executed according to military standards. Such standards ensure coordination between different tasks, resulting in a greater likelihood of Mission success. In addition, the efficacy of combining doctrine with deep learning must be tested to determine any realized benefit for AI driven military engagements under adversarial conditions. Further, the inherent complexities associated with military engagements demand coordination between heterogeneous resources and teams of Soldiers which are often geospatially separated. In this work, we establish a baseline of doctrine-based maneuvers for a military engagement scenario with a multi-agent system (MAS) embedded in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) simulation environment, now a standard test environment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We introduce a hybrid training approach that combines MARL with doctrine (MARDOC) to test whether doctrine-informed MARL policies produce more realistic behaviors and/or improved performance in a simple military engagement task. We compare this hybrid approach to both doctrine-only (i.e., supervised learning to mimic doctrine) and MARL-only approaches to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed MARDOC approach. Our experiments show that MARDOC approaches produce desired behavior and improved performance over supervised approaches or MARL alone. In summary, the experimental results suggest that MARDOC approaches provide a sufficient advantage over MARL alone due to agent doctrinal guidance of MARL exploration to overcome the complexities in military domains.",,第3页.xls
436,Distributed Data Reduction through Agent Collaboration,2009,"Distributed data mining (DDM) is an important research area. One of the approaches suitable for the DDM is to select relevant local patterns from the distributed databases. Such patterns, often called prototypes, are subsequently merged to create a compact representation of the distributed data repositories. In the paper the local prototype selection is carried out independently at each site where instances and features are selected simultaneously by teams of agents. To assure obtaining homogenous prototypes the feature selection requires collaboration of agents. In the paper two agent collaboration strategies producing a common set of features are proposed and experimentally validated. The paper includes a detailed description of the proposed approach and a discussion of the computational experiment results.",,第3页.xls
437,Innovations in multi-agent systems,2007,"This paper outlines an abridged history of agents as a guide for the reader to understand the trends and directions of future agent design. This description includes how agent technologies have developed using increasingly sophisticated techniques. It also indicates the transition of formal programming languages into object-oriented programming and how this transition facilitated a corresponding shift from scripted agents (bots) to agent-oriented designs. The trend shows that applications with agents are increasingly being used to assist humans, either at work or play. Examples include the ubiquitous paper clip, through to wizards, entire applications and even games. The trend also demonstrates that agents vary in the complexity of the problem being solved and their environment. Following the discussion of trends, we briefly look at the origins of agent technology and its principles, which reflects heavily on 'Intelligence with Interaction'. We further pinpoint how the interaction with humans is one of the critical components of modern Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) and how current applications fail to address this fact. The next generation of agents should focus on liuman-centric interaction to achieve intelligence. Utilising these advancements, we introduce a new paradigm that uses Intelligent Agents based on a Belief, Desire, and Intention (BDI) architecture to achieve situation awareness in a hostile environment. BDI agents are implemented using the JACK framework, and spawn agents with individual reasoning processes specifically relating to the goals being instigated in its environment. They depend on the environment or superior agents to generate goals for them to act upon. I ii order to improve the performance of the agents we need to remove this dependency. To this end, it is suggested that JACK can be extended to realise the Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop using feedback from a learning component within a team environment.

The action of an agent in a subspace is specified by a set of action rules. The antecedent part of action rules includes the position of the agent and the distance to the nearest opponent. The consequent part indicates the action that the agent takes when the antecedent part of the action rule is satisfied. The action of each agent is encoded into an integer string that represents the action rules. A chromosome is the concatenated string of integer strings for all agents. We employ an ES-type generation update scheme after producing new integer strings by using crossover and mutation. Through computer simulations, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",,第3页.xls
439,Finding Friend and Foe in Multi-Agent Games,2019,"Recent breakthroughs in AI for multi-agent games like Go, Poker, and Dota, have seen great strides in recent years. Yet none of these games address the real-life challenge of cooperation in the presence of unknown and uncertain teammates. This challenge is a key game mechanism in hidden role games. Here we develop the DeepRole algorithm, a multi-agent reinforcement learning agent that we test on The Resistance: Avalon, the most popular hidden role game. DeepRole combines counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) with deep value networks trained through self-play. Our algorithm integrates deductive reasoning into vector-form CFR to reason about joint beliefs and deduce partially observable actions. We augment deep value networks with constraints that yield interpretable representations of win probabilities. These innovations enable DeepRole to scale to the full Avalon game. Empirical game-theoretic methods show that DeepRole outperforms other hand-crafted and learned agents in five-player Avalon. DeepRole played with and against human players on the web in hybrid human-agent teams. We find that DeepRole outperforms human players as both a cooperator and a competitor.",,第3页.xls

441,Reducing spatial interference in robot teams by local-investment aggression,2005,"This paper extends and improves upon our previous work on the use of stereotypical aggressive display behavior to reduce interference in robot teams, and thus improve their overall efficiency. We examine a team of robots with no centralized control performing a transportation task in which robots frequently interfere with each other. The robots must work in the same space, so territorial methods are not appropriate. In our method, when robots come into competition for floor space, each selects an aggression level and the competition is resolved in favor of the more aggressive robot. Our recent work showed that choosing aggression proportional to task investment can produce better overall system performance compared to aggression chosen at random. This paper describes a new technique, local investment, for computing an aggression level that performs better than any previous method and relies only on local sensor data. The method is evaluated in a simulation study, and is then shown to be effective in a real-world robot implementation.",,第3页.xls

In this paper we present the design of a multi-agent system with cognitive properties meant to find optimal solution according to the game theory. The multi-agent system consists of two subsystems that compete for maximum profit for their teams. Subsystems have no communication capabilities with each other. The status of an agent can only be identified based on its actions on the environment. In order to find an optimal solution we use a Nash Equilibrium concept of a non-cooperative game. The implementation of the system is done on a microcontroller. The evaluation of the Nash Equilibrium convergence rate was performed for 4 cases.

Transportation routes can suddenly become inaccessible due to poor weather or other unexpected occurrences. Factors such as airplane speed, carrying capacity, and airport maximum-on-ground must also be considered to ensure on-time and efficient delivery. Unforeseen cargo needs may require quick re-planning to meet tight deadlines.To address the problem, we held the Airlift Challenge, an online multi-agent planning competition which concluded in early 2023. Competitors in the Airlift Challenge created innovative algorithms to execute a simulated airlift operation.

445,Engineering Responsible And Explainable Models In Human-Agent Collectives,2024,"In human-agent collectives, humans and agents need to work collaboratively and agree on collective decisions. However, ensuring that agents responsibly make decisions is a complex task, especially when encountering dilemmas where the choices available to agents are not unambiguously preferred over another. Therefore, methodologies that allow the certification of such systems are urgently needed. In this paper, we propose a novel engineering methodology based on formal model checking as a step toward providing evidence for the certification of responsible and explainable decision making within human-agent collectives. Our approach, which is based on the MCMAS model checker, verifies the decision-making behavior against the logical formulae specified to guarantee safety and controllability, and address ethical concerns. We propose the use of counterexample traces and simulation results to provide a judgment and an explanation to the AI engineer as to the reasons actions may be refused or allowed. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, we evaluate it using the real-world problem of human-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) teaming in dynamic and uncertain environments.",,第3页.xls

452,Layered and resource-adapting agents in the RoboCup simulation,1999,"Layered agent architectures are particularly successful in implementing a broad spectrum of (sub-)cognitive abilities, such as reactive feedback, deliberative problem solving, and social coordination. They can be seen as special instances of boundedly rational systems, i.e., systems that trade off the quality of a decision versus the cost of invested resources. For sophisticated domains, such as the soccer simulation of RoboCup, we argue that a generalised framework that combines a layered design with explicit, resource-adapting mechanisms is reasonable. Based on the InteRRaP model, we describe a prototypical setting that is to guide and to evaluate the development of reasoning about abstract resources. These are representations of general interdependencies between computational processes. The realised soccer team, CosmOz Saarbrucken, participated successfully in the RoboCup-98 competition and confirmed that abstract resources are an appropriate modelling device in layered and resource-adapting agents.",,第3页.xls
453,Reinforcement learning rules in a repeated game,2001,"This paper examines the performance of simple reinforcement learning algorithms in a stationary environment and in a repeated game where the environment evolves endogenously based on the actions of other agents. Some types of reinforcement teaming rules can be extremely sensitive to small changes in the initial conditions, consequently, events early in a simulation can affect the performance of the rule over a relatively long time horizon. However, when multiple adaptive agents interact, algorithms that performed poorly in a stationary environment often converge rapidly to a stable aggregate behaviors despite the slow and erratic behavior of individual learners. Algorithms that are robust in stationary environments can exhibit slow convergence in an evolving environment.",,第3页.xls
454,Modeling and Simulation of Coalition Formation,2015,"One of the challenges of agent technologies is to provide models of team or group activities in which agents contact each other, negotiate and collaborate towards certain objectives. Such groups are related to multiagent systems. In context of multi-agent systems, separate agents can cooperate and join together in order to execute the faced tasks in a more efficient way or in order to gain benefits. The paper deals with unselfish agents which are concerned about the systems global outcome, without regards for personal payoff. Coalition formation is a very complex process which requires correct planning and preliminary modeling to be solved effectively. In the paper, we considered the problem of modeling the coalition formation from unselfish agents. There are several tools that allow providing and carrying out coalition formation modeling. In the paper, we showed how the Petri Nets can be used for such modeling. For the purpose of simulation of coalition formation the open access web application was developed.",,第3页.xls
455,An improved fuzzy mechanism for 3D Soccer simulation agent's shoot skill,2006,"RoboSoccer simulation is a complex multi-agent system in which agents play the role of soccer players and the main goal is to have a perfect domain for research and investigation on artificial intelligence. This paper intends to propose a new scoring module to select the best point on the goal line to shoot, considering player's position, catching and shooting time difference, and distance to target. Two different approaches have been implemented for this purpose. The first one is a simple decision making policy and the latter one takes advantage of statistical measurement and fuzzy decision making. Results show the superiority of the proposed method performance in over our previous work implemented on Nexus 3D RoboSuccer team of Ferdowsi University.",,第3页.xls
456,Quantization effects on synchronized motion of teams of mobile agents with second-order dynamics,2012,"For a team of mobile agents governed by second-order dynamics, this paper studies how different quantizers affect the performances of consensus-type schemes to achieve synchronized collective motion. It is shown that when different types of quantizers are used for the exchange of relative position and velocity information between neighboring agents, different collective behaviors appear. Under the chosen logarithmic quantizers and with symmetric neighbor relationships, we prove that the agents' velocities and positions get synchronized asymptotically. We show that under the chosen symmetric uniform quantizers and with symmetric neighbor relationships, the agents' velocities converge to the same value asymptotically while the differences of their positions converge to a bounded set. We also show that when the uniform quantizers are not symmetric, the agents' velocities may grow unboundedly. Through simulations we present richer undesirable system behaviors when different logarithmic and uniform quantizers are used. Such different quantization effects underscore the necessity for a careful selection of quantization strategies, especially for multi-agent systems with higher-order agent dynamics.

457,Risk assessment of capability requirements using WISDOM-II,2006,"The analysis of capability requirements is very important for military operational decision. It assists defence analysts to make decisions at all strategic, operational and tactical levels. However it tends to be extremely expensive and time-consuming because of the complexity under the military command, control and communication environment. Information technologies, such as red teaming, complex adaptive systems and agent based systems, can facilitate such analysis in a well-structured and systematic way through computer simulations. Based on these technologies, a promising agent-based combat simulation system - WISDOM-II is built. In this paper, we conduct a series of analysis to evaluate the effect of different capability configurations on the performance of different force compositions.",,第3页.xls
458,Collective activity and autonomous characters: decision-making engine based on trusted relationships,2017,"When working in teams, people make mistakes. To train someone in a collaborative virtual environment to adapt to teammates that bahave non optimally, we propose (1) an augmentation of the ACTIVITY-Description Language as well as mechanisms of propagation of constraints that will facilitate agents reasoning; and (2) an agent model in which each agent is described through three dimensions (integrity, benevolence, abilities) corresponding to the MDS trust model. Besides each agent has different personal and collective goals and has beliefs about others integrity, benevolence and abilities. This agent model is associated to a decision-making system that allows agents to adopt human-like behaviors. In particular, agents take others into account and are able to reason on their beliefs about others both when choosing which goal (collective or individual) to focus on and when selecting a task. We conducted a preliminary evaluation in which participants evaluated the behaviors produced with our system.",,第3页.xls
459,Composition through agent negotiation: A step towards fluid imterfaces,2000,"One of the next challenges in research on Human Computer Interfaces (HCI) is to give users the means to perceive and manipulate easily huge quantities of information in the minimum amount of time. Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) have been proposed as a means to solve this problem. The intelligence in the interface makes the system more flexible and more adaptable. One subset of IUI is adaptive interfaces. An adaptive interface modifies its behaviour according to some defined constraints (technical, psychosensory and user-defined ones) in order to best satisfy globally all of them. In this paper we introduce the concept of fluid interfaces, a particular kind of adaptive interface on which the flow of information composes itself smoothly without any predefined fixed pattern but according to several parameters. We introduce the problems raised by self-composition in user interface, then describe our proposition of an agent architecture to achieve fluidity. Information is modelled through agents that negotiate according to technical, psyche-sensory and user-defined constraints in order to compose a dynamic display. We detail a prototype that validates the model and introduce a European project which is derived from the model and tackles industrial applications.",,第3页.xls
460,AI For Global Climate Cooperation 2023 Competition Proceedings [arXiv],2023,"The international community must collaborate to mitigate climate change and sustain economic growth. However, collaboration is hard to achieve, partly because no global authority can ensure compliance with international climate agreements. Combining AI with climate-economic simulations offers a promising solution to design international frameworks, including negotiation protocols and climate agreements, that promote and incentivize collaboration. In addition, these frameworks should also have policy goals fulfillment, and sustained commitment, taking into account climate-economic dynamics and strategic behaviors. These challenges require an interdisciplinary approach across machine learning, economics, climate science, law, policy, ethics, and other fields. Towards this objective, we organized AI for Global Climate Cooperation, a Mila competition in which teams submitted proposals and analyses of international frameworks, based on (modifications of) RICE-N, an AI-driven integrated assessment model (IAM). In particular, RICE-N supports modeling regional decision-making using AI agents. Furthermore, the IAM then models the climate-economic impact of those decisions into the future. Whereas the first track focused only on performance metrics, the proposals submitted to the second track were evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative evaluation focused on a combination of (i) the degree of mitigation of global temperature rise and (ii) the increase in economic productivity. On the other hand, an interdisciplinary panel of human experts in law, policy, sociology, economics and environmental science, evaluated the solutions qualitatively. In particular, the panel considered the effectiveness, simplicity, feasibility, ethics, and notions of climate justice of the protocols. In the third track, the participants were asked to critique and improve RICE-N.",,第3页.xls
461,Diversity Voting and its Application in Real-time Strategy Games Multi-Objective Optimization Decision-Making Behavior Modeling,2016,"In this paper, we present a novel approach based on diversity and voting for studying the Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problems in Real-Time Strategy game (RTS). MOO is one of the most important research topics in Decision-Making Behavior Modeling (DMBM) of RTS. It includes but is not limited to Tactical Position Selection (TPS), Force and Fire Allocation, Targets Selection and Path Planing, etc. The computing efficiency of multi-objective optimization algorithms is of vital importance to the believable representation of RTS agents decision-making behaviors. Currently however, most MOO techniques used in Game AI decision-making behavior modeling cannot satisfy the great demand in future RTS game AI in aspect of time efficiency.According to above problems and taking the TPS decision-making behavior in RTS game AI as research background, the paper proposed a novel MOO-oriented Diversity Voting model based on Group Diversity and Social Choice theory. Through forming diverse problem solving team, agents compute and further propose individual solutions and using voting method for group opinion aggregation. Contrary to traditional Diversity Voting models, the paper fully considers the feature of multiple Pareto results in MOO problem solving and establishes our model based on Approval Voting. More importantly, we change the traditional parameter-based voting into solution-based method during opinion aggregation among problem solvers. We formalize the TPS problem in MOO manner, then carry out the problem solving tests based respectively on single MOO algorithm and on our Diversity Voting model. Further, we take advantages of little interactions among problem solvers and test the problem solving ability of model under parallelized conditions.",,第3页.xls

Traditionally, the recognition of formations is carried-out Without taking into account an expressive representation of relations between players. This kind of approaches are not able to manage the constant changes occurring in the soccor domain, which results in an inefficient way of recognizing formations immerse in dynamic environments. It, is presented in this work an efficient, model to recognize formations based on a representation that takes into account multiple relations among defender, midfielder and forward players.

463,Emotion-based control of cooperating heterogeneous mobile robots,2002,"Previous experiences show that it is possible for agents such as robots cooperating asynchronously on a sequential task to enter deadlock, where one robot does not fulfill its obligations in a timely manner due to hardware or planning failure, unanticipated delays, etc. Our approach uses a formal multilevel hierarchy of emotions where emotions both modify active behaviors at the sensory-motor level and change the set of active behaviors at the schematic level. The resulting implementation of a team of heterogeneous robots using a hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture produced the desired emergent societal behavior. Data collected at two different public venues illustrate how a dependent agent selects new behaviors (e.g., stop serving, move to intercept the refiller) to compensate for delays from a subordinate agent (e.g., blocked by the audience). The subordinate also modifies the intensity of its active behaviors in response to feedback from the dependent agent. The agents communicate asynchronously through Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language via wireless Ethernet.",,第3页.xls

467,A layered modeling and simulation architecture for agent-based system development,2001,"This paper proposes a layered architectural framework to support agent-based system development in a collaborative, multidisciplinary engineering setting. This architecture is viewed from two distinct perspectives. First, the environment must enable agent-based modeling and simulation. Second, it should support concurrent (team-oriented) engineering. The main focus is on the proposed layered architecture delineating various needs of an agent-based system, thus supporting incremental specification, design, implementation, and testing. In our discussions, we distinguish between performing agents and simulated agents. The former refers to agents as they are performing their tasks in real-world settings. The latter refers to agents that have their behavior simulated in a virtual environment. In these terms, the proposed framework is intended to form the basis for environments that support development of agents, in both performance and simulation modes, as well as in hybrid combination (both performing and simulated agents interacting at the same time). The proposed framework is a step toward realization of agent-based systems under the umbrella of the simulation-based acquisition (SBA) initiative of the U.S. Department of Defense.",,第3页.xls

469,Integrating social skills in task-oriented 3D IVA,2005,"This paper presents a set of mechanisms oriented to incorporate social information into the decision taking of task-oriented 3DIVA. The aim of this approach is to integrate collaborative skills in different character's roles (seller/buyer, worker, pedestrian, etc.) in order to enhance its behavioral animation. The collective intelligence expected in this kind of multi-character domains (e.g. storytelling, urban simulation, interactive games, etc.) requires agents able to dialogue/interact with other characters, to autonomously group/ungroup (according to their goals), or to distribute tasks and coordinate their execution for solving possible conflicts. The social model implemented follows the definitions for collaborative agents, since agents use communicative acts to cooperate. In this context, collaboration derives mainly from two points: team formation (grouping for 3DIVA) and task coordination (reducing dependences between agent activities). Finally, we show the results obtained in 3D multi-character simulations (resource competition), created to verify the social behavior introduced.",,第3页.xls
470,Policy Distillation and Value Matching in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning [arXiv],2019,"Multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARL) have been demonstrated on complex tasks that require the coordination of a team of multiple agents to complete. Existing works have focused on sharing information between agents via centralized critics to stabilize learning or through communication to increase performance, but do not generally look at how information can be shared between agents to address the curse of dimensionality in MARL. We posit that a multiagent problem can be decomposed into a multi-task problem where each agent explores a subset of the state space instead of exploring the entire state space. This paper introduces a multiagent actor-critic algorithm and method for combining knowledge from homogeneous agents through distillation and value-matching that outperforms policy distillation alone and allows further learning in both discrete and continuous action spaces.",,第3页.xls
471,Lightning Talk - Ruuh: A Conversational Social Agent,2019,"Dialogue systems and conversational agents are becoming increasingly popular in the modern society but building an agent capable of holding intelligent conversation with its users is a challenging problem for artificial intelligence. In this talk, we share challenges and learnings from our journey of building a deep learning based conversational social agent called Ruuh (m.me/Ruuh) developed by a team at Microsoft India to converse on a wide range of topics. The authors are co-creators of Ruuh and the original paper was presented in NeurIPS 2018 Demonstration Track by two of the authors. As a social agent, Ruuh needs to think beyond the utilitarian notion of merely generating relevant responses and meet a wider range of user social needs. The agent also needs to detect and respond to abusive language, sensitive topics and trolling behavior of users. Some of the above objectives pose significant research challenges in the areas of NLP, IR and AI. Our agent has interacted with over 2 million real world users till date which has generated over 150 million user conversations. We intend to walk the audience through our journey of overcoming several research challenges to become the most popular social agent in India.",,第3页.xls
472,Amulti-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on improvedDDPG in Actor-Critic framework,2021,"Real-world artificial intelligence (AI) applications often require multiple agents to work together, and effective communication and coordination between artificial agents is an indispensable step toward universal artificial intelligence. This paper takes the self-developed virtual environment for police training as a test scenario. Setting tasks requires multiple different service agent teams to cooperate or fight against each other. In order to ensure that the communication method is effective and scalable, this paper proposes the mixed deep deterministic policy gradient (Mi-DDPG) algorithm. Firstly, the bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN) is added to the Actor network as the information exchange layer of the same type of agent, and then the other agent information is added to the Critic network to learn the multi-agent cooperation strategy. In addition, in order to alleviate the training pressure, the centralized training and distributed execution framework are adopted, and the $Q$ function in the Critic network is modularized. In the experiment, the Mi- DDPG algorithm is compared with other algorithms in different scenarios, which shows its most advanced performance and potential value in real-world.",,第3页.xls
473,E-leadership effectiveness in virtual teams: motivating language perspective,2014,"Purpose - Virtual teams are becoming a norm in current knowledge-based society and offer a wide range of organizational benefits. This paper aims to investigate the effects of leaders' motivating language (ML) and feedback approach on virtual team members' creativity performance.Design/methodology/approach - A 2 x 2 with pre-test and post-test experimental design was employed to explore how to stimulate virtual team members' creativity performance using a group decision support system.Findings The results show that leaders' ML and feedback approach via e-mail instructions have different interaction effects on members' creativity and idea generation performance. Team members receiving direction-giving instructions generate more ideas under the demanding feedback approach and team member receiving instructions with more empathetic language exhibit higher creativity performance under the encouraging feedback approach.Research limitations/implications - Shortcomings of virtual environment and leadership remain the major factors influencing such findings. Since the results are also restrained by the functionality of the utilized software tool, tools for virtual teams are recommended to include features that can support the effective use of team leaders' motivational language.Social implications - Virtual team leaders should provide proper guidance to members using understanding and empathetic wording approach. For task-oriented work, leaders should consider giving more specific instructions and provide constant feedback for completed work. For creative work, leaders should give positive encouragement as feedback or even challenge team members to stimulate their creativity. Additionally, facilitation rules can be set up in advance so that the intelligent agent can timely send out follow-up instructions/feedback.Originality/value - The gained insights beneficially help tool developers for virtual teams build/ enhance their tools based on the need of team leaders. This paper also usefully offers important implications regarding how to motivate virtual team members' creative thinking.",,第3页.xls

476,Training social skills in virtual reality machine learning as a process of co-creation,2022,"The training of social skills in interactive Virtual Reality scenes has become an issue of rising interest in research and development. This is also the case of the project Virtual Skills Lab that deals with the question how the potential of such a training can be applied to the context of organizations. In a virtual office scene, the interaction between the player and the computer-generated agent is based on speech recognition and conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI). While studies and experiments have shown that humans are able to treat agents in Virtual Reality as if they were real persons, it is still impossible to establish truly spontaneous forms of interaction by combining speech recognition, conversational AI and Virtual Reality. Hence, existing applications for social skills training in Virtual Reality focus on the possibility to literally take over the other's perspective or the ability to overcome social anxieties. Yet, social interaction in the workplace is always embedded in a given organizational culture and therefore characterized by behavioral patterns. In this sense, a Virtual Reality training tool for social interaction in the workplace can be enriched by design elements that enable machine learning in terms of pattern recognition. The paper outlines how the project team has dealt with the existing limitations of conversational AI in the process of working out the storyline and what design elements can be introduced in the Virtual Reality interaction in order to enable the machinic recognition of patterns of organizational culture.",,第3页.xls

The goal of the robotic soccer competition is to develop completely autonomous robotic agents that can cooperate to perform the desired tasks in an extremely dynamic environment. The approach is to train the robots, using various combinations of learning algorithms, i.e, the robots are to initially have no understanding of their environment. The robots are rewarded for positive contributions to the team, and in turn learn better performance through multiple sessions. The majority of learning will take place in simulation and then transferred to real physical mobile robots. The simulation worlds will be modeled after the physical world. No hard coded training or environmental information will be provided by the programmers. Any information stored in the internal of an agent will be strictly learned.The concept of Tropism-based Control Architecture is introduced that not only allows for the evolution of cooperative strategies, but also obtains the acquired knowledge in a format that is easily comprehensible by humans. The proposed cognitive architecture has been inspired by biological system. The results of many generations of simulated evolution are presented, accompanied by the game results and fitness characteristics.

478,Agent-based workflow management in collaborative product development on the Internet,2000,"Product development is collaborative, involving multi-disciplinary functions and heterogeneous tools. Teamwork is essential through seamless tool integration and better co-ordination of human activities. This paper proposes to use workflow management as a mechanism to facilitate the teamwork in a collaborative product development environment where remote Web-based Decision Support Systems (TeleDSS) are extensively used by team members who are geographically distributed. The workflow of a project is modelled as a network. Its nodes correspond to the work (packages), and its edges to flows of control and data. The concept of agents is introduced to define nodes and the concept of messages to define edges. As a sandwich layer, agents act as special-purpose application clients for the remote TeleDSS application servers. Agents are delegated to manipulate the corresponding TeleDSS on behalf of their human users. Details of the proceedings are recorded by agents as their properties for future references or shared uses by other team members. Through flow messages, agents are able to share input and output data and request for remote services. One of the major contributions is that agents, once defined, can be reused for different projects without any changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls
479,Enabling intra-robotic capabilities adaptation using an organization-based multiagent system,2004,"In harsh or dangerous environments, robots can lose function in multiple sensors and effectors over the mission, thus reducing their overall capability. If the capabilities provided by these sensors/effectors are necessary for mission completion, having an adaptive system that can overcome these losses is critical to mission accomplishment. In this paper, we propose a solution using multiple agents, organized as a team, to give robots the ability to adapt and overcome sensor/effector loss. When a sensor/effector is lost, the team can reorganize to provide the robot highest operational utility, given its current capabilities. The robot can adapt to such losses by substituting other sets of sensors/effectors to provide the best overall capability. While the robot may operate at a lower level of effectiveness, it will be able continue its mission, if possible.",,第3页.xls
480,Agent-based modeling of collaborative interaction in ubiquitous learning environment using local dynamic behavior,2016,"This paper focuses on modeling collaborative interaction in Ubiquitous Learning Environment (ULE) based on the assumption that the collaborative interaction can be perceived through interpersonal interactions, which can be described as local dynamic behaviors of the team. In this paper, the collaborative interaction is collected from the experiment with 50 students having 5 members per team. Then the collaborative interaction is coded with 16 participation shift (P-shifts) from 5 different types of turns including turn receiving, turn claiming, turn usurping, turn continuing, and turn noreturning to represent the participation status of each member. Three types of participation statuses used in this paper are the contributor, the target and the unaddressed recipient. Then the discovered local dynamic behavior is used for constructing the model by using agent-based modeling. The model consists of student agents working together according to the discovered behavior. Then, the constructed model is verified by comparing the actual behavior with the simulated behavior. Finally, the comparison result shows that the constructed model can reasonably be the model for modeling collaborative interaction in ULE.",,第3页.xls

488,Hierarchical Reactive Control for a Team of Humanoid Soccer Robots,2007,"Humanoid soccer serves as benchmark problem for artificial intelligence research and robotics. Every year, more teams are competing, e.g., in the RoboCup Humanoid league. As the robots manage the basic skills of walking, kicking, and getting up better, teams can focus on soccer skills and team coordination. The complexity of soccer behaviors and team play calls for structured behavior engineering.In this paper, we describe the design of the behavior control software for the Humanoid League team NimbRo. The control software is based on a framework that supports a hierarchy of reactive behaviors. It is structured both as an agent hierarchy (joint - body part - player - team) and as a time hierarchy. The speed of sensors, behaviors, and actuators decreases when moving up in the hierarchy. The lowest levels of this framework contain position control of individual joints and kinematic interfaces; for body parts. At the next level, basic skills are implemented. These are used by soccer behaviors like searching for the ball, approaching the ball, avoiding obstacles, and defending the goal. Finally, on the tactical level, the robots communicate via a wireless network to negotiate roles and use allocentric information to configure the soccer behaviors.Our robots won all humanoid soccer competitions of RoboCup 2007, which took place in Atlanta, GA.",,第3页.xls

The proposed framework is a modular and cost-effective open-source hardware and software platform that is intended to help develop multiagent systems for research and education. Numerous multi-agent platforms have been developed in the literature to date that are used in various robotic applications, such as surveillance, target localization, cooperative estimation, among others. However, most of them are either tailored towards particular applications or driven by expensive software and hardware. The proposed MAFOSS system is developed for robotic applications, where a team of mobile agents (robots) is deployed to achieve a common goal. A major contribution of the MAFOSS system is the development of an open-hardware platform for differential-drive mobile robots (herein called eduMOD mobile robots). The software architecture of the current framework mostly relies on the robot operating system (ROS).

Agents must detect targets with limited-range onboard sensors. It is desired to minimize the expected waiting time between the appearance of a target point, and the instant it is visited. When the sensing radius is small, the system time is dominated by time spent searching, and it is shown that the optimal policy requires the agents to search a region at a relative frequency proportional to the square root of its renewal rate. On the other hand, when targets appear frequently, the system time is dominated by time spent servicing known targets, and it is shown that the optimal policy requires the agents to service a region at a relative frequency proportional to the cube root of its renewal rate. Furthermore, the presented algorithms in this case recover the optimal performance achieved by agents with full information of the environment. Simulation results verify the theoretical performance of the algorithms.",,第3页.xls
492,Artificial Swarming Shown to Amplify Accuracy of Group Decisions in Subjective Judgment Tasks,2020,"New technologies enable distributed human teams to form real-time systems modeled after natural swarms. Often referred to as Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) or simply human swarming, these real-time systems have been shown to amplify group intelligence across a wide range of tasks, from handicapping sports to forecasting financial markets. While most prior research has studied human swarms with 20-100 members, the present study explores the ability of ASI to amplify accuracy in small teams of 3-6 members. The present study also explores if conducting multiple swarms and aggregating by taking a vote of swarms can further amplify the accuracy. A large set of 66 small teams were engaged in this study. Each team was given a standard subjective judgement test. Participants took the test both as individuals and real-time swarms. The average individual scored 69% correct, while the average swarm scored 84% correct (p< 0.001). In addition, aggregation of multiple swarms revealed additional amplifications of accuracy. For example, by randomly selecting sets of 3 swarms and aggregating by plurality vote, average accuracy increased to 91% (p< 0.001). These results suggest that when small teams make subjective judgements as real-time swarms, they can be significantly more accurate than individual members, and that their accuracy can be further amplified by aggregating the output across small sets of swarms.",,第3页.xls
493,A Zero-Day Cloud Timing Channel Attack,2022,"The Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) services of a North American cloud service provider were ineffective against a simulated network timing channel attack. During the tests, three conspiring white hat agents exchanged a total of 33,024 network packets. As the proxy based attack executed, the vendor's intrusion detection service did not generate a warning, nor did its intrusion prevention service drop packets. Throughout the experiment, 4,096 bytes of randomized data (simulating covert traffic) were exchanged over a 2.06 hour period (4.4 bits-per-second); however, the vendor's Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled threat detection service did not issue an alert. A Wilcoxon Ranked Sum test on the before-and after throughput confirmed none of the vendor's countermeasures triggered/intervened to a statistically significant degree (threat intel: p = 0.703, IDPS: p = 0.998, threat intel + IDPS: p = 0.118). These results indicate those accountable for data-oriented Service Organization Control (SOC) 2/3 reports (e.g., auditors, cybersecurity executives, etc.) should carefully examine the assurances offered by cloud service providers with regard to their network steganography defenses.",,第3页.xls
494,Enabling Intuitive Human-Robot Teaming Using Augmented Reality and Gesture Control [arXiv],2019,"Human-robot teaming offers great potential because of the opportunities to combine strengths of heterogeneous agents. However, one of the critical challenges in realizing an effective human-robot team is efficient information exchange - both from the human to the robot as well as from the robot to the human. In this work, we present and analyze an augmented reality-enabled, gesture-based system that supports intuitive human-robot teaming through improved information exchange. Our proposed system requires no external instrumentation aside from human-wearable devices and shows promise of real-world applicability for service-oriented missions.

While global cooperation and guidance are important, there is also an essential role and benefit from national policies that respect local circumstances and cultural differences. Hospitals will have a new role and data sharing and cooperation between areas such as acute and long-term care will be even more important. Further integration of infection control, microbiology and infectious diseases staff in IPC teams is needed. The digital and AI revolutions have roles to play in how and where patients are seen and diagnosed. The built environment may have longer-term influence on changing the behaviour of health professionals than education and training. One constant is the need for highly trained, flexible and motivated staff in these IPC teams.",,第3页.xls

A developed test model for a system of automatic mine clearance combines neural network control and a multiagent approach, which represents today's paradigm of designing very complex distributed systems. The key point of the model developed is the use of a neural network for providing self-organizing communication among cooperative robots.

499,Multi-Agent Systems for the Real World,2010,"Our work addresses the effectiveness of collaborative divisions of labor between agents and humans in real-time dynamic and uncertain domains such as disaster rescue, hospital triage, and military operations. Our particular focus is systems where each person is assisted by an agent running on a device that they carry in the field. Such combinations make it possible to explore synergies between the unique strengths of both humans and machines, rather than struggling to build systems focused on ameliorating the weaknesses of one or the other. Specifically, we rely upon people for a sense of critical factors that constrain likely solutions, and for systems to do efficient, comprehensive and accurate computations (once problem complexity has been contained). In that spirit, we introduce a new approach, STaC, based on the premise that people have good intuitions about how to solve problems in each domain. The idea is to enable users to encode their intuitions as guidance for a system of agents, and for the agents to use this guidance when assisting the users in addressing the problems. The key to STaC is using the human users' guidance to break complex activities into simpler task structures that can be turned over to a single agent to determine who does what, when and where with respect to these significantly simpler task structures. This mitigates the distributed reasoning challenge and enables using auxiliary solvers based on established AI techniques capable of producing good solutions when given problems at this smaller scale. These smaller task structures can be solved independently because the agent system can assume that the human guidance has addressed any significant dependencies. STaC addresses tracking the dynamism in these task structures, the transitioning of agent assignments between these smaller task structures and the invocation of auxiliary solvers. Given that the task structures are treated independently and sufficiently small to be centralized, we call them sandbox reasoners. The sandbox reasoners required in each domain are different, so custom code must be written for each domain. However, the benefit of the approach is that sandbox reasoners are significantly simpler than the custom solvers required to produce a custom solution for a domain. We worked for 18 months to build an agent system where a team of humans with radios and our coordinator agents competed against human teams collaborating only via radios in field exercises involving simulated disaster-rescue operations. The results provided significant evidence for the benefits of our approach. Our starting point was our generic CSC system developed during the previous two years to solve generic, synthetically generated problem instances. Even though the synthetically-generated problem instances were created from templates that combined typical coordination situations, the resulting problems and task structures were not understandable by humans. In contrast, the field exercise problems appeal to a lifetime of experience coordinating every day activities. Intuitions about space, distance, time, importance and risk, that are quite natural to humans, enabled the human teams to rapidly devise sophisticated strategies. It became rapidly obvious that the generic CSC system would not be able to produce solutions comparable to the desired sophisticated, coordinated behavior of human-produced strategies. To gain the best of both worlds, we extended our approach so that policies would be constrained by guidance provided by users. The first set of field exercises used a simple language for guidance that specified a sequence of sites to visit where all agents were a single coordinating group. The system made decisions that it could evaluate accurately (e.g., how to perform repairs or rescue injured at a single site). In the first set of exercises, we were competitive, but not markedly superior, losing in two out of three tested scenarios and winning in the third. The final language for guidance was inspired by observations of the radio-team strategies, extensive discussions with subject matter experts and extensive numbers of simulations. While the human team could not execute a strategy as well as we could, the space of strategies that they were able to engage were far more sophisticated than ours. Thus, we created a more sophisticated formalism for capturing human strategic guidance that resulted in STaC. We enabled the ability to create multiple independent coordination groups with overlapping membership. The system relied on metrics to determine how to move agents among groups. We also introduced the ability to constrain the activities of each coordinating group. With those changes, we outperformed the radio team in all second-round tests because they were able to communicate their strategy to their agents, and the system optimized the execution of the strategy, adapting it to the dynamics of the environment.",,第3页.xls

It is also self-evident that we live in a world of automation, artificial intelligence, and expert systems. Given these two assertions, we propose that some aspects of leadership are candidates for automation. This paper briefly reviews relevant leadership literature and describes three leadership behaviors that may be possibly automated: goal setting, performance monitoring, and performance consequences. The paper also explores the relationship of different embodiments of the artificial leaders and the impact of these embodiments as varying degrees of social presence and the effect of this presence on performance and satisfaction outcomes.",,第3页.xls

In the formulation, each vehicle is modelled as a HICA with its own embedded hybrid control primitives and planning/coordination logic. The scheme is demonstrated experimentally.",,第3页.xls
502,Optimizing the Integration of Agent-Based Cloud Orchestrators and Higher-Level Workloads,2017,"The flexibility of cloud computing has put significant strain on operations teams. Manually installing and configuring applications in the cloud simply isnt an option anymore.

However, the issue of automatic dependency management between multiple applications is still an open, hard problem according to researchers at Google. Agent-based modeling and orchestration tools like Juju solve the issue of getting from zero to a working set of correctly clustered and connected frameworks. The shortcomings of these state-of-the-art tools are that they dont provide efficient ways to model and orchestrate workloads running on top of these frameworks. This paper presents a number of ways to deploy and orchestrate workloads with Juju, compares their performance and overhead, and suggests how this overhead can be minimized.",,第3页.xls
503,Towards IMACA: Intelligent Multimodal Affective Conversational Agent,2012,"A key aspect when trying to achieve natural interaction in machines is multimodality. Besides verbal communication, in fact, humans interact also through many other channels, e. g., facial expressions, gestures, eye contact, posture, and voice tone. Such channels convey not only semantics, but also emotional cues that are essential for interpreting the message transmitted. The importance of the affective information and the capability of properly managing it, in fact, has been more and more understood as fundamental for the development of a new generation of emotion-aware applications for several scenarios like e-learning, e-health, and human-computer interaction. To this end, this work investigates the adoption of different paradigms in the fields of text, vocal, and video analysis, in order to lay the basis for the development of an intelligent multimodal affective conversational agent.",,第3页.xls

In fact, we simulate the city with multi agent systems using them to represent each part of the system(individuals, buildings, streets,). The MIRO team is composed by scientists of several domains (computer sciences, geography or economy), so we want to construct a model of the city to share knowledges of each domain. The next step, we will use verification approach in order to validate the model and then the simulator because we want to generate simulator from model. Thus, we propose a method for modeling such complex system. This method is based on AML (Agent Modeling Language) that is a language well adapted for modeling multi-agent systems. We, then, present a spatial AML meta-model coupled with a method. The use case is the MIRO project.",,第3页.xls

506,Learning spatial and expertise distribution coordination in multiagent systems,2001,"The Reinforcement learning (RL) strategy used in single autonomous agent needs to be reconsidered and adapted to the multiagent environment. This implies that the strategy adopted should take into account the behavior of other agents to learn to perform effectively in a cooperative manner. In this paper, we present a coordination method based on the RL, which enables an agent to learn front observing the behavior of other agents and their effect on the common environment. The agents coordinate their actions by including other agents' location information within its visual field into their state vector. In this case, the agent is aware of its team as a form of geographical distribution. In addition, the reinforcement signal redefined to include portions of the rewards gained by nearby agents. Thus, each agent acts in a social way and the groups of agents with this reshaping reinforcement signal are learning to behave cooperatively by avoiding conflicts through expertise distribution.",,第3页.xls
507,Creating a Mixed Reality Common Operating Picture Across C2 Echelons for Human-Autonomy Teams,2020,"One of the most significant challenges for the emerging operational environment addressed by Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) is the exchange of information between personnel in operating environments. Making information available for leveraging at the appropriate echelon is essential for convergence, a key tenet of MDO. Emergent cross-reality (XR) technologies are poised to have a significant impact on the convergence of the information environment. These powerful technologies present an opportunity to not only enhance the situational awareness of individuals at the local tactical edge and the decision-maker at the global mission command (C2), but to intensely and intricately bridge the information exchanged across all echelons. Complimentarily, the increasing use of autonomy in MDO, from autonomous robotic agents in the field to decision-making assistance for C2 operations, also holds great promise for human-autonomy teaming to improve performance at all echelon levels. Traditional research examines, at most, a small subset of these problems. Here, we envision a system that sees human-robot teams operating at the local edge communicating with human-autonomy teams at the global operations level. Both teams use a mixed reality (MR) system for visualization and interaction with a common operating picture (COP) to enhance situational awareness, sensing, and communication {but with highly different purposes and considerations. By creating a system that bridges across echelons, we are able to examine these considerations to determine their impact on information shared bi-directionally, between the global (C2) and local (tactical) levels, in order to understand and improve autonomous agents teamed with humans at both levels. We present a prototype system that includes an autonomous robot operating with a human teammate sharing sensory data and action plans with, and receiving commands and intelligence information from, a tactical operations team commanding from a remote location. We examine the challenges and considerations in creating such a system, and present initial findings.",,第3页.xls
508,Human- Machine Situation Analysis by Design,2024,"For many years, there has been an interest to support human situation awareness through data automation tools and information fusion systems design that perform situation assessment. With large data ingestion and computing power support, machines can provide historical narrative presentations, information fusion estimation, and plausible future prediction. The tools and techniques are of interest within human-machine teaming (HMT) to combine user reasoning with analytical agents. Deployable HMT solutions require user evaluations, which should be conducted throughout the system design life cycle. Likewise, to determine which design solutions meet the user needs, a preliminary scaling is required to rank candidate solutions. This paper presents a notional approach for human-agent designs to support situational analysis evaluation highlighting user value selection through analytical hierarchy processing (AHP) of metrics developed from the Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST). The MAST AHP technique helps to rank situation analysis tools in development design, while the paper highlights one example from the Association of Chats to Tracks (ACT) that facilitates cognitive reasoning of situational scenarios.",,第3页.xls
509,Designing a family of coordination algorithms,1995,"Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organization or coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination mechanisms, called generalized partial global planning (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current task environment. We show that different combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the partial global planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP considers tasks with deadlines, it allows agent heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple levels of abstraction.",,第3页.xls

511,The Rationality of Sincere Software Agent in Task Completion,2016,"The ability of rational agents to work in a team is one of their special characteristics that can help achieve their shared goals. However, in certain conditions, conflict may occur in an agent society; especially if there are selfish agents. A selfish agent places the achievement of its own goal as the main priority in its actions. To strike a balance between the achievement of an agent's own goal and its shared goal, strong moral values should be instilled in software agent environments. Sincerity is one strong human moral values that has been proven to bring many benefits to human society and reduce selfish attitude. By adapting human sincere behaviour, conflicts in software agent society could be mitigated. Sincerity behaviour can also influence a software agent to be more rational in its action and sensitive to its work environment. In our work, we study the situations in which software agents demonstrate sincere behavior in task performances. This paper proposes algorithms of sincere actions of rational agents when completing a given task.",,第3页.xls
512,Incentives to share knowledge,2001,"The knowledge required for decision making in a firm is distributed across various departments. In practice, cross-functional teams are used to integrate this distributed knowledge. Incentive schemes are of crucial importance to encourage departments to share knowledge. The authors study different incentive schemes by means of a two stage model. In the first step departments have to choose between learning and sharing knowledge, in the second stage, they bargain about a new product feature. The outcome of the bargaining process in the second stage depends on the capabilities of the agents and their uncertainty about the opponent. The result of the second stage determines the agents' payoffs which in turn influence the time allocation. In a simulation study, we investigate different incentive systems and show to which extent a firm has to reward the sharing of knowledge in order to reach its overall objectives. Furthermore, we are able to derive an analytical solution for the bargaining process under uncertainty and compute Nash equilibria for a discrete set of possible actions.",,第3页.xls

We show how the agents, equipped with fuzzy similarity rules developed by the physicians on the team, collaborate to find similar patients in each agent's patient database.

514,Learning Strategic Group Formation for Coordinated Behavior in Adversarial Multi-Agent with Double DQN,2018,"We examine whether a team of agents can learn geometric and strategic group formations by using deep reinforcement learning in adversarial multi-agent systems. This is a significant point underlying the control and coordination of multiple autonomous and intelligent agents. While there are many possible approaches to solve this problem, we are interested in fully end-to-end learning method where agents do not have any prior knowledge of the environment and its dynamics. In this paper, we propose a scalable and distributed double DQN framework to train adversarial multi-agent systems. We show that a large number of agents can learn to cooperatively move, attack and defend themselves in various geometric formations and battle tactics like encirclement, guerrilla warfare, frontal attack, flanking maneuver, and so on. We finally show that agents create an emergent and collective flocking behaviors by using local views from the environment only.",,第3页.xls
515,Order Matters: Generating Progressive Explanations for Planning Tasks in Human-Robot Teaming,2021,"Prior work on generating explanations in a planning context has focused on providing the rationale behind an AI agent's decision-making. While these methods offer the right explanations, they fail to heed the cognitive requirement of understanding an explanation from the explainee or human's perspective. In this work, we set out to address this issue by considering the order for communicating information in an explanation, or the progressiveness of making explanations. Progression is the notion of building complex concepts on simpler ones, which is known to benefit learning. In this work, we investigate a similar effect when an explanation is composed of multiple parts that are communicated sequentially. The challenge here lies in determining the order for receiving different parts of an explanation that would assist in understanding. Given the sequential nature, a formulation based on goal-based MDP is presented. The reward function of this MDP is learned via inverse reinforcement learning based on training data. We evaluated our approach in an escape-room domain to demonstrate its effectiveness. Upon analyzing the results, it revealed that the desired order arises strongly from both domain-dependent and independence features. This result confirmed our expectation that the process of understanding an explanation for planning tasks was progressive and context dependent. We also showed that the explanations generated using the learned rewards achieved better task performance and simultaneously reduced cognitive load. These results shed light on designing explainable robots across various domains.",,第3页.xls
516,A formal open framework based on agent for testing Web applications,2007,"This work employs and extends the Gaia methodology to design a formal open framework based on agent for automatically testing Web applications. In our framework, each test task corresponds to a role and the agent takes this role to achieve its test task or cooperates by interaction with other agent to finish the test tasks. The agent can not only join or leave agent society at will, but also take or release roles at run time dynamically. Our framework can be extended easily by adding new roles to provide much more junction. At the same time, agents and roles are loosely coupled; role classes and agent classes can be designed at the same time by different teams. The internal design of multi-agent system (MAS) is independent of the Web applications. This framework helps to implement automatically testing of Web applications.",,第3页.xls

518,Real Time State Detection of a Foosball Game Using CNN-Based Computer Vision,2024,"Abstractions of the game of football serve as well-known challenges in AI research. A particularly accessible abstraction is the game of Foosball where one team is operated by an AI agent while the other side is controlled by humans. In Foosball, the dynamics can be described by a few descriptive parameters, namely the shift and rotation of the corresponding rods plus the position of the ball. In this work, we present a Computer Vision based real time game state detector in a real-world setup with an automated Foosball table (constructed by Bosch Rexroth AG). More precisely, we train an object detector network based on YOLOX to detect the positions of the figures and an image regressor network based on ResNet18 to predict the rotation angles. For the derivation of the training data we propose a semi-supervised labeling approach based on classical Computer Vision. We evaluate the proposed approach and find that our methodology works in the sense of a proof of concept.

It is expensive to solve similar construction design problems from first principles. However, in practice designers and estimators reuse previous designs and estimates. The research described examines issues involved in the integration of many disciplines in construction with the use of case-based reasoning techniques for the reuse of designs and estimates. It describes a perspective-based hierarchical case memory structure and a series of indexing methods for multi-stage retrieval. Construction projects are organised in to domain cases consisting of a hierarchy of meta, perspective and sub cases. Design and estimating cases selected for reuse are adapted with the use of sub-cases and domain specific adaptation rules. A prototype system NIRMANI (meaning designer in Sinhalese) is currently being implemented encapsulating the case memory organisation and retrieval strategies described. This multi-agent system provides a common platform for a design team to support collaborative design.",,第3页.xls
520,Modeling dynamic engineering design processes in PSI,2005,"One way to make engineering design effective and efficient is to make its processes flexible - i.e. self-adjusting, self-configuring, and self-optimizing at run time. This paper presents the descriptive part of the Dynamic Engineering Design Process (DEDP) modeling framework developed in the PSI, project. The project aims to build a software tool to assist managers to analyze and enhance the productivity of the DEDPs through process simulations. The framework incorporates the models of teams and actors, tasks and activities as well as design artifacts as the major interrelated parts. DEDPs are modeled as weakly defined flows of tasks and atomic activities which may only become apparent at run time because of several presented dynamic factors. The processes are self-formed through the mechanisms of collaboration in the dynamic team of actors. These mechanisms are based on several types of contracting negotiations. DEDP productivity is assessed by the Units of Welfare collected by the multi-agent system which models the design team. The models of the framework are formalized in the family of DEDP ontologies.",,第3页.xls

In the case of controlling a team of underwater vehicles, it is significant to examine different structures of multiagent systems for choosing the best one for a defined underwater task.In this paper, the operation results of three different structures (centralized, dispersed decentralized and hybrid) of multiagent control systems of underwater vehicles teams were presented.

522,Combining AI control systems and human decision support via robustness and criticality,2024,"AI-enabled capabilities are reaching the requisite level of maturity to be deployed in the real world. Yet, the ability of these systems to always make correct or safe decisions is a constant source of criticism and reluctance to use them. One way of addressing these concerns is to leverage AI control systems alongside and in support of human decisions, relying on the AI control system in safe situations while calling on a human co-decider for critical situations. Additionally, by leveraging an AI control system built specifically to assist in joint human/machine decisions, the opportunity naturally arises to then use human interactions to continuously improve the AI control system's accuracy and robustness.We extend a methodology for adversarial explanations (AE) to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning frameworks, including MuZero. Multiple improvements to the base agent architecture are proposed. We demonstrate how this technology has two applications: for intelligent decision tools and to enhance training / learning frameworks. In a decision support context, adversarial explanations help a user make the correct decision by highlighting those contextual factors that would need to change for a different AI-recommended decision. As another benefit of adversarial explanations, we show that the learned AI control system demonstrates robustness against adversarial tampering. Additionally, we supplement AE by introducing strategically similar autoencoders (SSAs) to help users identify and understand all salient factors being considered by the AI system. In a training / learning framework, this technology can improve both the AI's decisions and explanations through human interaction. Finally, to identify when AI decisions would most benefit from human oversight, we tie this combined system to our prior art on statistically verified analyses of the criticality of decisions at any point in time.",,第3页.xls
523,A concurrent engineering environment for chemical manufacturing,1995,"Design and operation of process plants are now dominated by constraints imposed by safety, environmental impact, waste minimization, cost effectiveness, controllability, and operability over the complete product and process life cycle including market analysis, conceptual and detailed design through to commissioning, operation, and disposal of products and decommissioning of the plant. This means it inevitably involves a large number of activities carried out by teams of engineers which draw on a variety of technologies that rely on diverse types of information having complex data structures and relationships which must be shared by team members and integrated through computer based software packages. Conflicting goals, uncertainty, and multiple solutions are crucial elements of these activities which are essentially about decision making. This paper describes the architectural and functional characteristics of a computer integrated concurrent engineering environment for life cycle chemical manufacturing which allows project teams to work over a heterogeneous computer network. Emphasis is placed on the key implementation issues with specific attention being paid to STEP-based chemical process data modelling, information sharing and communication, and distributed agent cooperation. The benefits this approach can bring are illustrated by considering the revamp design of a refinery fluid catalytic cracking process, particularly in respect to the way the environment supports the project team.",,第3页.xls
524,Reducing Aircraft Accidents: Can Intelligent Agent Paradigms Help?,2008,"It is suggested that at least 70% of aircraft accidents can be shown to have flight crew error as the major causal factor. These errors can be categorized into two domains, technical flight skill errors and non-technical flight skill errors. This paper will summarize two intelligent agent paradigms, being developed by the KES/AERO research group, that operate within both the technical and non-technical flight skill domains. The first paradigm describes three intelligent agents, two situated in the cockpit and one situated at the aerodrome, which function as a team. The second paradigm describes a single intelligent agent which functions in the education and training domain where inappropriate, and potentially unsafe, flight skills are first learned These intelligent agents are designed to operate as either improvements to flight deck automation or additional flight crew.",,第3页.xls
525,Decision making by the characteristics and the interaction in multi-agent robotics soccer,1998,"This paper deals with a decentralized decision-making method on multi-agent robotic system. Soccer game is adopted as an example for its dynamic characteristics. The soccer simulator has been designed and implemented which enables us to test various approaches to the multiagent studies. The modeling of capabilities of a single robot and team strategy is explained at first. Each robotic agent has different characteristics, and the decision-making by each robotic agents are done by considering its characteristics and interaction between robotic agents. Several simulation experiments with different combinations of the components and formations have been tested. The result of the simulation experiments was that similar combination of the components resulted in better performance, and the formation where robotic agents are located in the center axis between the goals showed better defense behaviors.",,第3页.xls
526,Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding in Large-Scale Warehouses [arXiv],2020,"Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of moving a team of agents to their goal locations without collisions. In this paper, we study the lifelong variant of MAPF where agents are constantly engaged with new goal locations, such as in large-scale warehouses. We propose a new framework for solving lifelong MAPF by decomposing the problem into a sequence of Windowed MAPF instances, where a Windowed MAPF solver resolves collisions among the paths of the agents only within a finite time horizon and ignores collisions beyond it. Our framework is particularly well suited to generating pliable plans that adapt to continually arriving new goal locations. Theoretically, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of our framework. Empirically, we evaluate our framework with a variety of MAPF solvers and show that it can produce high-quality solutions for up to 1,000 agents, significantly outperforming existing methods.",,第3页.xls
527,Adaptive coordination among fuzzy reinforcement learning agents performing distributed dynamic load balancing,2002,"In this paper we present an adaptive multi-agent coordination algorithm applied to the problem of distributed dynamic load balancing. As a specific example, we consider the problem of dynamic web caching in the Internet. In our general formulation of this problem, each agent represents a mirrored piece of content that tries to move itself closer to areas of the network with a high demand for this item. Each agent in our model uses a fuzzy rulebase for choosing the optimal direction of motion and adjusts the parameters of this rulebase using reinforcement learning. The resulting architecture for multi-agent coordination among fuzzy reinforcement learning agents (MAC-FRL) allows the team of agents to adaptively redistribute its members in the environment to match the changing pattern of demand. We simulate the performance of MAC-FRL and show that it significantly improves performance over non-coordinating agents.",,第3页.xls

The project team's work focused heavily on the introduction of design and manufacturing constraint information early in the product development lifecycle. Since conventional aircraft development efforts are highly inefficient for identifying and managing product requirements and design constraints, a development team's ability to effectively evaluate proposed design solutions can be negatively impacted. This project's work employed three main technologies to accomplish its vision of greatly improving the design of aircraft components: (1) intelligent agent technology to streamline coordination between development team resources: (2) Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) technology to allow for rapid design exploration and optimization; and (3) the introduction of design evaluation for manufacturing process constraints at the preliminary stage of design using a natural language processing representation known as Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS). This paper provides motivation for the MADEsmart project's research, an overview of each of its three main focus areas. a more detailed description of each of the technology applications, and some concluding remarks.",,第3页.xls
530,From Spoken Words to Prompt Triggers: Technical Iterations of a Semi-Intelligent Conversational Agent to Promote Early Literacy,2023,"AI technology is rapidly evolving and has vast potential for educational applications. This paper focuses on the technical iterations that took place as our project team developed a semi-intelligent conversational agent (CA) that uses speech recognition to fire spoken prompts to promote caregiver-child interaction as they read books aloud together. Situating this work in a design-based research methodology, the technical iterations reported here are part of the iterative build phase. (Easterday et al., 2018; Hoadley & Campos, 2022). The CA app promotes conversations between caregivers and children by listening to the human dyads as they read, matching their spoken words to marker words that would pinpoint the page of the storybook the dyads are reading, and playing a prompt corresponding to the page. The dynamic system that supports the app involves multiple components: web accessible services, data processing services, and human outputs, and it has gone through a combined seven iterations in three prototypes. Though a very small part of the DBR cycle, the technical iterations presented here have the potential to inform others interested in incorporating text-to-speech and other AI technologies into educational applications.

The author has created a platform of multi-agent simulations called Atom Talk in order to model agent interaction in a fragmented space (Bousquet, 1994; Cambier, 1994). The author has also examined the problem of modelling diverse representations, ranging from those of the actors of the world being studied to disciplinary points of view of the researchers involved. The problem of representation is inherent in the creation of artificial worlds where agents interact with their natural and social environment. In this paper the author discusses the representation problem from his modeller point of view. The author gives some examples of the models he has created. More precisely, the author examines the question of the place and status of representations when an attempt is made to simulate circular relationships linking individual and social group levels within the ecosystem.

533,Multiagent Fully Decentralized Value Function Learning With Linear Convergence Rates,2021,"This article develops a fully decentralized multiagent algorithm for policy evaluation. The proposed scheme can be applied to two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, a collection of agents have distinct datasets gathered by following different behavior policies (none of which is required to explore the full state space) in different instances of the same environment and they all collaborate to evaluate a common target policy. The network approach allows for efficient exploration of the state space and allows all agents to converge to the optimal solution even in situations where neither agent can converge on its own without cooperation. The second scenario is that of multiagent games, in which the state is global and rewards are local. In this scenario, agents collaborate to estimate the value function of a target team policy. The proposed algorithm combines off-policy learning, eligibility traces, and linear function approximation. The proposed algorithm is of the variance-reduced kind and achieves linear convergence with O(1) memory requirements. The linear convergence of the algorithm is established analytically and simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.",,第3页.xls
534,A World Wide Web approach for capturing and deploying preferences over the Internet,1997,"A primary task of engineering design is to resolve the conflicting objectives that are inherent in the design process. As a result, design-automation tools must provide designers with the ability to represent and apply the preferential knowledge required to resolve conflicting objectives. This paper describes the ACME DecisionBot, a WWW-based tool for capturing and applying the preferential knowledge required to resolve design conflicts. Based on user input, the DecisionBot synthesizes an imprecise value function, which accurately captures the user's preferences for a task. An engineering-design tool can apply this preferential knowledge by way of an objective function approximation, by linking in a library of routines for evaluating design alternatives, or through direct interaction with the DecisionBot. Possible applications for concurrent engineering include incorporating the imprecise value function into the quality function deployment process, and representing the perspectives of team members for team-based design situations.",,第3页.xls
535,Dynamically formed heterogeneous robot teams performing tightly-coordinated tasks,2006,"As we progress towards a world where robots play an integral role in society, a critical problem that remains to be solved is the Pickup Team Challenge; that is, dynamically formed heterogeneous robot teams executing coordinated tasks where little information is known a priori about the tasks, the robots, and the environments in which they will operate. Successful solutions to forming pickup teams will enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams. In this paper, we define the challenge of pickup teams and propose the treasure hunt domain for evaluating the. performance of pickup teams. Additionally, we describe a basic implementation of a pickup team that can search and discover treasure in a previously unknown environment. We build on prior approaches in market-based task allocation and plays for synchronized task execution, to allocate roles amongst robots in the pickup team, and to execute synchronized team actions to accomplish the treasure hunt task.",,第3页.xls

Although this paper will be focused on a space-based BMC2 system, the architecture and algorithms presented are equally useable in the air, surface, and under the surface domains. The purpose of the BMC2 systems architecture is to enable the design, development, and discovery of cooperative, multi-agent decision policies that are applicable to unrestricted, degraded, disrupted, and denied communication environments. Current technical approaches in this area tend to be heuristic. A Stochastic Games (SG) theoretical approach will be employed for modeling simultaneous, zero-sum, two team engagements involving multiple blue agents & red opponents based on Multi-Stage, Markov Stochastic Games (MSMSG).

538,An agent-based simulation for multi-UAVs coordinative sensing,2008,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a model developed for emergent formation of multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into functional teams that cooperatively complete a mission in which they search for specific mobile targets and escape obstacles. Design/methodology/approach - The design and development of distributed UAVs simulator use agent-based platform employing a decentralized control which follows the flocking behavior-based design philosophy. Findings - The results of the simulation indicate that the emergent behavior-based search procedure for UAVs is autonomous, effective and robust. It is especially well suited for emergent teams to quickly solve dynamic teaming and task allocation. Practical implications - The development of a UAV is expensive, and a small error in automatic control results in a crash. Therefore, the platform is useful to develop and verify the coordination behavior of UAVs through software simulation prior to real testing. Originality/value - The proposed emergent behavior simulated environment is working on an agent-based UAV simulated platform, and hence, it naturally adapts to the behavior of a distributed and concurrent situation.

We define a behavior-based system relying on automatic design process using artificial evolution to synthesize high level behaviors for autonomous agents. Behavioral strategies are described by tree-based structures, and manipulated by genetic evolving processes. Each strategy is dynamically evaluated during simulation, and is weighted by an adaptation function as a quality factor that reflects its relevance as good solution for the learning task. It is computed using heterogeneous reinforcement techniques associating immediate reinforcements and delayed reinforcements as dynamic progress estimators.",,第3页.xls
540,Multiagent teamwork: analyzing the optimality and complexity of key theories and models,2002,"Despite the significant progress in multiagent teamwork, existing research does not address the optimality of its prescriptions nor the complexity of the teamwork problem. Thus, we cannot determine whether the assumptions and approximations made by a particular theory gain enough efficiency to justify the losses in overall performance. To provide a tool for evaluating this tradeoff, we present a unified framework, the COMmunicative Multiagent Team Decision Problem (COM-MTDP) model, which is general enough to subsume many existing models of multiagent systems. We analyze use the COM-MTDP model to provide a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing optimal teams under problem domains divided along the dimensions of observability and communication cost. We then exploit the COM-MTDP's ability to encode existing teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of joint intentions theory, including STEAM. We then derive a domain-independent criterion for optimal communication and provide a comparative analysis of the two joint intentions instantiations. We have implemented a reusable, domain-independent software package based COM-MTDPs to analyze teamwork coordination strategies, and we demonstrate its use by encoding and evaluating the two joint intentions strategies within an example domain.",,第3页.xls
541,Learning co-ordination by spatial and expertise distribution in multi-agent systems,2002,"There is an interest in multiple agents engaged in collective behavior. Reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems needs to take into account the behavior of other agents in order to perform effectively. Acting selfishly by agents is not sufficient to arrive at a global optimal strategy. Cooperation among agents during learning is essential in directing the adjustment of policies in the globally most beneficial direction. We present coordination methods based on reinforcement learning, which enables an agent to learn by observation of the other agents and their effect on the common environment. Thus, the agents coordinate their actions by including location information about the other agents within the visual field into their state vector. In this case, the agent is aware of its team as a form of geographical distribution. In addition, we reshape the reinforcement signal since, an agent, as well as receiving rewards from its own actions, receives a portion of the reward given by nearby agents. Thus, each agent acts in a social way and the groups of agents with this reshaping reinforcement signal are learning to behave cooperatively by avoiding conflicts through expertise distribution.",,第3页.xls

543,Searching for a black hole in arbitrary networks: optimal mobile agents protocols,2006,"Consider a networked environment, supporting mobile agents, where there is a black hole: a harmful host that disposes of visiting agents upon their arrival, leaving no observable trace of such a destruction. The black hole search problem is the one of assembling a team of asynchronous mobile agents, executing the same protocol and communicating by means of whiteboards, to successfully identify the location of the black hole; we are concerned with solutions that are generic (i.e., topology-independent). We establish tight bounds on the size of the team (i.e., the number of agents), and the cost (i.e., the number of moves) of a size-optimal solution protocol. These bounds depend on the a priori knowledge the agents have about the network, and on the consistency of the local labelings. In particular, we prove that: with topological ignorance Delta + 1 agents are needed and suffice, and the cost is Delta + 1), where Delta + 1 is the maximal degree of a node and n is the number of nodes in the network; with topological ignorance but in presence of sense of direction only two agents suffice and the cost is Theta(n(2)); and with complete topological knowledge only two agents suffice and the cost is Theta(n log n). All the upper-bound proofs are constructive.",,第3页.xls
544,Efficient Behavior Learning Based on State Value Estimation of Self and Others,2008,"The existing reinforcement learning methods have been seriously Suffering from the curse of the dimension problem, especially when they are applied to multiagent dynamic environments. One of the typical examples is a case of RoboCup competitions since other agents and their behavior easily cause state and action space variations. This paper presents a method of modular learning in a multiagent environment by which the learning agent can acquire cooperative behavior with its teammates and competitive behavior against its opponents. The key ideas to resolve the issue are as follows. First, a two-layer hierarchical system with multilearning modules is adopted to reduce the size of the sensor and action spaces. The state space of the top layer consists of the state values from the lower level and the macro actions are used to reduce the size of the physical action space. Second, the stale of the other, to what extent it is close to its own goal, is estimated by observation and used as a state variable in the top layer state space to realize the cooperative/competitive behavior. The method is applied to a four (defense team)-on-five (offense team) game task and the learning agent (a passer of the offense team) successfully acquired the teamwork plays (pass and shoot) within much shorter learning time.

545,Tools for enabling teaming during mission planning and rehearsal,2020,"The Army anticipates that future battles will be in more complex and dynamic environments, requiring the Army to push modernization priorities. In order for Soldiers to thrive within these challenging operational contexts, they must rapidly adapt to leverage and integrate technology in order to gain and maintain overmatch over near peer adversaries. Teaming will be especially critical for mission success. Soldier teams will need to be adaptive and fluid in their roles to respond to dynamic mission demands. Technology can be leveraged to enable and enhance teaming between human and human-agent teams. Augmented reality (AR) technology may provide an adaptive solution for information sharing across individuals and teams to promote a common operational picture within future operational environments. Here, we present a small teams study where dyads leveraged technological tools that helped facilitate teaming during a simulated mission planning and rehearsal scenario. Partners worked together to plan a path to extract a high value target while avoiding obstacles and hostile forces. Dyads completed missions using two technologies counterbalanced across the study. The first condition was reflective of current methods for mission planning in the Army; dyads used a Table Top to plan, rehearse, and execute the simulated mission. In the second condition, dyads used the Microsoft HoloLens to complete the mission in an augmented reality environment. This paper will present findings of how perceived teaming efficacy and performance relate to mission performance and workload in the two technologies.",,第3页.xls
546,Absorption and translocation of glyphosate isopropylamine and trimethylsulfonium salts in Abutilon theophrasti and Setaria faberi,2000,"Growth chamber and laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate foliar absorption and translocation of the isopropylamine (Ipa) or trimethylsulfonium (Tms) salts of glyphosate in Abutilon theophrasti and Setaria faberi. Glyphosate was applied at 250 g ai ha(-1). Absorption of C-14-glyphosate in both formulations increased similarly in both species over 72 h. Seventy-two hours after treatment (HAT), A. theophrasti absorbed 26% of applied C-14 of both formulations, whereas S. faberi absorbed 43% of both formulations. The addition of 1% ammonium sulfate (AMS) to both formulations increased the amount of herbicide absorbed to 35% in A. theophrasti and 60% in S. faberi 72 HAT. Translocation of absorbed C-14-glyphosate in both formulations (with or without AMS) was greater for S. faberi than A. theophrasti 72 HAT. For A. theophrasti, 17% of C-14 absorbed in Ipa and Tms formulations were translocated out of the treated leaf, whereas additions of AMS increased the amount translocated to 25 and 23% for Ipa and Tms, respectively. The largest portion of translocated C-14 moved to tissues above the treated leaf. For S. faberi, 37% of absorbed C-14 in both Ipa and Tms formulations were translocated out of the treated leaf 72 HAT, whereas 42% translocated when 1% AMS was added to both formulations. In S. faberi, the largest portion of C-14-glyphosate translocated to tissues below the treated leaf. In summary, no differences were found between Ipa and Tms formulations in both weed species.",,第3页.xls

549,Efficiency and robustness of threshold-based distributed allocation algorithms in multi-agent systems,2002,"We present three scalable, fully distributed, threshold-based algorithms for allocating autonomous embodied workers to a given task whose demand evolves dynamically over time. Individuals estimate the availability of work based solely on local perceptions. The differences among the algorithms lie in the threshold distribution among teammates (homogeneous or heterogeneous team), in the mechanism used for establishing threshold values (fixed, parameter-based or variable, rule-based), and in the sharing (public) or not sharing (private) of demand estimations through local peer-to-peer communication. We tested the algorithms' efficiency and robustness in a collective manipulation case study concerned with the clustering of initially scattered small objects. The aggregation experiment has been studied at two different experimental levels using a microscopic model and embodied simulations. Results show that teams using a number of active workers dynamically controlled by one of the allocation algorithms achieve similar or better performances in aggregation than those characterized by a constant team size while using on average a considerably reduced number of agents over the whole aggregation process. While differences in efficiency among the algorithms are small, differences in robustness are much more apparent. Threshold variability and peer-to-peer communication appear to be two key mechanisms for improving worker allocation robustness against environmental perturbations.",,第3页.xls

This paper introduces SAIL, a design method and framework for the development of HMT-concepts. Starting point of SAIL is that an HMT can be developed in an iterative process in which an existing autonomous system is enhanced with social functions tailored to the specific context. The SAIL framework consists of a modular social layer between autonomous systems and human team members, in which all social capabilities can be implemented to enable teamwork. Within SAIL, HMT-modules are developed that construct these social capabilities. The modules are reusable in multiple domains.Next to introducing SAIL we demonstrate the method and framework using a proof of concept task, from which we conclude that the method is a promising approach to design, implement and evaluate HMT-concepts.",,第3页.xls
551,Understanding the dynamics of state-problems in distributed and collaborative design process,2007,"The implementation of multi-agents systems aided collaborative and distributed design requires a deeper understanding of the real interactions between actors, inside of the multidisciplinary teams. In this view, it is considered that for the implementation of these systems, it is necessary to observe, model, and analyze this process with finer granularities levels. This study presents an approach of collaborative and distributed design process analysis. The core of this approach is the modeling of interactions between actors during the design process. The approach consists in discerning, from the real interactions and the emergence of concepts, the different characteristic state-problems of the collaborative and distributed design process. The analysis of state-problems, in a real experience of collaborative and distributed design process, shows that their dynamics is rather characterized by the numerous irregular leaps. These leaps, probably unforeseeable, show that the design process is far from harmonious. Indeed, these leaps depend strongly on either the structural causes, as the auto-organization inside the group, or on the human actions, as the creative character of the design process.",,第3页.xls
552,Reinforcement learning of coordination in heterogeneous cooperative multi-agent systems,2004,"Most approaches to the learning of coordination in multi-agent systems (MAS) to date require all agents to use the same learning algorithm with similar (or even the same) parameter settings. In today's open networks and high inter-connectivity such an assumption becomes increasingly unrealistic. Developers are starting to have less control over the agents that join the system and the learning algorithms they employ. This makes effective coordination and good learning performance extremely difficult to achieve, especially in the absence of learning agent standards. In this paper we investigate the problem of learning to coordinate with heterogeneous agents. We show that an agent employing the FMQ algorithm, a recently developed multi-agent learning method, has the ability to converge towards the optimal joint action when teamed-up with one or more simple Q-learners. Specifically, we show such convergence in scenarios where simple-Q-learners alone are unable to converge towards an optimum. Our results show that system designers may improve learning and coordination performance by adding a smart agent to the MAS.",,第3页.xls

554,Multi-agent systems for adaptive multi-user interactive system design: some issues of research,1999,"It is well-known that the quality of human-machine interfaces (HMI) is a crucial element in order to design efficient interactive systems. It is particularly true in complex industrial systems where use constraints could be severe for safety, economic or production reasons. In this context, and according to (Browne, Totterdell and Norman, 1990), the reasons for developing an adaptive user interface (AUI) are: to extend systems lifespan, widen system's user base, enable user goals, satisfy user wants, improve operational accuracy, increase operational speed, reduce operational learning, enhance user understanding. Within the frame of AUI in multi-user complex industrial systems, many subgoals may appear such as: be easy to learn and use by the different users, be efficient at use (according with the various tasks and objectives of the users), be tolerant to certain human errors or decrease the ratio of errors (for each type of user), enhance cooperative team work, and so on. The paper first presents some criteria for adaptive behavior of interactive systems. Then, some issues for adaptivity from a multi-agent systems (MAS) standpoint are discussed.",,第3页.xls
555,Team GAMMA: agent programming on Gaea,1998,"We are developing a new software methodology for building large, complicated systems out of simple units (Nakashima, 1991). The emphasis is on the architecture used to combine the units, rather than on the intelligence of individual units. We call the methodology organic programming, referring to the characteristics of organic systems, context dependency and partial specification. Our approaches toward those characteristics are situatedness and reflection. Situatedness corresponds to the former characteristic, and reflection to the latter. We describe an application of the organic programming language, Gaea, to the programming of players of a multi-agent game, soccer. Our approach to multi-agent systems is recursive. Each agent is programmed in a multi-agent way. In programing a complex agent like a soccer player, we need various kinds of mechanisms of mode-change, interruption and emergency exit. We propose a dynamic subsumption architecture as a flexible methodology to realize such mechanisms.",,第3页.xls
556,Multi-agent task allocation for harvest management.,2022,"Multi-agent task allocation methods seek to distribute a set of tasks fairly amongst a set of agents. In real-world settings, such as soft fruit farms, human labourers undertake harvesting tasks. The harvesting workforce is typically organised by farm manager(s) who assign workers to the fields that are ready to be harvested and team leaders who manage the workers in the fields. Creating these assignments is a dynamic and complex problem, as the skill of the workforce and the yield (quantity of ripe fruit picked) are variable and not entirely predictable. The work presented here posits that multi-agent task allocation methods can assist farm managers and team leaders to manage the harvesting workforce effectively and efficiently. There are three key challenges faced when adapting multi-agent approaches to this problem: (i) staff time (and thus cost) should be minimised; (ii) tasks must be distributed fairly to keep staff motivated; and (iii) the approach must be able to handle incremental (incomplete) data as the season progresses. An adapted variation of Round Robin (RR) is proposed for the problem of assigning workers to fields, and market-based task allocation mechanisms are applied to the challenge of assigning tasks to workers within the fields. To evaluate the approach introduced here, experiments are performed based on data that was supplied by a large commercial soft fruit farm for the past two harvesting seasons. The results demonstrate that our approach produces appropriate worker-to-field allocations. Moreover, simulated experiments demonstrate that there is a sweet spot with respect to the ratio between two types of in-field workers.",,第3页.xls
557,The CMTrio-98 Sony legged robot team,1999,"Sony has provided a remarkable platform for research and development in robotic agents, namely fully autonomous legged robots. In this paper, we describe our work using Sony's legged robots to participate in the RoboCup'98 legged robot demonstration and competition. The robots are fully autonomous with on-board vision, control, and navigation. The challenges we addressed in this framework include the color calibration of the vision hardware, the landmark-based robot localization on the playing field, and the development of robot behaviors for the actual play of the game. The paper presents our approach and contributions to these issues. We apply machine learning techniques for automated color calibration and we develop effective vision-servoed navigation.

559,Intelligent Algorithm for Assignment of Agents to Human Strategy in Centralized Multi-agent Coordination,2014,"Problem: Multi-agent coordination is an important issue in the domain of disaster emergency response operations where a team of agents (field units or robots) aims to achieve a joint objective. The responsibility of the Incident Commander (IC) is to (I) specify an effective strategy composed of a number of threads (a set of prioritized subproblems), (II) appropriately assign/allocate agents to these threads as a strategic decision, and (III) release agents in a timely manner from the assigned threads to adapt a strategic decision to a new situation. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to present an intelligent algorithm that assists a human in multi-agent coordination by providing two key functions: 1) automatically calculate and present a set of feasible alternatives for selecting a choice as a strategic decision in a definite time, and 2) autonomously and in a timely manner identify a subset of assigned agents that should be released from their threads in order to refine a strategic decision. Method: This algorithm expands a decision tree from a state node in which a thread (or several threads) has received a set of new agents from either the IC or a higher thread. Each thread is associated with one level of a decision tree with a number of nodes. A thread calculates a set of efficient coalitions using all the available agents and generates a new node for each coalition to show what agents are allocated to the thread and what agents are released into a lower thread. In real-time, this algorithm continuously observes and monitors the task environment to identify a subset of the assigned agents that cannot provide efficient capabilities for their threads and should be released for assignment to other threads. Results: To gather further insight, this paper applied this algorithm for team coordination to a simulated search & rescue scenario in an earthquake disaster-affected area where the teams goal was to rescue trapped people distributed in five operational zones. The result was an infinite set of alternative scenarios for a human-defined strategy. The calculated alternatives were presented to the IC for selection according to his intuition or for delegation to the system to determine an optimal strategy.",,第3页.xls
560,A general computational recognition primed decision model with multi-agent rescue simulation benchmark,2012,"Analytical decision making strategies rely on weighing pros and cons of multiple options in an unbounded rationality manner. Contrary to these strategies, recognition primed decision (RPD) model which is a primary naturalistic decision making (NDM) approach assumes that experienced and professional decision makers when encounter problems in real operating conditions are able to use their previous experiences and trainings in order to diagnose the problem, recall the appropriate solution, evaluate it mentally, and implement it to handle the problem in a satisficing manner. In this paper, a computational form of RPD, now called C-RPD, is presented. Unified Modeling Language was used as a modeling language to represent the proposed C-RPD model in order to make the implementation easy and obvious. To execute the model, RoboCup Rescue agent simulation environment, which is one of the best and the most famous complex and multi-agent large-scale environments, was selected. The environment simulates the incidence of fire and earthquakes in urban areas where it is the duty of the police forces, firefighters and ambulance teams to control the crisis. Firefighters of SOS team are first modeled and implemented by utilizing C-RPD and then the system is trained using an expert's experience. There are two evaluations. To find out the convergence of different versions developed during experience adding, some of the developed versions are chosen and evaluated on seven maps. Results show performance improvements. The SOS team ranked first in an official world championship and three official open tournaments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls
561,A layered approach for an autonomous robotic soccer system,1997,"As robots become more adept at operating in the real world, it becomes more important to build teams of robots, capable of high-level collaborative and adversarial planning and learning in real-time situations. Robotic soccer is an interesting emerging domain that is particularly appropriate for studying these issues (Kitano et al., 1995; Stone and Veloso, 1996; Kim, 1996). We have been pursuing research in this domain using both a simulator and real physical agents. We present the architecture of the physical system and introduce how actions are layered building upon each other to create strategic reasoning. We decompose the system's capabilities in different layers, namely behavioral, perceptual, and strategic. We view the strategic layer itself consisting of different levels. We have been using realistic simulation environments (Noda, 1995; Sahota, 1993) to learn basic collaborative strategic procedures. Our on-going research consists of extending and applying these robust strategic templates to the physical agents.",,第3页.xls
562,Computational models for multiagent coordination analysis: Extending distributed POMDP models,2003,"Recently researchers in multiagent systems have begun to focus on formal POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) models for analysis of multiagent coordination. However, prior work has mostly focused on analysis of communication, such as via the COM-MTDP (Communicative Markov Team Decision Problem) model. This paper provides two extensions to this prior work that goes beyond communication and analyzes other aspects of multiagent coordination. In particular, we first present a formal model called R-COM-MTDP that extends COM-MTDP to analyze team formation and reorganization algorithms. R-COM-MTDP enables a rigorous and systematic analysis of complexity-optimality tradeoffs in team (re)formation approaches in different domain types. It provides the worst-case complexity analysis of the team (re)formation under varying conditions, and illustrates under which conditions role decomposition can provide significant reductions in computational complexity. Next, we propose COM-MTDP as a formal framework to analyze DCSP (Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem) strategies for conflict resolution. Different DCSP strategies are mapped onto policies in the COM-MTDP model, and agents compare strategies by evaluating their mapped policies. Thus, the two COM-MTDP based methods could open the door to a range of novel analyses of multiagent team (re)formation, and facilitate automated selection of the most efficient strategy for a given situation.",,第3页.xls
563,Mixed-Initiative Human-Automated Agents Teaming: Towards a Flexible Cooperation Framework,2020,"The recent progress in robotics and artificial intelligence raises the question of the efficient artificial agents interaction with humans. For instance, artificial intelligence has achieved technical advances in perception and decision making in several domains ranging from games to a variety of operational situations, (e.g. face recognition [51] and firefighting missions [23]). Such advanced automated systems still depend on human operators as far as complex tactical, legal or ethical decisions are concerned. Usually the human is considered as an ideal agent, that is able to take control in case of automated (artificial) agent's limit range of action or even failure (e.g embedded sensor failures or low confidence in identification tasks). However, this approach needs to be revised as revealed by several critical industrial events (e.g. aviation and nuclear powerplant) that were due to conflicts between humans and complex automated system [13]. In this context, this paper reviews some of our previous works related to human-automated agents interaction driving systems. More specifically, a mixed-initiative cooperation framework that considers agents' non-deterministic actions effects and inaccuracies about the human operator state estimation. This framework has demonstrated convincing results being a promising venue for enhancing humanautomated agent(s) teaming.",,第3页.xls
564,An agent-based knowledge management system for collaborative software maintenance environment: design and evaluation,2012,"Software maintenance (SM) environment is highly complex, knowledge-driven and collaborative. Therefore, a Knowledge Management System (KMS) is critical to provide an environment for sharing and sustaining knowledge among members of SM community of practice (CoP). Based on earlier works on KMS framework for collaborative SM, an agent-based KMS prototype system called SM Collaborative Agent Team (SCAT) is designed and developed, to assist maintainers to share information and perform their SM activities. The aims of this paper are to discuss the design of SCAT and to evaluate SCAT's success as a KMS tool. Designing SCAT involves three major aspects: Multi Agent System (MAS) design, Combined Ontology of SM and Domain knowledge areas, and System design. For evaluation, SCAT was benchmark against another agent-based KMS prototype. A survey was conducted to gauge the responses of users and maintainers on the success of both KMS tools, based on Wu & Wang KMS Success model. The results of the survey are analyzed using Rasch rating-scale model to determine if SCAT fares better than Rodriguez. Based on t-test comparison on overall Rasch estimated measures, SCAT KMS is slightly better than Rodriguez KMS. Using Common Person Equating (CPE) plot, SCAT are better than Rodriguez KMS in several key areas. In future, SCAT could be enhanced to improve the weak areas.",,第3页.xls

In ExpertCop, the students (police officers) configure and allocate an available police force according to a selected geographic region and then interact with the simulation. The student interprets the results with the help of an intelligent tutor, the pedagogical agent, observing how crime behaves in the presence of the allocated preventive policing. The interaction between domain agents representing social entities as criminals and police teams drives the simulation. ExpertCop induces students to reflect on resource allocation.

567,An agent-based web services solution to collaborative product design,2004,"In today's global world, manufacturers are facing many challenges such as product design with distributed and collaborative workflows. Complexity in collaborative product design arises from the need to synthesize different perspectives of a problem. Specifically, dependency identification of the product design process, as well as integration and sharing of computing application among the design teams that are critical for efficiency of manufaambility. Web services are considered to be the key to collaborative product design through the Internet. Web services alone are passive whereas agents can provide alerts and updates when new information becomes available.

With this method, the noise interference of the simulation terrace was well restrained, and the action selection precision was improved much. The problem that the Q-table of the traditional Q-learning occupied too much memory was well done. Moreover, this method also improved the generalization capability of the system, decreased the time cost to learn, and met the real-time character of the competition better. It was applied to the experiment of the pass and shoot models in the simulation team, whose result shows the validity of the method.",,第3页.xls
570,Hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning,2001,"In this paper we investigate the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning to speed up the acquisition of cooperative multi-agent tasks. We extend the MAXQ framework to the multi-agent case. Each agent uses the same MAXQ hierarchy to decompose a task into sub-tasks. Learning is decentralized, with each agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform subtasks, which order to do them in, and how to coordinate with other agents. Coordination skills among agents are learned by using joint actions at the highest level(s) of the hierarchy. The Q-nodes at the highest level(s) of the hierarchy are configured to represent the joint task-action space among multiple agents. In this approach, each agent only knows what other agents are doing at the level of sub-tasks, and is unaware of lower level (primitive) actions. This hierarchical approach allows agents to learn coordination faster by sharing information at the level of sub-tasks, rather than attempting to learn coordination taking into account primitive joint state-action values. We apply this hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to a complex AGV scheduling task and compare its performance and speed with other learning approaches, including flat multi-agent, single agent using MAXQ selfish multiple agents using MAXQ, as well as several well-known AGV heuristics like first come first serve, highest queue first and nearest station first. We also compare the tradeoffs in learning speed vs. performance of modeling joint action values at multiple levels in the MAXQ hierarchy.",,第3页.xls

572,"Inferring Trust From Users' Behaviours; Agents' Predictability Positively Affects Trust, Task Performance and Cognitive Load in Human-Agent Real-Time Collaboration.",2021,"Collaborative virtual agents help human operators to perform tasks in real-time. For this collaboration to be effective, human operators must appropriately trust the agent(s) they are interacting with. Multiple factors influence trust, such as the context of interaction, prior experiences with automated systems and the quality of the help offered by agents in terms of its transparency and performance. Most of the literature on trust in automation identified the performance of the agent as a key factor influencing trust. However, other work has shown that the behavior of the agent, type of the agent's errors, and predictability of the agent's actions can influence the likelihood of the user's reliance on the agent and efficiency of tasks completion. Our work focuses on how agents' predictability affects cognitive load, performance and users' trust in a real-time human-agent collaborative task. We used an interactive aiming task where participants had to collaborate with different agents that varied in terms of their predictability and performance. This setup uses behavioral information (such as task performance and reliance on the agent) as well as standardized survey instruments to estimate participants' reported trust in the agent, cognitive load and perception of task difficulty. Thirty participants took part in our lab-based study. Our results showed that agents with more predictable behaviors have a more positive impact on task performance, reliance and trust while reducing cognitive workload. In addition, we investigated the human-agent trust relationship by creating models that could predict participants' trust ratings using interaction data. We found that we could reliably estimate participants' reported trust in the agents using information related to performance, task difficulty and reliance. This study provides insights on behavioral factors that are the most meaningful to anticipate complacent or distrusting attitudes toward automation. With this work, we seek to pave the way for the development of trust-aware agents capable of responding more appropriately to users by being able to monitor components of the human-agent relationships that are the most salient for trust calibration.",,第3页.xls
573,Incorporating software agents in automated personal software process (PSP) tools,2009,"The PSP-expert visualization agent (EVA) is designed for software engineers specifically to introduce the agent-oriented concept, as well as to automate all the processes and fields involved in PSP. Currently, some developers of PSP automated tools include the agent's element in their system that focuses on sensor-based tracking of lines of code. However, none of them fully utilize this element for other purposes or provide the agent with a personal assistant for the software engineer. This sensor-based tracking is limited to Eclipse environments such as Java and is not compatible with the use of web platforms as a PSP automated tool. The PSP-EVA system is required to perform several tasks. There are three agents that exist within the system: Interface Agent (IA), TaskAgent (TA), and SearchAgent (SA). By incorporating the multi-software agent in this automation system, PSP-EVA is able to have ready-access to applications and also to provide a visual representation of performance to the user. Additionally, evaluation of software engineers and team performance can be easily derived and evaluated statistically.",,第3页.xls

It describes a cooperative learning support model based on a cooperation between intelligent agents in a distributed system. This model is founded on an explanation of the leader's task which may be assigned to a facilitating agent and the context in which this leadership occurs. Its originality arises from the fact that it is oriented not into the assistance provided to students, but rather into the assistance offered to any resource which has to facilitate both team and distance learning in a computer-supported tutoring environment.",,第3页.xls
576,Towards a more efficient computation of individual attribute and policy contribution for post-hoc explanation of cooperative multi-agent systems using Myerson values,2023,"A quantitative assessment of the global importance of an agent in a team is as valuable as gold for strategists, decision-makers, and sports coaches. Yet, retrieving this information is not trivial since in a cooperative task it is hard to isolate the performance of an individual from the one of the whole team. Moreover, it is not always clear the relationship between the role of an agent and his personal attributes. In this work we conceive an application of the Shapley analysis for studying the contribution of both agent policies and attributes, putting them on equal footing. Since the computational complexity is NP-hard and scales exponentially with the number of participants in a transferable utility coalitional game, we resort to exploiting a-priori knowledge about the rules of the game to constrain the relations between the participants over a graph. We hence propose a method to determine a Hierarchical Knowledge Graph of agents' policies and features in a Multi -Agent System. Assuming a simulator of the system is available, the graph structure allows to exploit dynamic programming to assess the importances in a much faster way. We test the proposed approach in a proof-of-case environment deploying both hardcoded policies and policies obtained via Deep Reinforcement Learning. The proposed paradigm is less computationally demanding than trivially computing the Shapley values and provides great insight not only into the importance of an agent in a team but also into the attributes needed to deploy the policy at its best.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

577,Conserving analyst attention units: use of multi-agent software and CEP methods to assist information analysis,2013,"Although the capability of computer-based artificial intelligence techniques for decision-making and situational awareness has seen notable improvement over the last several decades, the current state-of-the-art still falls short of creating computer systems capable of autonomously making complex decisions and judgments in many domains where data is nuanced and accountability is high. However, there is a great deal of potential for hybrid systems in which software applications augment human capabilities by focusing the analyst's attention to relevant information elements based on both a priori knowledge of the analyst's goals and the processing/correlation of a series of data streams too numerous and heterogeneous for the analyst to digest without assistance.Researchers at Penn State University are exploring ways in which an information framework influenced by Klein's (Recognition Primed Decision) RPD model, Endsley's model of situational awareness, and the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion process model can be implemented through a novel combination of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Multi-Agent Software (MAS). Though originally designed for stock market and financial applications, the high performance data-driven nature of CEP techniques provide a natural compliment to the proven capabilities of MAS systems for modeling naturalistic decision-making, performing process adjudication, and optimizing networked processing and cognition via the use of mobile agents. This paper addresses the challenges and opportunities of such a framework for augmenting human observational capability as well as enabling the ability to perform collaborative context-aware reasoning in both human teams and hybrid human /software agent teams.",,第3页.xls

If the situation is extrapolated to multiple robots, it results in multiple hypotheses for multiple robots. The localization is facilitated if the robots are actively guided towards locations where it can use other robots as well as obstacles to localize itself. This paper aims at presenting a learning technique for the above process of active localization of multiple robots by co-operation.

Computational tools should address not only the taskwork but also the teamwork emerging from the allocation. This paper describes a computational human agent model that manages work by executing or delaying the execution of the task, or by delegating activities to other agents. The agent considers its capacity and strategies for delegation to coordinate with other agents. Using a framework for simulating multiple types of agents, case studies apply this computational human agent model to the evaluation of a concept of operation that distributes work across an air traffic controller capable of delegating and flight deck crews.

580,Human-Centered Learning Engineering for the Emerging Intelligence Augmentation Economy,2022,"We explore the intersection of human-centered engineering design methodologies, applied learning sciences, and data (instrumentation & analytics) realized in the practice of learning engineering in response to an emerging intelligence augmentation economy. As the nature of human endeavor and productivity changes with the advancement of HCI and AI technologies we predict an intelligence augmentation economy will replace the knowledge economy. Just like the industrial economy and service economies before it, the IA economy will fundamentally change the nature of work and what people need to learn to be its contributors and beneficiaries.The demands of secondary and postsecondary education have already begun to shift from pre-career and preparation for life to mid-career adaptation, enrichment, and retraining [1]. The intelligence augmentation economy will require development of new skills for new kinds of collaborative work with intelligent agents. The lines between learning and working will blur, just as will the lines between the work of humans and the work of machines. Education institutions will be one source for life-long-learning in a world where work-embedded continuous adaptive learning is the norm.The learning engineering process provides a methodology for educational institutions and work-embedded training partners to engineer new kinds of learning experiences suited to the needs of the intelligence augmentation economy. These new learning experiences will take full advantage of technologies such as augmented reality and intelligent agents.We draw ideas from several chapters of theLearning Engineering Toolkit: Evidence-Based Practices from the Learning Sciences, Instructional Design, and Beyond[2]. We suggest a path to scaling HCI innovation through application of the learning engineering process to support a radically new future of learning and working in a new intelligence augmentation economy characterized by productivity gains through collaboration between people and intelligent agents.",,第3页.xls
581,Revisiting wavefront construction with collective agents: an approach to foraging,2014,"We consider the problem of coordinating a team of agents that have to collect disseminated resources in an unknown environment. We are interested in approaches in which agents collectively explore the environment and build paths between home and resources. The originality of our approach is to simultaneously build an artificial potential field (APF) around the agents' home while foraging. We propose a multi-agent model defining a distributed and asynchronous version of Barraquand et al. Wavefront algorithm. Agents need only to mark and read integers locally on a grid, that is, their environment. We prove that the construction converges to the optimal APF. This allows the definition of a complete parameter-free foraging algorithm, called c-marking agents. The algorithm is evaluated by simulation, while varying the foraging settings. Then we compare our approach to a pheromone-based algorithm. Finally, we discuss requirements for implementation in robotics.",,第3页.xls
582,An agent based model for trust and information sharing in networked systems,2012,"Vast amounts of information are generated, shared, and processed in tactical networks. In such systems, human cooperation is a crucial component for effective processing of information. However, human behavior is often mediated by social and organizational relationships, i.e. trust between team members and system level characteristics, such as network delays. The impact these different processes have on each other is not well understood. In this paper, we develop an agent based model for information sharing that incorporates trust into decision making. The nodes in our model are decision makers and are primarily responsible for the disambiguation of received information to obtain correct situation awareness as quickly as possible. Additionally, each node must share information with other nodes to enable the network to attain shared situation awareness. In our model, team members make trust evaluations for fellow team members that they cooperate with throughout a task. Most existing trust models concentrate on whether trust exists or not, and do not consider what task for which trust is being used. In contrast, we consider a new model of trust that incorporates two components: trust for competence and trust for throughput. In time constrained environments, both types of trust are crucial to mission success. Furthermore, this model allows us to study the impact of communication delays on overall trust. We also show how these trust values can be converted to labels that control agent's decision making behavior. To test out this proposed model, we use a command and control experiment platform called ELICIT (Experimental Laboratory for Investigating Collaboration, Information-sharing and Trust). We give initial experimental results that show how trust of nodes change in an ELICIT information sharing task for various settings of initial team trust, the biases of the nodes and possible communication channel disturbances.",,第3页.xls

585,A prototype of agent-based modeling platform for studying the evolution of scientific collaboration network,2010,"Recently scientific collaboration networks have become one hotspot in the complex network community. However, the studies on the dynamical evolution of the collaboration networks are insufficient; especially, few endeavors have been reported that combine the aspects of the network evolution and the knowledge creation and transfer. In the present paper, a dynamical modeling framework or meta-model that integrates the network evolution and knowledge transfer aspects is conceived, based on an analysis of a team-assembly-based model of scientific collaboration networks suggested by Guimera et al. Subsequently, a corresponding prototype of a computer simulation experimental platform is developed, in order to facilitate the researches on the network evolution and knowledge transfer in scientific collaboration networks using an agent-based modeling paradigm. A few modeling experiments have primitively validated the usefulness of the proposed meta-model as well as the corresponding platform prototype.",,第3页.xls
586,A Novel Collaboration and Communication Decision Based on Multi-agent in Wireless Sensor Network,2012,"Sensor nodes must work together to complete the task of WSN. Multi-agent and WSN have similar characteristics, so the theory of multi-agent has become the main methods to resolve WSN collaborative problems. First of all, in the paper WSN collaboration based on multi-agent is analyzed, and then the communication decision based on multi-agent is studied. In order to reduce the complexity of implementation of multi-agent collaboration strategy using the POMDP models, and decrease the amount of collaborative communication, a heuristic algorithm is presented. And communication is chosen only when an agent's observations indicate that the information will improve team's expected reward. The experimental results show that the presented approach can reduce communication, efficiently utilize communication bandwidth, and help improve system performance.",,第3页.xls

Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage communication approach where the agents co-ordinate via multiple rounds of communication before taking actions in the environment. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of cooperative multi-agent tasks, of varying difficulties, with varying number of agents, in a variety of environments ranging from 2D grid layouts of shapes and simulated traffic junctions to complex 3D indoor environments.

Various agent plans might conflict with respect to resources, services, and states of the world. Besides the obvious scalability issues, it might be wasteful and sometimes myopic to coordinate all possible agent behaviors. We describe the integration of a multilevel plan coordination algorithm, a reactive hierarchical-plan execution system, and a graphical user interface, which form a system capable of coordinating and caching for later reuse the hierarchical plans of agents in a multiagent domain. We have layered our integrated system on top of the Control of Agent-Based Systems (CoABS) Grid, a scalable, distributed network infrastructure that enables heterogeneous agents to interoperate in dynamic, mixed-initiative teams with human users.",,第3页.xls
590,A multi agent community of practice,2007,"Modern organizations tend to constitute of communities of practice to cover the side effect of standardization and centralization of knowledge. The distributed nature of knowledge in groups, teams and other departments of organization and complexity of this tacit knowledge lead us to use community of practice as an environment to share knowledge. In this paper we propose an agent mediated community of a practice system using MAS-CommonKADS methodology. We support the principle of autonomy since every single agent, even those in the same community, needs its own autonomy in order to model an organization and its individuals correctly, using this approach, the natural model for an agent based on knowledge sharing system has been resulted. We presented all models of MAS-CommonKADS methodology required for developing the multi-agent system. We found MAS-CommonKADS useful to design Knowledge Management applications. Because of detailed description of agents, a resulted design model could be simply implemented. We modeled our system using Rebeca and verified it to show that by use of our system, knowledge sharing can be satisfied.",,第3页.xls
591,Minefield Mapping Using Cooperative Multirobot Systems,2012,"This paper presents a team-theoretic approach to cooperative multirobot systems. The individual actions of the robots are controlled by the Belief-Desire-Intention model to endow the robots with the know-how needed to execute these actions deliberately. The cooperative behaviors between the heterogeneous robots are governed by the Team-Log theory to endow all the robots in the team with the know-how-to-cooperate and determine the team members commitments to each other despite their different types, properties, and goals. The proposed approach is tested for validity with the real life problem of minefield mapping. Different minefield sweeping strategies are studied to control the mobility of the mobile sweepers within the minefield in order to maximize the area coverage and improve picture compilation capability of the multirobot system.",,第3页.xls

When the leader and partners of virtual enterprise are in relation non-team and may exploit their information in an opportunistic way, in order to ensure virtual enterprise risk management carried out smoothly, the leader must develop effective risk control mechanism. The principal-agent theory and Distributed Decision-making (DDM) method are applied to solve the risk management of virtual enterprise with principal-agent characteristic and the principal-agent DDM risk management model of virtual enterprise is developed with one principal and multi-agent, analysis of the risk preference impact on decision-making.

594,Harnessing Supervised Learning Techniques for the Task Planning of Ambulance Rescue Agents,2016,"One of the challenging problems in Artificial Intelligence and Multi-Agent systems is the RoboCup Rescue project that was established in 2001. The Rescue Simulation provides a broad test bench for many algorithms and approaches in the field of AI. The Simulation presents three types of agents: police agents, fire brigade agents and ambulance agents. Each of them has a crucial role in the rescuing problem. The work presented in this paper focuses on the task planning of the ambulance team whose main role is rescuing the maximum number of civilians. It is obvious that this target is a complicated one due to the number of problems that the agent is faced with. One of the problems is estimating the time each civilian takes to die; the Estimated Time of Death (ETD). Realistic estimations of the ETD will lead to a better performance of the ambulance agents by planning their tasks accordingly. Supervised learning is our approach to learn and predict the ETD civilians leading to an optimized planning of the agents tasks.",,第3页.xls

596,Multi-agent framework for simulation of adaptive cooperative defense against Internet attacks,2007,"The paper proposes the framework for investigation of prospective adaptive and cooperative defense mechanisms against the Internet attacks. The approach suggested is based on the multi-agent modeling and simulation. According to the approach the defense and attack systems are represented as interacting teams of intelligent agents that act under some adaptation criterion. They adjust their configuration and behavior in compliance with the network conditions and attack (defense) severity. The paper represents the architecture and software implementation of simulation environment that combines discrete-event simulation, multi-agent approach and packet-level simulation of various Internet protocols.

597,A cultural algorithm framework to evolve multi-agent cooperation with evolutionary programming,1997,"Cultural algorithms have been previously used as a framework in which to evolve cooperative behavior within groups. Here they provide a framework within which to develop multi-agent cooperation among a group of soccer players. The current system is used to learn several types of plays: offensive and defensive. In addition, plays can be learned without opposition, passive opposition, or active opposition. The cultural algorithms with evolution programming were effective learning all of these plays within several hundred generations each. In general, defensive plays were harder to learn than offensive ones. But, defensive plays with active protagonists were easier to learn than those with passive protagonists. This may be due to the fact that active protagonists provide additional information for the team members to use in formulating their plays. In addition, successful learning involved a coordination of individual adjustments among participating agents. A description of these adjustments in terms of the belief space for these agents is given.",,第3页.xls
598,A Dataset Schema for Cooperative Learning from Demonstration in Multi-robot Systems,2020,"Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have been used to solve complex problems that demand intelligent agents working together to reach the desired goals. These Agents should effectively synchronize their individual behaviors so that they can act as a team in a coordinated manner to achieve the common goal of the whole system. One of the main issues in MASs is the agents' coordination; it is common for domain experts observing MASs execution to disapprove agents' decisions. Even if the MAS was designed using the best methods and tools for agents' coordination, this difference in decisions between experts and MAS is confirmed. Therefore, this paper proposes a new dataset schema to support learning the coordinated behavior in MASs from demonstration. The results of the proposed solution are validated in a Multi-Robot System (MRS) organizing a collection of new cooperative plan recommendations from the demonstration by domain experts.",,第3页.xls

To pursue this task, DEEPSIA is implemented using a multi-agent system, where components may, and effectively are, distributed in four countries (Brazil, Poland, Portugal and Spain). Being a system that uses the Internet and deals with critical information, a high security level is required.

600,Dynamic role assignment for multi-agent cooperation,2006,"In this paper, we introduce a dynamic role assignment mechanism for a team of cooperative virtual agents working in interactive computer games. This role assignment mechanism is a new one different from both existing static and dynamic mechanisms, in which decisions regarding role assignment are made all at once either in the design phase or in the execution phase. According to our mechanism, all situation-dependent role sets are predefined in the design phase. Detail decisions regarding which member agent has to take what specific role, however, are made in the execution phase. This mechanism can minimize the negotiation effort for role assignment in the execution phase. Therefore, this mechanism is quite effective in real-time multi-agent environments like interactive computer games. Through experiments, we show the superiority of our dynamic role assignment mechanism.",,第3页.xls
601,Resilient Distributed Recovery of Large Fields [arXiv],2019,"This paper studies the resilient distributed recovery of large fields under measurement attacks, by a team of agents, where each measures a small subset of the components of a large spatially distributed field. An adversary corrupts some of the measurements. The agents collaborate to process their measurements, and each is interested in recovering only a fraction of the field. We present a field recovery consensus+innovations type distributed algorithm that is resilient to measurement attacks, where an agent maintains and updates a local state based on its neighbors states and its own measurement. Under sufficient conditions on the attacker and the connectivity of the communication network, each agent's state, even those with compromised measurements, converges to the true value of the field components that it is interested in recovering. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our algorithm through numerical examples.",,第3页.xls
602,Interdependence design principles in practice,2022,"Adaptability lies at the heart of effective teams and it is through management of interdependence that teams are able to adapt. This makes interdependence a critical factor of human-machine teams. Nevertheless, engineers building human-machine systems still rely on the same tools and techniques used to build individual behaviors which were never designed to address the complexity that stems from interdependence in joint activity. Many engineering approaches lack any systematic rigor and formal method for identifying, managing and exploiting interdependence, which forces ad hoc solutions or workarounds. This gap between theories of interdependence and operable tooling leaves designers blind to the issues and consequences of failing to adequately address interdependence within human-machine teams. In this article, we propose an approach to operationalizing core concepts needed to address interdependence in support of adaptive teamwork. We describe a formalized structure, joint activity graphs, built on interdependence design principles to capture the essence of joint activity. We describe the runtime requirements needed to dynamically exploit joint activity graphs and to support intelligent coordination during execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such a structure at supporting adaptability using the Capture-the-Flag domain with heterogeneous teams of unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground systems. In this dynamic adversarial domain, we show how agents can make use of the information provided by joint activity graphs to generally and pragmatically react and adapt to perturbations in the joint activity, the environment, or the team and explicitly manage and exploit interdependence to produce effective teamwork. In doing so, we demonstrate how flexible and adaptive teamwork can be achieved through formally guided design that supports effective management of interdependence.",,第3页.xls
603,Adapting the SPMSA (Software Project Management Supported by Software Agents) Model to PMBOK2004 Guidelines,2009,"Numerous software development projects either do not live up to expectations or they fail outright. The scope, environment and implementation of software projects are changing due to globalisation, advances in computing technologies as well as the deployment of software projects in distributed, collaborative and virtual environments. As a result, traditional project management methods fail to address the added complexities found in this everchanging environment. The authors proposed the software project management model, entitled SPMSA (Software Project Management Supported by Software Agents) that aims to enhance software project management by taking the unique nature and changing environment of software projects into account. The SPMSA model supports the entire spectrum of software project management functionality, supporting and enhancing each key function with a team of software agents. In this paper the authors adapt the SPMSA model to incorporate PMBOK2004 guidelines. The SPMSA model makes a fresh contribution to enhance software project management by utilising software agent technology.",,第3页.xls
604,Defining Multi-Party Compromises using Unfoldings of Workflow Nets,2013,"In this paper we develop a negotiation and contracting framework for inter-organisational workflows. The overall aim is to compute a group-plan from a given set of individual plans, where plans are formulated in the context of a given inter-organisational workflow between the agents. A general problem is that the individual plans are not consistent, i.e. the intersection of all individual plans does not contain a complete process, which leads from the initial state of the workflow to its final state. Therefore, negotiation is needed to obtain a compromise. In this paper we develop a generic negotiation protocol and use branching processes as the elementary data structure.The generic protocol is adapted within the specifics of our SONAR-framework. SONAR is a specification framework that defines the organisational structure of multi-agent systems. SONAR has a formal notion of teams and team-formation which is used here to instantiate the strategy parameters.",,第3页.xls
605,Electronic commerce software agents: The featured-based filtering approach,2002,"Software agents can change the nature of interactions on the Internet: from simple access to large databases, to dynamic and personalized information and advice source. This approach becomes more important when product features and attributes are complex and qualitative as well as when the opportunities for differentiation, customization, and tailoring to individual preferences increase. In order to implement a software agent approach as an intelligent recommendation system, these agents have to be intelligent enough to learn their users' criteria and learn how to aggregate information from different mediums and how to help reinforce this information using these mediums. In this paper, we describe several algorithms, which can be appropriate to be the center of such scheme, including supervised learning neural networks and support vector machines.",,第3页.xls
606,ARES 2: A tool for evaluating cooperative and competitive multi-agent systems,2005,"The Agent Rescue Emergency Simulator (ARES) system provides a simplified rescue scenario similar to Robocup Rescue for use in the educational or research fields when evaluating multi-agent systems. The environment within ARES abstracts ideas down to key features while still allowing for a wide range of scenarios requiring different skills to be presented to the agents. This is achieved by combining different features together and changing the configuration of the environmental rules incorporated in ARES. With the simplified environment ARES can be used for quick evaluations of concepts based upon the results from a range of different configurations of the system. The results from these tests can be used as a basis for further experiments when transitioning the work from a theoretical level to more real world scenarios, where the requirement for a more complex system is needed. Our newest version of ARES, ARES 2, allows for scenarios that range from cooperation between all agents to strong competitiveness of agents or even agent teams.",,第3页.xls
607,CMieux: Adaptive strategies for competitive supply chain trading,2009,"Supply chains are a central element of today's global economy. Existing management practices consist primarily of static interactions between established partners. Global competition, shorter product life cycles and the emergence of Internet-mediated business solutions create an incentive for exploring more dynamic supply chain practices. The supply chain trading agent competition (TAC SCM) was designed to explore approaches to dynamic supply chain trading between automated software agents. TAC SCM pits trading agents developed by teams from around the world against one another. Each agent is responsible for running the procurement, planning and bidding operations of a PC assembly company, while competing with others for both customer orders and supplies under varying market conditions. This paper presents Carnegie Mellon University's 2005 TAC SCM entry, the CMieux supply chain trading agent. CMieux implements a novel approach for coordinating supply chain bidding, procurement and planning, with an emphasis on the ability to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions. We present empirical results based on 200 games involving agents entered by 25 different teams during what can be seen as the most competitive phase of the 2005 tournament. Not only did CMieux perform among the top five agents, it significantly outperformed these agents in procurement while matching their bidding performance. We also simulated 40 games against the best publicly available agent binaries. Our results show CMieux has significantly better average overall performance than any of these agents.

608,INCENTIVES AND PERFORMANCE IN LARGE-SCALE LEAN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT An Agent-based Simulation Approach,2011,"The application of lean principles and agile project management techniques in the domain of large-scale software product development has gained tremendous momentum over the last decade. However, a simple transfer of good practices from the automotive industry combined with experiences from agile development on a team level is not possible due to fundamental differences stemming from the particular domain specifics - i.e. different types of products and components (material versus immaterial goods), knowledge work versus production systems as well as established business models. Especially team empowerment and the absence of a a hierarchical control on all levels impacts goal orientation and business optimization. In such settings, the design of adequate incentive schemes in order to align local optimization and opportunistic behavior with the overall strategy of the company is a crucial activity of central importance.Following an agent-based simulation approach with reinforcement learning, we (i) address the question of how information regarding backlog item dependencies is shared within and in between development teams on the product level subject to different incentive schemes. We (ii) compare different incentive schemes ranging from individual to team-based compensation. Based on our results, we are (iii) able to provide recommendations on how to design such incentives, what their effect is, and how to chose an adequate development structure to foster overall software product development flow by means of more economic decisions and thus resulting in a shorter time to market. For calibrating our simulation, we rely on practical experience from a very large software company piloting and implementing lean and agile for about three years.",,第3页.xls
609,Improving Team's Consistency of Understanding in Meetings,2016,"Upon concluding a meeting, participants can occasionally leave with different understandings of what had been discussed. Detecting inconsistencies in understanding is a desired capability for an intelligent system designed to monitor meetings and provide feedback to spur stronger shared understanding. In this paper, we present a computational model for the automatic prediction of consistency among team members' understanding of their group's decisions. The model utilizes dialogue features focused on the dynamics of group decision-making. We trained a hidden Markov model using the AMI meeting corpus and achieved a prediction accuracy of 64.2%, as well as robustness across different meeting phases. We, then, implemented our model in an intelligent system that participated in human team planning about a hypothetical emergency response mission. The system suggested topics that the team would derive the most benefit from reviewing with one another. Through an experiment with 30 participants, we evaluated the utility of such a feedback system and observed a statistically significant increase of 17.5% in objective measures of the teams' understanding compared with that obtained using a baseline interactive system.",,第3页.xls

Agents in these games struggle against the players who learn to adapt to their strategies leading to the players dissatisfaction. We present our work on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to learn a controller of a commander in the AI Sandbox platform, a flexible simulation environment which allows users across the world to participate in a variety of challenges and competitive games. As a result of building an RL controller for a commander we found that performance varies significantly across opponents, maps and team sizes, where the RL controller shows adequate performance in a subset of the games played and struggles in others.",,第3页.xls
611,The supply chain trading agent competition,2005,"Supply chain management deals with the planning and coordination of bidding, production, sourcing and procurement activities associated with one or more products. It is central to today's global economy, leading to trillions of dollars in annual transactions worldwide. With the emergence of electronic marketplaces, it is only natural to seek automated solutions that are capable of rapidly evaluating a large number of bidding, sourcing and procurement options. In this paper, we detail a game we have designed to promote the research and evaluation of such solutions under realistic conditions. The game requires agents to manage the assembly of PCs, while competing with one another both for customer orders and for key components. We discuss how the game captures the complexity, stochasticity and competitive nature inherent to supply chain environments. A Web-based multi-agent simulation platform developed for the game was implemented in 2003 and validated in the context of the first Supply Chain Management Trading Agent Competition (TAC-SCM). A total of 20 teams from around the world competed with one another. We review agent strategies developed by different teams and discuss the merits of competition-based research over more traditional research methodologies in this area. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

612,An Anytime Algorithm for Simultaneous Coalition Structure Generation and Assignment,2018,"A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is how to organize and coordinate agents to improve their performance and skills. In this paper, we consider simultaneously generating coalitions of agents and assigning the coalitions to independent tasks, and present an anytime algorithm for thesimultaneous coalition structure generation and assignmentproblem. This optimization problem has many real-world applications, including forming goal-oriented teams of agents. To evaluate the algorithms performance, we extend established methods for synthetic problem set generation, and benchmark the algorithm againstCPLEXusing randomized data sets of varying distribution and complexity. We also apply the algorithm to solve the problem of assigning agents to regions in a major commercial strategy game, and show that the algorithm can be utilized in game-playing to coordinate smaller sets of agents in real-time.",,第3页.xls
613,Marsupial teams of robots: deployment of miniature robots for swarm exploration under communication constraints,2014,"Mobile Ad hoc Networks have attracted much attention in the last years, since they allow the coordination and cooperation between agents belonging to a multi-robot system. However, initially deploying autonomously a wireless sensor robot network in a real environment has not taken the proper attention. Moreover, maintaining the connectivity between agents in real and complex environments is an arduous task since the strength of the connection between two nodes (i.e., robots) can change rapidly in time or even disappear. This paper compares two autonomous and realistic marsupial strategies for initial deployment in unknown scenarios, in the context of swarm exploration: Random and Extended Spiral of Theodorus. These are based on a hierarchical approach, in which exploring agents, named scouts, are autonomously deployed through explicit cooperation with supporting agents, denoted as rangers. Experimental results with a team of heterogeneous robots are conducted using both real and virtual robots. Results show the effectiveness of the methods, using a performance metric based on dispersion. Conclusions drawn in this work pave the way for a whole series of possible new approaches.",,第3页.xls

The first view is a rather conceptual one, presenting general BDI design principles, namely heuristic options, decomposed reasoning and layered planning, which enable BDI deliberation in realtime domains. The second view is focused on the practical application of the design principles in RoboCup Simulation League. This application not only evaluates the usefulness in deliberation but also the usefulness in rapid cooperative implementation. We compare this new approach, which has been used in the Vice World Champion team AT Humboldt 98, to the old approach of AT Humboldt 97, and we outline our ideas for further improvements, which are still under work.",,第3页.xls

Agents operate for the coordination of multitasks performed within the plant. In particular, we discuss the agents' operation selection problem. The agent's required capabilities requires effective design and implementation approaches able to cope with the high-level demands. In this paper, we provide a cooperative control scheme for a team of flexible manufacturing workcells.

617,The Most Economical Redundant Assignment,2019,"Redundant assignments are a common way to manage team performance. This requirement arises from real-world practices including team management, and highly-available systems. However, it is a complex problem due to limited resources. The lack of available modeling tools makes it even more difficult to provide an accurate solution. Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) and its Environments-Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model are tools well suited to tackle such a problem.This paper formalizes the problem of determining the most economical redundant assignment (MERA) with the E-CARGO model, clarifies it as a multi-objective optimization problem; proposes two solutions: one by using a Linear Programming (LP) solver, i.e., the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Platform (CPLEX); and one by using our previous work on Group Role Assignment (GRA), where the latter solution is much more efficient than the former one. This work contributes an investigation of the MERA problem to state of the art on the subject of assignment. The proposed solution provides technical support for decision making in solving similar problems.",,第3页.xls
618,Dynamic Assignment of Geospatial-Temporal Macro Tasks to Agents under Human Strategic Decisions for Centralized Scheduling in Multi-Agent Systems,2014,"This paper addresses a centralized scheduling problem in multi-agent systems by which the incident commander (I.C.) of a disaster response team aims to coordinate actions of field units (rational agents) in order to minimize the total operation time in uncertain, dynamic, and spatial environments. The purpose of this paper is to propose an intelligent software system that assists the I.C. in dynamic assignment of geospatial-temporal macro tasks to agents under human strategic decisions. This system autonomously executes a heuristic algorithm to minimize the maximum total dependent duration according to human high-level strategies. The result is a schedule composed of macro decisions that each one states seven types of information: 1) what task type is going to be done, 2) who (a subset of agents) are assigned to do this assignment, 3) where (a road segment or zone as a macro geospatial object) contains a subset of tasks, 4) when operations start, 5) when operations finish, 6) how many tasks are estimated to be done, 7) what task types and how many of them are estimated to be revealed in this location after to finish this job. This result, which is a feasible solution for the addressed problem, permits the I.C. to coordinate agents, partially specify activities of agents in time and space, minimize the overall execution time for all tasks, calculate a right time to revise a strategic decision, evaluate the efficiency of a high-level strategy, and estimate the makespan.",,第3页.xls
619,Planning in stochastic domains for multiple agents with individual continuous resource state-spaces,2011,"An approximation method is proposed that solves a class of Decentralized hybrid Markov Decision Processes (DEC-HMDPs). These DEC-HMDPs have both discrete and continuous state variables and represent individual agents with continuous measurable state-spaces, such as resources. Adding to the natural complexity of decentralized problems, continuous state variables lead to a blowup in potential decision points. Representing value functions as Rectangular Piecewise Constant (RPWC) functions, we formalize and detail an extension to the Coverage Set algorithm (CSA) (Becker et al., J Artif Intell Res, 22, 2004) that solves transition independent DEC-HMDPs with controlled error. The resource constraints of each agent lead to problems that are over-subscribed in the number of agents, that is where some agents have no role to play. Based on our extension to the CSA, two heuristics are proposed that allow A*-like search to find the minimal optimal team of agents that is solution to a given problem. We apply and test our algorithms on a range of multi-robot exploration problems with continuous resource constraints.",,第3页.xls
620,Intelligent Peer Networks for Collaborative Web Search,2008,"Collaborative query routing is a new paradigm for web search that treats both established search engines and other publicly available indexes as intelligent peer agents in a search network. The approach makes it transparent for anyone to build his or her own (micro) search engine by integrating established web search services, desktop search, and topical crawling techniques. The challenge in this model is that each of these agents must team about its environment-the existence, knowledge, diversity, reliability and trustworthiness of other agents-by analyzing the queries received from and results exchanged with these other agents. We present the 6S peer network, which uses machine-learning techniques to learn about the changing query environment. We show that simple reinforcement learning algorithms are sufficient to detect and exploit semantic locality in the network, resulting in efficient routing and high-quality search results. A prototype of 6S is available for public use and is intended to assist in the evaluation of different AI techniques employed by the networked agents.",,第3页.xls
621,A team of agents cooperating for intelligent tutoring,1998,"This paper presents how the tutoring knowledge in an ITS, in particular in a domain involving problem-solving skills in addition to conventional domain theory, can be designed and organised as a team of cooperating intelligent agents. After a brief description of the domain knowledge and a generic functioning framework for ITSs in problem-solving domains, we introduce how the tutoring knowledge is modelled as pedagogical agents. We then show how these agents are designed to interact with one another and with the student, and discuss about techniques which may help an agent to decide to intervene in the process in order to fulfil a given pedagogical function, henceforth making pedagogical interactions smoother and hopefully more efficient. To illustrate our point of view, we then present and comment, in a particular application domain, a problem-solving exercise and a possible tutoring dialogue based on that exercise. Finally, referring to that example, we show a few techniques by which such a dialogue can be achieved. Such a cooperative-agent-oriented model should both facilitate the implementation of the tutoring knowledge in an ITS and help improve the student's comprehension through more efficient pedagogical interactions.",,第3页.xls
622,CBR: Fuzzified case retrieval approach for facial expression recognition,2007,"We present a new scheme for the recognition of facial expressions from a set of facial features using fuzzy enhanced Case-based Reasoning (CBR). Facial expression recognition has become the cornerstone of human-computer interaction (HCI) systems. It has wide range applications information systems and e-commerce such as intelligent desktops and intelligent web agents.Our system is the integration of two fundamental paradigms of AI, i.e., Fuzzy logic and Case Based Reasoning. Fuzzy logic is embedded into our CBR system for improved case retrieval. A dual, fuzzy similarity determination module is the core of our system and works within the Case-based Reasoning system. The advantages from Fuzzy Rule Based Systems (FRBS) like linguistic modeling and fault tolerance when combined with the reasoning capability of CBR greatly improved the sophistication and utility of our system. A reinforcing combination of two approaches might lead to exciting applications that are yet to be envisaged.",,第3页.xls

Robots are capable of performing an ever wider range of tasks, and there is an increasing need for solutions to high-level problems such as multi-agent coordination. In this paper we examine the problem of finding a robust exploration strategy for a team of mobile robots that takes into account communication limitations. We propose four performance metrics to evaluate and compare existing multi-robot exploration algorithms, and present a role-based approach in which robots either act as explorers or as relays. The result is a complete exploration of the environment in which information is efficiently returned to a central command centre, which is particularly applicable to the domain of rescue robotics.",,第3页.xls
624,Socially conscious decision-making,2000,"For individually motivated agents to work collaboratively to satisfy shared goals, they must be able to make decisions about actions and intentions in the context of commitments to group activities. This paper examines the role of social consciousness in the process of reconciliation of intentions to do group-related actions with other, conflicting intentions. We define a measure of social consciousness; describe its incorporation into the SPIRE experimental system, a simulation environment that allows the process of intention reconciliation in team contexts to be simulated and studied; and present results of several experiments that investigate the interaction in decision-making of measures of group and individual good. In particular, we investigate the effect of varying levels of social consciousness on the utility of the group and the individuals it comprises.

625,Agents for multidisciplinary design in virtual worlds,2007,"Agent models provide a generalized approach to the design of systems that autonomously monitor and affect an environment. Societies of agents that reason and communicate about an environment can achieve complex emergent behavior to facilitate and augment human activities. This paper introduces artificial agent technologies as a means by which the behavioral complexity of virtual worlds can be extended to provide the functionality needed to support collaboration in multidisciplinary design teams. Three key roles are identified that artificial agents can play to provide this functionality: support for multiple views of designed objects, support for the expression of relationships between designed objects, and compatibility with existing design tools. The implementation of a society of agents fulfilling these roles within a virtual world based. multidisciplinary design tool called DesignWorld is described. The increased behavioral complexity and functionality of DesignWorld's underlying virtual world is demonstrated using the results of multidisciplinary design experiments with DesignWorld.",,第3页.xls
626,Displays for Effective Human-Agent Teaming: The Role of Information Availability and Attention Management,2015,"In military and industrial systems, visual displays form a critical link between humans and agents. Through visual displays, human operators monitor indications of agent status to detect issues and proactively manage emerging problems. As operators manage increasingly more agents, conveying status becomes an especially complex visualization challenge. To effectively manage operator attention and support proactivity, careful consideration must be given to what information to provide access to and how best to assign visual salience to that information. Here, we systematically analyze and empirically evaluate the effectiveness of standard and novel status indicator formats in supporting proactive monitoring of multiple agents. The results reveal shortfalls of standard formats fielded in today's control systems, inadequacies of those formats for future multi-agent monitoring, and benefits of novel formats. For application, we provide guidance for status format design and use, mitigations for improving inadequate formats, and inspiration for creating novel formats for improved monitoring.",,第3页.xls
627,Communication-based multiple mobile robots rigid formation control,2004,"In this paper, we describe a general multiple mobile robots formation control system through communication channel. With this technique, the multirobot formation control system without environment constraint can be realized. A distinguishing feature of our work is the fact that robot formation relies only on communication whether the members in team sense others or not. Firstly, we propose a kind of multirobot formation architecture based on multi-agent system. Furthermore, in this architecture, modularization agent design is taken. To demonstrate the validity of such framework, an improved closed-up multirobot rigid formation control algorithm is introduced. Our results include a series of virtual robot simulations and experiments using three mobile robots. The results show our design is feasible.",,第3页.xls
628,Diagnostic problem solving using swarm intelligence,2005,"Swarm intelligence can be viewed as the emergent collective intelligence of a group of agents, emphasizing direct or indirect local interactions among relatively simple agents. Swarm methods have been widely used for low-dimensional problems such as modeling collective movements in physical space (computer-generated animation, multi-robot teams, etc.), but they have been less studied in higher dimensional problems, mostly in the form of numerical optimization. In this work, we take a step toward applying these kind of systems to diagnostic problem-solving using causal networks. In our model, simple agents move in an abstract high-dimensional space, and based only on local interactions, generate a solution as a result of their collective behavior. Computational experiments show that this model can approximate the best diagnostic solutions (i.e., Bayesian optimal) in reasonably sized problems.",,第3页.xls
629,Multi-agent Simulation of Search and Rescue in Landslide Based on Auction Mechanism,2016,"The research on search and rescue after landslide is very important for improving the victims' survival rate. In this paper, the improved Truncated Levy walks are used to simulate rescue teams' search behaviors. We propose a cooperative rescue plan based on distributed auction mechanism and simulate its effect in three disaster scenarios fatal, serious and normal. The simulation results show that the cooperative rescue plan outperform non-cooperative rescue plan. The robustness analysis shows that search radius plays an important role in improving the rescue efficiency, and the scope of cooperation does not have a significant effect on rescue efficiency. The sensitivity analysis shows that both time limit for rescue operations in one single site and maximum turning angle for next step can impact the rescue efficiency, and there exist optimal value for both of them in consideration of rescue efficiency.",,第3页.xls

631,A Strategical Path Planner for UGV-UAV Cooperation in Mars Terrains,2018,"Mars exploration is an ongoing researching topic mainly due to the technological breakthroughs in robotic platforms. Space agencies as NASA, are considering future Mars explorations where multi-robot teams cooperate to maximize the scientific return. In this regard, we present a cooperative team formed by a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to autonomously perform a Mars exploration. We develop a strategical path planner to compute a route plan for the UGV-UAV team to reach all the target points of the exploration. The key problems that we have considered in Mars explorations for the UGV-UAV team are: the UAV energy constraints and the UGV functionality constraints. Our strategical path planner models the UGV as a moving charging station which will carry the UAV through secure locations close to the target points locations, and the UAV will visit the target points using the UGV as a recharging station. Our solution has been tested in several scenarios and the results demonstrate that our approach is able to carry out a coordinated plan in a local optimal mission time on a real Mars terrain.",,第3页.xls
632,Multiagents systems for virtual environment for training application to fire-fighting,2003,"We are concerned with virtual environments for training in operational conditions. The principal developed idea is that these environments are heterogeneous and open multiagent systems. The MASCARET model is proposed to organize the interactions between agents and to give them reactive, cognitive and social abilities to simulate the physical and social environment. The physical environment represents, in a realistic way, the phenomena that learners and teachers have to take into account. The social environment is simulated by agents executing collaborative and adaptive tasks. They realize, in team, procedures that they have to adapt to the environment. The users participate in the training environment through their avatar. To validate our model, the SECUREVI application for fire-fighters training is developed.",,第3页.xls
633,Experimental Assessment of an Emotion Tracking Software Agent (ETA) for assisting Communicative Interactions of Multitasking Users in Groupware,2011,Interactions such as discussion and negotiation in face-to-face work contexts strongly rely on non-verbal feedback. Such feedback provides indications of important negotiation states such as agreement or disagreement and understanding or confusion. The increasing popularity of groupware and its use by virtual teams for collaborative remote work necessitates the development of appropriate tools to manage the reality of distributed and remote work. Such remote collaboration is often hampered by a lack of social cohesion and such phenomena as participant multi-tasking. This paper outlines the experimental assessment of a proof of concept AI based software agent (Emotion Tracking Agent or ETA) for the real-time tracking of groupware user's facial expressions of emotion during virtual meetings. The software agent is designed as a novel approach to the removal of negative or unwanted effects of user multitasking and attention distracting behaviours in virtual collaboration and meeting environments.,,第3页.xls

The principal agent problem is discussed between the leaders and partners on risk management. The disadvantageous effects on leaders are pointed out for hidden information after contracting. The risk management model of moral hazard with hidden information (DDM) is developed for those virtual enterprises which are in relation non-team and may exploit their information in an opportunistic way.

The communication system of robot team and principle of data exchange are described. Communication protocol is considered. In this system is used ZeroMQ communication programming library. The Publisher/subscriber principle of data exchange is employed in this communication structure. The decentralize algorithm of the tasks distribution between robots is considered.

637,Evaluation of multiagent teams via a new approach for strategy game simulator,2007,"This paper discusses some practical experiments using JaRTS, the Java Real-Time Strategy simulator, which is our proposal of simulator for real-time strategic games. The main goal of this simulator is to support the evaluation of different team approaches, implemented as multiagent systems, during pre-defined game contests. In fact, we show that the use of a simulator is important to evaluate several individual aspects and components of a team design, rather than only the final product as a whole. The experiments were carried out during a student's competition, where we could testify if JaRTS was actually able to detect positive and negative aspects of different Al approaches to Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games.",,第3页.xls
638,Automating short-term insertion of parts for heterogeneous robots using a control basis approach,2011,Robotics technology is quickly evolving and demanding robots to perform more actions and with greater complexity. Modular construction tasks are well suited for heterogenous robots. In this paper we studied if modularizing a distributed multi-agent architecture with a control modular framework was a viable approach to generate complex robotic behavior with short term autonomy. To this end we tasked a heterogeneous robot team to perform an assembly task using force sensing. We also studied which robots would be better suited for a given task. Our experimental results concluded that the modular control approach was viable to generate short- term autonomous complex robotic behavior and our analysis characterized the advantages of each robot for the assembly task.,,第3页.xls
639,Simulating Collective Intelligence of the Communities of Practice Using Agent-Based Methods,2010,"The modern organizations are facing problems which have caused them to lose personnel. Losing people, the organizations lose knowledge. One of the solutions is to collaborate and share knowledge across time and distance. Knowledge sharing in communities has attracted attention in fields like knowledge management or sociology, in both research and practice. Inter-organizational forms of network organizations are more and more accentuated. The paper focuses on the communities of practice within organizations and how through these communities collective intelligence is stimulated. First, we present the concept of communities of practice and show how multi-agent systems can simulate the behavior of complex systems composed of distinct components. Then we highlight the importance of collective intelligence in communities of practice and suggest a way to model communities of practice's dynamics. The main objective of the paper is to simulate collective intelligence capacity using agent-based models, and more specifically, the team of knowledge workers formation.",,第3页.xls
640,An agent-based approach for interleaved composition and execution of web services,2004,"The emerging paradigm of web services promises to bring to distributed computing the same flexibility that the web has brought to the publication and search of information contained in documents. This new paradigm puts severe demands on composition and execution of workflows that must survive and respond to changes in the computing and business environments. Workflows facilitated by web services must, therefore, allow dynamic composition in ways that cannot be predicted in advance. Utilizing the notions of shared mental models and proactive information exchange in agent teamwork research, we propose a solution that interleaves planning and execution in a distributed manner. This paper proposes a generic model, gives the mappings of terminology between Web services and team-based agents, describes a comprehensive architecture for realizing the approach, and demonstrates its usefulness with the help of an example. A key benefit of the approach is the proactive failures handling that may be encountered during execution of complex web services.",,第3页.xls
641,Organization Restrained Negotiation Behavior in CGF,2011,"Due to the uncertainty of battlefield environment, the coherence of organizational behavior is often blocked by the conflicting beliefs among team members. Yet there are few conflicts resolving mechanisms embedded in existing models of CGF. Aiming at human behavior representing (HBR) preciseness requested by combat simulation, a negotiation based conflicts resolving method is presented. Distinct from most existing theories, the negotiation behavior among CGF entities is cooperative. In addition, the communication and decision making behaviors of CGF entities are often restrained by the organization frame. Thus, the organization restrained negotiation behavior is preliminarily analyzed. Finally, a simple example is given. The results show that the method is available and efficient.",,第3页.xls

643,Non-trivial solutions to the n-person prisoners' dilemma,2002,"We have developed an agent-based simulation tool to model social dilemmas for the case of a large number of not necessarily rational decision-makers (Szilagyi and Szilagyi, 2000). The combination of various personalities with stochastic learning makes it possible to simulate the multi-person prisoners' dilemma game for realistic situations. A variety of personality profiles and their arbitrary combinations can be represented, including agents whose probability of cooperation changes by an amount proportional to its reward from the environment. For the case of such agents the game has non-trivial but remarkably regular solutions. We discuss a method and present an algorithm for making accurate advance predictions of these solutions. We also propose our model as a viable approach for the study of populations of cells, organisms, groups, organizations, communities, and societies. It may lead to better understanding of the evolution of cooperation in living organisms, international alliances, sports teams, and large organizations.",,第3页.xls
644,A Dataset Schema for Cooperative Learning from Demonstration in Multi-robots Systems [arXiv],2019,"Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have been used to solve complex problems that demand intelligent agents working together to reach the desired goals. These Agents should effectively synchronize their individual behaviors so that they can act as a team in a coordinated manner to achieve the common goal of the whole system. One of the main issues in MASs is the agents' coordination, being common domain experts observing MASs execution disapprove agents' decisions. Even if the MAS was designed using the best methods and tools for agents' coordination, this difference of decisions between experts and MAS is confirmed. Therefore, this paper proposes a new dataset schema to support learning the coordinated behavior in MASs from demonstration. The results of the proposed solution are validated in a Multi-Robot System (MRS) organizing a collection of new cooperative plans recommendations from the demonstration by domain experts.

645,Task allocation in the RoboCup rescue simulation domain: a short note,2002,"We consider the problem of disaster mitigation in the RoboCup Rescue Simulation Environment to be a task allocation problem where the tasks arrive dynamically and can change in intensity. These tasks can be performed by ambulance teams, fire brigades and police forces with the help of an ambulance center, a fire station and a police office. However the agents don't get automatically notified of the tasks as soon as they arrive and hence it is necessary for the agents to explore the simulated world to discover new tasks and to notify other agents of these. In this paper we focus on the problem of task allocation. We have developed two approaches, a centralized combinatorial auction mechanism demonstrated at Agents-2001 and a distributed method which helped our agents finish third in RoboCup-Rescue 2001. With regard to task discovery, we use a greedy search method to explore the world agents count the number of times they have visited each node, and attempt to visit nodes that have been visited the least number of times.",,第3页.xls
646,An Architecture for Defeasible-Reasoning-Based Cooperative Distributed Planning,2011,"Cooperation plays a fundamental role in distributed planning, in which a team of distributed intelligent agents with diverse preferences, abilities and beliefs must cooperate during the planning process to achieve a set of common goals. This paper presents a MultiAgent Planning and Argumentation (MAPA) architecture based on a multiagent partial order planning paradigm using argumentation for communicating agents. Agents use an argumentation-based defeasible reasoning to support their own beliefs and refute the beliefs of the others according to their knowledge. In MAPA, actions and arguments may be proposed by different agents to enforce some goal, if their conditions are known to apply and arguments are not defeated by other arguments applying. In order to plan for these goals, agents start a stepwise dialogue consisting of exchanges of plan proposals to satisfy this open goal, and they evaluate each plan proposal according to the arguments put forward for or against it. After this, an agreement must be reached in order to select the next plan to be refined.",,第3页.xls
647,Agent-based load balancing on homogeneous minigrids: Macroscopic modeling and characterization,2005,"this paper, we present a macroscopic characterization of agent-based load balancing in homogeneous minigrid environments. The agent-based load balancing is regarded as agent distribution from a macroscopic point of view. We study two quantities on minigrids: the number and size of teams where agents ( tasks) queue. In macroscopic modeling, the load balancing mechanism is characterized using differential equations. We show that the load balancing we concern always converges to a steady state. Furthermore, we show that load balancing with different initial distributions converges to the same steady state gradually. Also, we prove that the steady state becomes an even distribution if and only if agents have complete knowledge about agent teams on minigrids. Utility gains and efficiency are introduced to measure the quality of load balancing. Through numerical simulations, we discuss the utility gains and efficiency of load balancing in different cases and give a series of analysis. In order to maximize the utility gain and the efficiency, we theoretically study the optimization of agents' strategies. Finally, in order to validate our proposed agent-based load balancing mechanism, we develop a computing platform, called Simulation System for Grid Task Distribution (SSGTD). Through experimentation, we note that our experimental results in general confirm our theoretical proofs and numerical simulation results from the proposed equation system. In addition, we find a very interesting phenomenon, that is, agent-based load balancing mechanism is topology-independent.",,第3页.xls
648,Decentralized Bayesian search using approximate dynamic programming methods,2008,"We consider decentralized Bayesian search problems that involve a team of multiple autonomous agents searching for targets on a network of search points operating under the following constraints: 1) interagent communication is limited; 2) the agents do not have the opportunity to agree in advance on how to resolve equivalent, but incompatible strategies; and 3) each agent lacks. the ability to control or predict with certainty the actions of the other agents. We formulate the multiagent search-path-planning problem as. a decentralized optimal control problem and introduce approximate dynamic heuristics that can be implemented in a decentralized fashion. After establishing some analytical properties of the heuristics, we present computational results for a search problem involving two agents on a 5 x 5 grid.",,第3页.xls
649,New Patrolling Strategies with Short-Range Perception,2016,"In a Multi-Agent Patrolling Problem (MAPP), a team of agents must optimize a collective metric by moving through a given environment model. MAPPs have a wide range of applications, like continuous surveillance, floor cleaning, and detecting gas leakage. Many heuristic strategies for MAPPs were proposed in the literature using different techniques. In the k-range strategies, autonomous agents communicate indirectly by reading and writing information in the surrounding nodes that are located up to k edges away from the agent. From these, the 0-range strategies (where agents can only sense its current node) are especially suitable for the design of robust autonomous robots with simple hardware. In this work, we propose a new method to convert 1-range strategies (the most common case) into 0-range strategies. We evaluated the new strategies in simulations comparing them to the original 1-range versions. We also built a real low-cost robot that runs the 0-range strategies.",,第3页.xls
650,Multiple evolution and concurrent engineering design,2002,"In a complex engineering design, multiple engineering design agents are required to work cooperatively in order to design a product. Using a single system to model the problem is not natural and can be difficult, since multiple disciplinary teams in different departments, and multiple companies with different modelling methods and techniques are often involved. Each design agent is only concerned with its design issues, having little or no knowledge about the concerns of other agents. A successful engineering design requires specialist knowledge and original ideas in order to produce a high-quality design. In this paper, we present a framework where agent technology is used to model interactions between design systems. We also introduce a multiple-evolutionary approach with an automated negotiation mechanism to enable agents to exchange design ideas and to reach an agreed optimised solution for a global design problem.",,第3页.xls

This paper describes Arian, a general architecture for advice integration. Advice is injected into the system using the advice model which is a case in a CBR system. The architecture comprises an advice adapter to model incomming advice as cases of a CBR system. The Arian architecture is a 2-layered structure in which a refiner component in the top layer is used to modify agent behaviors. The paper also discusses how trust is modelled to distinguish between multiple sources of advice including humans. Arian, the champion team of RoboCup'02 Rescue Simulation Competitions, as an example of an implemented agent based on this proposed architecture is given to show that the architecture is well suited for advice integration. Test results are provided to show how Arian advice-taking agents change their behavior based on incomming advice.",,第3页.xls
652,An evolutionary approach for strategy learning in RoboCup soccer,2004,"This paper proposes an evolutionary method for acquiring team strategies of RoboCup soccer agents. The action of an agent in a subarea is specified by a set of action rules. The antecedent part of action rules includes the position of the agent and the relation. to the nearest opponent. The consequent part indicates the action the agent has to take when the antecedent part Of the action rule is satisfied. The action of each agent is encoded by a integer string that represents the action rules. A chromosome is the concatenated string of integer strings for all the agents. The main genetic operator in our evolutionary method is mutation where a value of each bit is changed with a prespecified probability. Through computer simulations, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as future research directions.",,第3页.xls
653,Multi-agent differential graphical games: Online adaptive learning solution for synchronization with optimality,2012,"Multi-agent systems arise in several domains of engineering and can be used to solve problems which are difficult for an individual agent to solve. Strategies for team decision problems, including optimal control, N-player games (H-infinity control and non-zero sum), and so on are normally solved for off-line by solving associated matrix equations such as the coupled Riccati equations or coupled Hamilton-Jacobi equations. However, using that approach players cannot change their objectives online in real time without calling for a completely new off-line solution for the new strategies. Therefore, in this paper we bring together cooperative control, reinforcement learning, and game theory to present a multiagent formulation for the online solution of team games. The notion of graphical games is developed for dynamical systems, where the dynamics and performance indices for each node depend only on local neighbor information. It is shown that standard definitions for Nash equilibrium are not sufficient for graphical games and a new definition of Interactive Nash Equilibrium is given. We give a cooperative policy iteration algorithm for graphical games that converges to the best response when the neighbors of each agent do not update their policies, and to the cooperative Nash equilibrium when all agents update their policies simultaneously. This is used to develop methods for online adaptive learning solutions of graphical games in real time along with proofs of stability and convergence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

654,Intelligent Agent Transparency in Human-Agent Teaming for Multi-UxV Management,2016,"Objective: We investigated the effects of level of agent transparency on operator performance, trust, and workload in a context of human-agent teaming for multirobot management.Background: Participants played the role of a heterogeneous unmanned vehicle (UxV) operator and were instructed to complete various missions by giving orders to UxVs through a computer interface. An intelligent agent (IA) assisted the participant by recommending two plansa top recommendation and a secondary recommendationfor every mission.Method: A within-subjects design with three levels of agent transparency was employed in the present experiment. There were eight missions in each of three experimental blocks, grouped by level of transparency. During each experimental block, the IA was incorrect three out of eight times due to external information (e.g., commander's intent and intelligence). Operator performance, trust, workload, and usability data were collected.Results: Results indicate that operator performance, trust, and perceived usability increased as a function of transparency level. Subjective and objective workload data indicate that participants' workload did not increase as a function of transparency. Furthermore, response time did not increase as a function of transparency.Conclusion: Unlike previous research, which showed that increased transparency resulted in increased performance and trust calibration at the cost of greater workload and longer response time, our results support the benefits of transparency for performance effectiveness without additional costs.Application: The current results will facilitate the implementation of IAs in military settings and will provide useful data to the design of heterogeneous UxV teams.",,第3页.xls

Directly using single-agent LQ learning algorithms in such models results in regret which increases polynomially with the number of agents. We propose a new Thompson sampling based learning algorithm which exploits the structure of the system model and show that the expected Bayesian regret of our proposed algorithm for a system with agents of vertical bar M vertical bar different types at time horizon T is (O) over tilde(vertical bar M vertical bar(1.5)root T) irrespective of the total number of agents, where the (O) over tilde notation hides logarithmic factors in T.

In this paper we propose a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles that has to control the trajectories of a group of agents having an internal behavioural logic, such as a group of human beings moving in a shared environment or an animal flocking. The controlling UAVs are assumed to generate a force on the group members, modelled as a repulsive force and representing some sort of fear of the flying robot. To this end, this paper proposes both an effective model for the group of agents, which is inspired by the Social Force Model, and a distributed estimation and control algorithm for the controlling UAVs. By means of simulations, the validity of the modelling and the control parts is shown and promising results are derived.",,第3页.xls
657,"On Diversity, Teaming, and Hierarchical Policies: Observations from the Keepaway Soccer Task",2014,"The 3-versus-2 Keepaway soccer task represents a widely used benchmark appropriate for evaluating approaches to reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary robotics. To date most research on this task has been described in terms of developments to reinforcement learning with function approximation or frameworks for neuro-evolution. This work performs an initial study using a recently proposed algorithm for evolving teams of programs hierarchically using two phases of evolution: one to build a library of candidate meta policies and a second to learn how to deploy the library consistently. Particular attention is paid to diversity maintenance, where this has been demonstrated as a critical component in neuro-evolutionary approaches. A new formulation is proposed for fitness sharing appropriate to the Keepaway task. The resulting policies are observed to benefit from the use of diversity and perform significantly better than previously reported. Moreover, champion individuals evolved and selected under one field size generalize to multiple field sizes without any additional training.",,第3页.xls

660,Lessons from Building a Large-scale Commercial IR-based Chatbot for an Emerging Market,2018,"In this talk, we would like to highlight some interesting challenges faced when trying to build a large-scale commercial IR-based chatbot, Ruuh(1), for an emerging market like India which has unique characterisitcs such as high linguistic and cultural diversity, large section of young population and the second largest mobile market in the world. We set out to build a human-like AI agent which aspires to become the trusted BFF of every Indian youth. To meet this objective, we realized that we need to think beyond the utilitarian notion of merely generating relevant responses and enable the agent to comprehend and meet a wider range of user social needs, like expressing happiness when user's favorite team wins, sharing a cute comment on showing the pictures of the user's pet and so on. The agent should also be well-versed with the informal language of the urban Indian youth which often includes slang and code-mixing across two or more languages. Finally, in order to be their trusted friend, the agent has to communicate with respect without offending their sentiments and emotions. Some of the above objectives pose significant research challenges in the areas of NLP, IR and AI. We intend to take the audience through our journey of how we tackled some of the above challenges while building a large-scale commercial IR-based conversational agent. Our attempts to solve some of the above challenges have also resulted in some interesting research contributions in the form of publications and patents in the above areas. Our chat-bot currently has more than 1M users who have engaged in more than 70M conversations.",,第3页.xls

We introduce our coalition strategy extended from the organisational agent, group, role model by assigning an access mechanism to the groups inspired by fuzzy logic principles.

Elevator systems operate in continuous state spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems. Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility.",,第3页.xls
664,Selecting and combining services using goals: A step towards goal-driven processes,2015,"The problem of service selection and composition is central to the field of Semantic Web Services (SWS). Developing effective selection and composition of services can not only produce dynamic service-based environments, but also help business teams and information system developers to better satisfy their user requirements. We propose a new framework, the objective of which is to go one step further during the business process modeling activity and to help analysts design their models, expressing some steps of a business process in terms of goals instead of directly attaching SOA services. Our work proposes an approach to select and combine services using Intelligent agents and planning techniques, using a goal as a source. With this approach we can produce a solution containing one or more services to reach the given goal. We propose MOSS as a formal language to describe the preconditions and effects of services and the goals of agents, and show how the evaluation mechanism can be used to check the preconditions in a given representation of the world, build the potential effects before the execution, and determine if a service will contribute to the goal of an agent.",,第3页.xls
665,Evolving autonomous agent control in the Xpilot environment,2005,"Interactive combat games are useful as test-beds for learning systems employing evolutionary computation. Of particular value are games that can be modified to accommodate differing levels of complexity. In this paper, we present the use of Xpilot as a learning environment that can be used to evolve primitive reactive behaviors, yet can be complex enough to require combat strategies and team cooperation. In addition, we use this environment with a genetic algorithm to learn the weights for an artificial neural network controller that provides both offensive and defensive reactive control for an autonomous agent.",,第3页.xls
666,Maximum Allowable Loss Probability for Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems Over Random Weighted Lossy Networks,2012,"This note studies the consensus seeking problem for a team of general linear dynamical agents that communicate via a weighted random lossy network. Linear state feedback consensus protocols are applied and both the weights and feedback gain are treated as control parameters in the protocol. It is shown that the weights and the link loss probabilities of a network have non-negligible effects on the consensus seeking ability of multi-agent systems. Firstly, a weight condition characterized by the eigenvalues of the weighted Laplacian matrix is given for systems over ideal communication networks without packet losses. Secondly, based on stochastic stability analysis a maximum allowable loss probability bound is proposed for systems over random lossy networks. As long as the link loss probabilities of the network are less than this bound and the mean topology has spanning trees, there exist linear protocols solving the mean-square consensus problem of the system.",,第3页.xls

Exploring the dynamics of team scoring during tournament seasons from recent years we find evidences of superdiffusion. A mean-field analysis results in a drift velocity equal to that of real data but in a different diffusion coefficient. Along with the analysis of real data we present the results of simulations of soccer tournaments obtained by an agent-based model which successfully describes the final scoring distribution [da Silva et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 184, 661 (2013)]. Such model yields random walks of scores over time with the same anomalous diffusion as observed in real data.",,第3页.xls
668,Cognitive Use of Artifacts: Exploiting Relevant Information Residing in MAS Environments,2009,"Besides using language and direct communication, humans adopt various kind of artifacts as effective means to represent, store and share information, and finally support knowledge-based cooperation in complex work environments. Similarly to the human case, we argue that an analogous concept can be effective also in the context of multi-agent systems (MAS) when cognitive agents are of concern. In particular, we investigate the use of cognitive artifacts, as those computational entities designed to store, process and make available environmental resources which are relevant to achieve goals and coordinate their cooperative and distributed activities. Some of the practical benefits of the artifact-based approach are discussed through an experiment based on CArtAgO and Jason technologies. Effectiveness of different interaction strategies are investigated for teams of goal-oriented agents using different kind of comunication styles.",,第3页.xls
669,SELFISH LEARNING: LEVERAGING THE GREED IN SOCIAL LEARNING,2018,"We introduce a sequential Bayesian binary hypothesis testing problem under social learning, termed selfish learning, where agents work to maximize their individual rewards. In particular, each agent receives a private signal and is aware of decisions made by earlier-acting agents. Beside inferring the underlying hypothesis, agents also decide whether to stop and declare, or pass the inference to the next agent. The employer rewards only correct responses and the reward per worker decreases with the number of employees used for decision making. We characterize decision regions of agents in the infinite and finite horizon. In particular, we show that the decision boundaries in the infinite horizon are the solutions to a Markov Decision Process with discounted costs, and can be solved using value iteration. In the finite horizon, we show that team performance is enhanced upon appropriate incentivization when compared to sequential social learning.",,第3页.xls
670,Tree Decontamination with Temporary Immunity,2008,"Consider a tree network that has been contaminated by a persistent and active virus: when infected, a network site will continuously attempt to spread the virus to all its neighbours. The decontamination problem is that of disinfecting the entire network using a team of mobile antiviral system agents, called cleaners, avoiding any recontamination of decontaminated areas. A cleaner is able to decontaminate any infected node it visits; once the cleaner departs, the decontaminated node is immune for t >= 0 time units to viral attacks from infected neighbours. After the immunity time t is elapsed, re-contamination can occur. The primary research objective is to determine the minimum team size, as well as the solution strategy, that is the protocol that would enable such a minimal team of cleaners to perform the task. The network decontamination problem has been extensively investigated in the literature, and a very large number of studies exist on the subject. However, all the existing work is limited to the special case t = 0. In this paper we examine the tree decontamination problem for any value t >= 0. We determine the minimum team size necessary to disinfect any given tree with immunity time t. Further we show how to compute for all nodes of the tree the minimum team size and implicitly the solution strategy starting from each starting node; these computations use a total of Theta(n) time (serially) or Theta(n) messages (distributively). We then provide a complete structural characterization of the class of trees that can be decontaminated with k agents and immunity time t; we do so by identifying the forbidden subgraphs and analyzing their properties. Finally, we consider generic decontamination algorithms, i.e. protocols that work unchanged in a large class of trees, with little knowledge of their topological structure. We prove that, for each immunity time t >= 0, all trees of height at most It can be decontaminated by a team of k = [2h/t+2] agents whose only knowledge of the tree is the bound h. The proof is constructive.",,第3页.xls
671,Agents at Play: Off-the-shelf Software for Practical Multi-robot Applications,2008,"A practical solution based on multi-agent protocols for the development of real-world multi-robot applications is presented. FIPA standard protocols implemented by the JADE library provide the standard functionality for a number of tasks. Robot behaviors are built upon the Player middle-ware. Such components provide off-the-shelf tools which allow a straightforward implementation of indoor localization and navigation tasks for a team of mobile robots. Such integration combines proven mobile robot algorithms with a distributed infrastructure, and extends the capabilities from a robot alone to a whole team of robots, thus allowing the development of cooperative applications. As a proof of concept, an auction-like goal assignment task is presented: the robot team is given a goal, and each robot proposes an estimated cost for achieving it, then the best proposal is selected. Most of the control flow is automated by the standard interaction protocols. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages of combining both frameworks, for a practical yet sound development of multi-robot applications.",,第3页.xls
672,The agent takes the stage,2009,"The deployment of virtual characters in intermedia performance drives divergent agendas of this research group. From the perspective of performance studies, we examine the effect of computer-based characters as actors and believe explorations of mediated agency can open up new forms of engagement for live productions. From the visualisation point of view, we are interested in how abstraction and animation techniques, based on motion tracking and procedural methods, convey character and warp and extend the gestural repertoire of a human actor. In terms of interactive drama, we are working on stream of consciousness characters: algorithmically recombining text to create a psychological entity with an autonomous inner structure. From an artificial intelligence perspective, we investigate how to design and use intelligent agents as actors. These agendas reflect an odd mix of aesthetic and technical concerns, and rightly so, as they are driven by the different goals of our interdisciplinary team.",,第3页.xls
673,Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning based on experience propagation,2013,"For multi-agent reinforcement learning in Markov games, knowledge extraction and sharing are key research problems. State list extracting means to calculate the optimal shared state path from state trajectories with cycles. A state list extracting algorithm checks cyclic state lists of a current state in the state trajectory, condensing the optimal action set of the current state. By reinforcing the optimal action selected, the action policy of cyclic states is optimized gradually. The state list extracting is repeatedly learned and used as the experience knowledge which is shared by teams. Agents speed up the rate of convergence by experience sharing. Competition games of preys and predators are used for the experiments. The results of experiments prove that the proposed algorithms overcome the lack of experience in the initial stage, speed up learning and improve the performance.",,第3页.xls

It gains high attention both from literature and industry because of the outstanding improvements it brings regarding the audit timeliness. This research reviews the three major types of continuous auditing architecture: EAM, ADM and ABM. This paper proposes a continuous auditing architecture based on multi-agent and web services (CAMAWS). The CAMAWS makes the execution of complex audit procedures easy, which is hard to execute in traditionally continuous auditing architecture. The costs of executing audit procedure also minimize, with specially designed functional modules to help manage the audit evidence, knowledge and detected abnormal behaviors. The CAMAWS shows a promising future of using multi-agent in continuous auditing to simulate the collaborative work of manual audit team.",,第3页.xls
675,Engineering change management and decision-making assistance using software agent,2007,"Engineering change management of mechanical products is a critical task which poses many challenges for industrials. Both the integration of the various tools intervening in the life cycle of a product and the management of the communication between the various multidisciplinary teams working on a product are difficult tasks. The communication between disciplines is currently performed mostly using message exchange. The approval process of an engineering change can be achieved only if experts representing the various disciplines meet and agree on the change, which can require a lot of time. This paper proposes an agent-based approach that ensures the propagation of an engineering change towards the external systems concerned. It also checks if the engineering change proposed for a mechanical product does not create any inconsistency with the constraints from the various disciplines involved. Each discipline is represented by an expert agent. When an inconsistency is discovered, a negotiation process is launched.",,第3页.xls
676,Adaptive mLearning System Using Multi-Agent Technology,2010,"The design of adaptive mobileLearning (mLearning) systems has become a discipline of great importance in educational field. This is mainly due to the increasing impact that a high quality eLearning system has in the success of the learning process. However, the growing variety in interaction devices and techniques has raised great expectations for the designs of both methods and architectures that are able to cope with the heterogeneous aspects in an intelligent manner. There is a need to have methodology for mLearning systems, based on software engineering principles, which assist the system designer in every development steps and provide clear, unambiguous analysis and design guidelines.

677,A comparative study in Java-based development platforms for multi-agent systems,2007,"There are many Java-based platforms designed for building Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, there are few comprehensive evaluations to those platforms to help developer select the appropriate one and to figures out advantages and disadvantages for platform development teams. The study compares three of the current prominent and prevalent MAS platforms (JADE, FIPA-OS and ZEUS) on FIPA specification compliancy, platform maturity and nontechnical concerns in the form of tables. The study then discusses the result acquired from the comparison. The study figure out that JADE is better platform than the other two platforms and it is necessary to adopting XML to alleviate interaction problems of MAS.

678,Teams as boundaries: how intra-team and inter-team brokerage influence network changes in knowledge-seeking networks,2019,"What role does an ego's brokerage locationwithin a team (intra-team) or outside the team (inter-team)play in the evolution of an instrumental knowledge-seeking network in terms of both proximal (i.e., within the team) and distal (i.e., outside the team) tie formation and tie decay? We address this question by drawing on literature about social networks, brokerage, and teams. We use temporally separated data from 302 students embedded in 97 teams to test our hypotheses about the impacts of intra-team and inter-team brokerage on proximal and distal network evolution, specifically on four network changes in knowledge-seeking networks: proximal tie formation, proximal tie decay, distal tie formation, and distal tie decay. We find that these four changes depend on individual network brokerage location even after controlling for personality and task characteristics. Specifically, inter-team brokers change their networks both within and outside their teams, whereas intra-team brokers curtail their network changes. We argue that these opposite effects occur because inter-team brokers have greater autonomy than intra-team brokers. This study adds to the ongoing dialog about network evolution in social network literature and to the conversations about brokerage and its location in the context of team-based work.",,第3页.xls

In addition, it (1) offers functionalities for further developing and benchmarking, and (2) provides metrics that help the analysis of the performance of a team of agents during the disaster. Our simulator is based on software made available by the multi-agent programming contest, which over the years has provided challenging problems to be solved by intelligent agents. We evaluate the performance of our simulator in terms of processing time and memory usage, message exchange, and response time.

In this article, we establish the fundamental requirements for social simulation and demonstrate that the Environments-Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model for role-based collaboration (RBC) and the subsequent group role assignment (GRA) optimization model are highly qualified to meet these requirements. Based on E-CARGO and GRA, we propose a new approach to social simulation and conduct a case study to verify this approach. This case study involves a comparison between collectivism and individualism. The contribution of this work is a novel approach to social simulation using E-CARGO and GRA.

682,Intelligent Agent-Based Organization for Studying the Big Five Personality Traits,2020,"Studying behavior of individuals and teams in an organization is termed organizational behavior (OB) study and has a profound research literature under the area of social sciences. OB can be studied through empirical studies or using agent-based system (ABS). Using computing techniques has an advantage over empirical studies, since humans need not be involved in ABS studies and time can be incorporated into the system to study the evolution of the organization over a period. The recent literature on organization behavior shows research gap in using the Big Five personality traits in ABSs to study and evaluate them. An attempt has been made in this study to create a virtual organization incorporating the personality traits and applying it to a real-world problem. The solution obtained is used as a concrete method for evaluation. The observations are encouraging in modeling an organization using ABS and to gain insight into the individual and organizational evolution.",,第3页.xls
683,Modelization of limb coordination for human action analysis,2006,"This paper analyzes the movements of the human body limbs (hands, feet and head) and center of gravity in order to detect simple actions such as walking, jumping and displacing an object. Correlation between these points is guaranteed by considering them as cooperative agents forming a cooperative team : the whole body. The movements are analyzed at individual level and at team level using a hierarchical structure. We make use of a novel framework for online probabilistic plan recognition in cooperative multiagent systems (the multiagent abstract hidden Markov memory model, M-AHMEM) to modelize the human body and detect the actions performed. Knowledge of the high-level team actions (such as walking) improves the pertinence of our predictions on the low-level individual actions (hand is moving back and forth) and allows us to compensate for missing or erroneous data produced by the feature extraction system. Experiments on real video sequences show the feasibility of the approach.",,第3页.xls

Research on virtual human traits has been lacking in analyzing personality as it relates to individual personality as perceived by users. This study aims to analyze the personality difference perception of Korean virtual human influencers among Instagram users in their 20s and suggest strategies for utilizing personality design.Methods First, respondents were shown a selection of Instagram images and allowed to browse the accounts freely. Second, a bipolar 7-point Likert scale survey based on the Five-Factor Model and Volkel's AI Personality Model was administered to assess personality. Third, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using IBM SPSS to analyze the data from the 99 survey responses. Finally, focus group interviews were conducted.Result Differences in perceptions of the Five-Factor Model's personality were found in all personality factors except for ‘Friendly.' Furthermore, regarding Volkel's AI model, respondents noted personality differences in five out of ten personality traits.

685,Designing for human-agent collectives: display considerations,2017,"The adoption of unmanned systems is growing at a steady rate, with the promise of improved task effectiveness and decreased costs associated with an increasing multitude of operations. The added flexibility that could potentially enable a single operator to control multiple unmanned platforms is thus viewed as a potential game-changer in terms of both cost and effectiveness. The use of advanced technologies that facilitate the control of multiple systems must lie within control frameworks that allow the delegation of authority between the human and the machine(s). Agent-based systems have been used across different domains in order to offer support to human operators, either as a form of decision support offered to the human or to directly carry out behaviours that lead to the achievement of a defined goal. This paper discusses the need for adopting a human-agent interaction paradigm in order to facilitate an effective human-agent partnership. An example of this is discussed, in which a single human operator may supervise and control multiple unmanned platforms within an emergency response scenario.",,第3页.xls
686,Principles and development of a medical multi-agent software,1996,"Medicine is a socioeconomic sector that has encouraged many applications of AI techniques. Telemac is a telemedicine multi-agent commercialized in 1996. It was developed in collaboration with a team of doctor from Toulouse Academic Hospital Center (CHU). The paper describes the specificities of Telemac and the reasons why we chose a multi-agent architecture. We describe the Synergic platform that supports this medical application. To warrant some properties for the developers such as coherence of knowledge and rapidity of treatments, the agents of Synergic are cooperative in accordance with the presented rules. They supervise the acceptance, surrender, refusal and persistence of goals or data, and command spontaneous communication acts. Thus, the agents of Synergic automatically inherit these rules of cooperation. Therefore, the developer's job is highly simplified, as it simply involves attributing to the agent a corpus of beliefs. Following a detailed description of a medical session of Telemac, we position our research in relation to commonly adopted approaches.",,第3页.xls

688,Design and implementation of complex agent model using DFA,2010,"A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) based complex agent was proposed to assist cooperative object detection and tracking of robots team. This agent was improved with the behavior model which calls different modules depending on the state in DFA. To evaluate the available evidence on the efficacy and feasibility of the agent, the path data generated by the original algorithm was compared with the DFA based agent. Furthermore, it was applied to the region based multi-object tracking experiment. The results show that the DFA based agent not only improves the performance of an agent itself in dynamic cooperative object detection and tracking, but also improves the efficiency of group cooperation in the perspective of sociology. This agent is totally independent of action control unit, decision making and environment information, so that it has good portability and extendibility. It can be found that the expected value of error and the sample variant in the improved agent are reduced to be only half of the previous one's. It is proved that the improved agent can provide an effective approach to cooperative object detecting and tracking.",,第3页.xls

691,AN ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM FOR OPTIMIZING SEMI-PARAMETRIC SPATIAL AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,2011,"Classical spatial autoregressive models share the same weakness as the classical linear regression models, namely it is not possible to estimate non-linear relationships between the de pendent and independent variables. In the case of classical linear regression a semi-parametric approach can be used to address this issue. Therefore we propose an advanced semi-parametric modelling approach for spatial autoregressive models. Advanced semi-parametric modelling requires determining the best configuration of independent variable vectors, number of spline-knots and the it positions. To solve this combinatorial optimization problem we proposean a synchronous multi-agent system based on genetic-algorithms.

Its main intention is to provide a decision support team with a tool for automatic design of social threat detection systems for public crowded places. Containing a number of distributed detectors, this system performs detection and an identification of threat carriers. The generic model of detector used in the framework allows to consider detection of various types of threats, e.g. infections, explosives, drugs, radiation. The underlying agent-based models provide data on social mobility, which is used along with a probability based quality assessment model within the optimization process. The implemented multi-criteria optimization scheme is based on a genetic algorithm.

693,HOW TO MEET ASYNCHRONOUSLY AT POLYNOMIAL COST,2015,"Two mobile agents starting at different nodes of an unknown network have to meet. This task is known in the literature as rendezvous. Each agent has a different label which is a positive integer known to it but unknown to the other agent. Agents move in an asynchronous way: the speed of agents may vary and is controlled by an adversary. The cost of a rendezvous algorithm is the total number of edge traversals by both agents until their meeting. The only previous deterministic algorithm solving this problem has cost exponential in the size of the graph and in the larger label. In this paper we present a deterministic rendezvous algorithm with cost polynomial in the size of the graph and in the length of the smaller label. Hence, we decrease the cost exponentially in the size of the graph and doubly exponentially in the labels of agents. As an application of our rendezvous algorithm we solve several fundamental problems involving teams of unknown size larger than 1 of labeled agents moving asynchronously in unknown networks. Among them are the following problems: team size, in which every agent has to find the total number of agents; leader election, in which all agents have to output the label of a single agent; perfect renaming, in which all agents have to adopt new and different labels from the set {1, ... , k}, where k is the number of agents; and gossiping, in which each agent has initially a piece of information (value) and all agents have to output all the values. Using our rendezvous algorithm, we solve all of these problems at cost polynomial in the size of the graph and in the smallest length of all labels of participating agents.",,第3页.xls
694,Developing evolutionary neural controllers for teams of mobile robots playing a complex game,2003,"This research develops methods of automating the production of behavioral robotics controllers. Population-based artificial evolution was employed to train neural network-based controllers to play a robotic version of the team game Capture the Flag. The robot agents used processed video data for sensing their environment. To accommodate the 35 to 150 sensor inputs required, large neural networks of arbitrary connectivity and structure were evolved. An intra-population competitive genetic algorithm was used and selection at each generation was based on whether the different controllers won or lost games over the course of a tournament. This paper focuses on the evolutionary neural controller architecture. Evolved controllers were tested in a series of competitive games and transferred to real robots for physical verification.",,第3页.xls
695,Designing for Emergent Security in Heterogeneous Human-Machine teams,2019,"This work seeks to design decisionmaking rules for autonomous agents to jointly influence and optimize the behavior of teamed human decisionmakers in the presence of an adversary. We study a situation in which computational jobs are scheduled on servers by a collection of autonomous machines in concert with self-interested human decisionmakers, and the human and machine schedulers must react to an adversary's attack on one of the servers. We show a simple machine scheduling policy such that if all schedulers have permission to schedule jobs on all servers, increasing the penetration of machine schedulers always increases the level of security in the system, even when the machine schedulers have no explicit coordination or communication amongst themselves. However, we show a companion result in which simple constraints on server availability can nullify the machine schedulers' ability to effectively influence human schedulers; here, even if machine schedulers control an overwhelming majority of jobs, are socially-aware, and fully coordinated amongst themselves, they are incapable of influencing human decisionmakers to mitigate the harm of an attack.",,第3页.xls
696,Collaborative virtual training with physical and communicative autonomous agents,2014,"Virtual agents are a real asset in collaborative virtual environment for training (CVET) as they can replace missing team members. Collaboration between such agents and users, however, is generally limited. We present here a whole integrated model of CVET focusing on the abstraction of the real or virtual nature of the actor to define a homogenous collaboration model. First, we define a new collaborative model of interaction. This model notably allows to abstract the real or virtual nature of a teammate. Moreover, we propose a new role exchange approach so that actors can swap their roles during training. The model also permits the use of physically based objects and characters animation to increase the realism of the world. Second, we design a new communicative agent model, which aims at improving collaboration with other actors using dialog to coordinate their actions and to share their knowledge. Finally, we evaluated the proposed model to estimate the resulting benefits for the users and we show that this is integrated in existing CVET applications.

697,Learning the sequential coordinated behavior of teams from observations,2003,"The area of agent modeling deals with the task of observing other agents and modeling their behavior, in order to predict their future behavior, coordinate with them, assist them, or counter their actions. Typically, agent modeling techniques assume the availability of a plan- or behavior-library, which encodes the full repertoire of expected observed behavior. However, recent applications areas of agent modeling raise challenges to the assumption of such a library, as agent modeling systems are increasingly used in open and/or adversarial settings, where the behavioral repertoire of the observed agents is unknown at design time. This paper focuses on the challenge of the unsupervised autonomous learning of the sequential behaviors of agents, from observations of their behavior. The techniques we present translate observations of the dynamic, complex, continuous multi-variate world state into a time-series of recognized atomic behaviors. This time-series is then analyzed to find repeating subsequences characterizing each team. We compare two alternative approaches to extracting such characteristic sequences, based on frequency counts and statistical dependencies. Our results indicate that both techniques are able to extract meaningful sequences, and do significantly better than random predictions. However, the statistical dependency approach is able to correctly reject sequences that are frequent, but are due to random co-occurrence of behaviors, rather than to a true sequential dependency between them.",,第3页.xls

A black hole destroys all mobile agents visiting that node without leaving any trace. Unlike most previous research on the black hole search problem which employed a colocated team of agents, we consider the more challenging scenario when the agents are identical and initially scattered within the network. Moreover, we solve the problem with agents that have constant-sized memory and carry a constant number of identical tokens, which can be placed at nodes of the network. In contrast, the only known solutions for the case of scattered agents searching for a black hole, use stronger models where the agents have non-constant memory, can write messages in whiteboards located at nodes or are allowed to mark both the edges and nodes of the network with tokens.We are interested in the minimum resources (number of agents and tokens) necessary for locating all links incident to the black hole. In fact, we provide matching lower and upper bounds for the number of agents and the number of tokens required for deterministic solutions to the black hole search problem, in oriented or unoriented rings, using movable or unmovable tokens.",,第3页.xls
699,Goals are Enough: Inducing AdHoc cooperation among unseen Multi-Agent systems in IMFs [arXiv],2024,"Intent-based management will play a critical role in achieving customers' expectations in the next-generation mobile networks. Traditional methods cannot perform efficient resource management since they tend to handle each expectation independently. Existing approaches, e.g., based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) allocate resources in an efficient fashion when there are conflicting expectations on the network slice. However, in reality, systems are often far more complex to be addressed by a standalone MARL formulation. Often there exists a hierarchical structure of intent fulfilment where multiple pre-trained, self-interested agents may need to be further orchestrated by a supervisor or controller agent. Such agents may arrive in the system adhoc, which then needs to be orchestrated along with other available agents. Retraining the whole system every time is often infeasible given the associated time and cost. Given the challenges, such adhoc coordination of pre-trained systems could be achieved through an intelligent supervisor agent which incentivizes pre-trained RL/MARL agents through sets of dynamic contracts (goals or bonuses) and encourages them to act as a cohesive unit towards fulfilling a global expectation. Some approaches use a rule-based supervisor agent and deploy the hierarchical constituent agents sequentially, based on human-coded rules. In the current work, we propose a framework whereby pre-trained agents can be orchestrated in parallel leveraging an AI-based supervisor agent. For this, we propose to use Adhoc-Teaming approaches which assign optimal goals to the MARL agents and incentivize them to exhibit certain desired behaviours. Results on the network emulator show that the proposed approach results in faster and improved fulfilment of expectations when compared to rule-based approaches and even generalizes to changes in environments.",,第3页.xls
700,Anthropomorphism in social robotics: empirical results on human-robot interaction in hybrid production workplaces,2018,"New forms of artificial intelligence on the one hand and the ubiquitous networking of everything with everything on the other hand characterize the fourth industrial revolution. This results in a changed understanding of human-machine interaction, in new models for production, in which man and machine together with virtual agents form hybrid teams. The empirical study Socializing with robots aims to gain insight especially into conditions of development and processes of hybrid human-machine teams. In the experiment, human-robot actions and interactions were closely observed in a virtual environment. Robots as partners differed in shape and behavior (reliable or faulty). Participants were instructed to achieve an objective that could only be achieved via close teamwork. This paper unites different aspects from core disciplines of social robotics and psychology contributing to anthropomorphization with the empirical insights of the experiment. It focuses on the psychological effects (e.g. reactions of different personality types) on anthropomorphization and mechanization, taking the inter- and transdisciplinary field of social robotics as a starting point.",,第3页.xls

We evaluate the behavioral dimensions in a multi-agent predator-prey pursuit task where predator agent coordination necessarily exists due to a shared goal. We explore two conditions, one that is void of explicit coordination (fixedstrategy), and one that has the potential for explicit coordination (learning agents). This comprehensive evaluation of multi-agent behavioral dimensions provides theoretical evidence for true inter-agent coordination by a learning algorithm and the behavioral dimensions that agents coordinate in a cooperative task.",,第3页.xls
703,A Typology of Non-functional Information,2020,"This study takes the interaction between human beings and intelligent systems from a rather basic perspective, that of the exchanged information. Interactions with artificial intelligence (AI) systems is usually studied from the perspective of the fact that they provide information that is apt to the task at hand, that is operational in the sense that it supports the undergoing activity. The practice of the interaction is rather different in that information may result ambiguous, difficult to understand, or completely irrelevant. This paper proposes a typology of non-functional information, by classifying it in: (a)dysfunctional, that is information that is detrimental to the task at hand; (b)pseudo-functional, that is seemingly useful but its use is unclear; and (c)irrelevantinformation, that is of no use. These three categories are confronted with information that is perceived and is actually functional, i.e. useful for the goal it is supposed to serve. In an attempt to explore the workings of these information types, I use a systemic e-cognition (SEC) approach. This allows to change the discourse on information such that it becomes tied to the cognitive interactive system rather than objectively and neutrally defined. The proposed typology is then put to the test by using an agent-based computational simulation model (ABM) where teams gather information from toolsintended as AI systemsas to perform a task. Results show that all the three types of information are related to task performance. This is somehow surprising given that non-functional information has been traditionally discarded as non-existent to the task at hand. Instead, the simulation shows that, from an organizational or systemic perspective, even non-functionally-related interactions serve to prepare the tool to further interaction and eventual performance.",,第3页.xls

705,A framework for implementing self-organising task-oriented multi-sensor networks,1998,"Advanced manipulation skills that enable cooperating robots in a work cell to recognise, handle and assemble arbitrarily placed objects require sensory information on both the environment and assembly process. Using standard approaches it becomes difficult to coordinate sensor usage and data fusion under a given task when the number of sensors becomes large or is changed during run-time. We present a solution to both coordination and fusion based on the multi (sensor) agent paradigm: each agent implements a sensory skill, a negotiation protocol and a physical communication interface to all other agents. Within this sensor-network teams cooperate on a common task. They are formed dynamically after a negotiation phase following a specific task formulation. Our framework consists of a formal specification of the requirements that the sensory skill of an agent has to meet and a comprehensive library of (C++)-objects encapsulating all of the negotiation protocol and communications. This separation makes it very easy to implement individual sensory skills. We show how the abstract concepts of this approach and the metaphor of negotiation work in a real-world network: several uncalibrated cameras are used to guide a manipulator towards a target. We also show how agent-teams may easily (self-)reconfigure during task execution in the case of unexpected events. The framework is distributed free of charge and can be obtained over the Internet at http://magic.uni-bielefeld.de.",,第3页.xls
706,Designing a Conversational Agent for Sexual Assault Survivors: Defining Burden of Self-Disclosure and Envisioning Survivor-Centered Solutions,2021,"Sexual assault survivors hesitate to disclose their stories to others and even avoid case-reporting because of psychological, social, and cultural reasons. Thus, conversational agents (CAs) have gained much attention as a potential counselor because CAs' characteristics (e.g., anonymity) could mitigate various difficulties of human-human interaction (HHI). Despite the potentials, it is difficult to design a CA for survivors because various aspects should be considered. Especially, with traditional HCI approaches only (e.g., need-finding and usability tests), designers could easily miss psychological and subjective burdens that survivors feel toward a new system. Hence, while envisioning a burden-free CA for survivors, we agilely designed and implemented an initial prototype CA (NamuBot) with professionals (the police and counselors). We then conducted a qualitative user study to identify and compare burdens caused by the CA vs. humans. Lastly, we codesigned design features that could reduce the CA-bound burdens with 36 participants (19 survivors and 17 professionals). Notably, our findings showed that 17 survivors preferred reporting their case to NamuBot over humans, expressing far less burden. Although CAs could also place burdens on survivors, the burdens could be alleviated by the features that the survivors and professionals designed. Finally, we present design implications and strategies to develop burden-mitigating CAs for survivors.",,第3页.xls
707,Argonauts: a working system for motivated cooperative agents,2011,"This paper presents the Argonauts multi-agent framework which was developed as part of a one year student project at Technische Universitat Dortmund. The Argonauts framework builds on a BDI approach to model rational agents that act cooperatively in a dynamic and indeterministically changing environment. However, our agent model extends the traditional BDI approach in several aspects, most notably by incorporating motivation into the agent's goal selection mechanism. The framework has been applied by the Argonauts team in the 2010 version of the annual multi-agent programming contest organized by Technische Universitat Clausthal. In this paper, we present a high-level specification and analysis of the actual system used for solving the given scenario. We do this by applying the GAIA methodology, a high-level and iterative approach to model communication and roles in multi-agent scenarios. We further describe the technical details and insights gained during our participation in the multi-agent programming contest.",,第3页.xls

The improvement can be gained if each agent detects the expert agents and use their knowledge properly. In this paper, a new cooperative learning method, called Weighted Strategy Sharing (WSS) is introduced. Also some criteria are introduced to measure the expertness of agents. In WSS, based on the amount of its teammate expertness, each agent assigns a weight to their knowledge. These weights are used in sharing knowledge among agents in our system. WSS and the expertness criteria are tested on two simulated Hunter-Prey problem and Object Pushing systems.",,第3页.xls
709,The Application of Hybrid Distributed Reinforcement Learning Algorithm in RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation System,2008,"The RobuCup 2D Soccer Simulation has been used as the basis for successful international competitions and research challenges. When developing a soccer team for simulated soccer,one has to deal with the RoboCup soccer simulator. In this simulation system, it is the Multiagents' sensory perceptions and individual abilities which are received from the server, coupled with the cooperation strategies designed by researchers, that together determine whether the soccer team will win this game or not. In cooperation strategy designing, researchers often employ the method of Distributed Reinforcement Learning algorithms to optimize the simulation system. The paper is extended as follows: First, we will make a description of the characteristics about the RoboCup simulation system. Second, there is an analysis of the limitation about the traditonal application of Distributed Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, and a new solution will be advanced.

Based either on cartoon drawings, recorded video images of persons, or 3D body models, presentation agents enrich the repertoire of available presentation styles which can be used to effectively communicate information to the user. In this paper, we investigate a new style for presenting information. We introduce the notion of presentation teams which - rather than addressing the user directly - convey information in the style of performances to be observed by him or her. The paper presents an approach to the automated generation of performances which has been tested in two different application scenarios: car sales dialogues and soccer commentary.

711,Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for Multi-Agent Intelligence,2020,"Learning agents that are not only capable of taking tests, but also innovating is becoming a hot topic in AI. One of the most promising paths towards this vision is multi-agent learning, where agents act as the environment for each other, and improving each agent means proposing new problems for others. However, existing evaluation platforms are either not compatible with multi-agent settings. or limited to a specific game. That is, there is not yet a general evaluation platform for research on multi-agent intelligence. To this end, we introduce Arena, a general evaluation platform for multi-agent intelligence with 35 games of diverse logics and representations. Furthermore, multi-agent intelligence is still at the stage where many problems remain unexplored. Therefore, we provide a building toolkit for researchers to easily invent and build novel multi-agent problems from the provided game set based on a GUI-configurable social tree and five basic multi-agent reward schemes. Finally, we provide Python implementations of five state-of-the-art deep multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines. Along with the baseline implementations, we release a set of 100 best agents/teams that we can train with different training schemes for each game, as the base for evaluating agents with population performance. As such, the research community can perform comparisons under a stable and uniform standard. All the implementations and accompanied tutorials have been open-sourced for the community at https://sites.google.com/view/arena-unity/.",,第3页.xls
712,Contracting with self-esteem concerns,2012,"It is widely accepted in social psychology that the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem is a fundamental human motive. We incorporate this factor into an otherwise ordinary principal-agent framework and examine its impact on the optimal incentive scheme and the agent's behavior, especially focusing on the form of intrapersonal strategy known as self-handicapping. Incorporating self-esteem concerns into a contracting situation yields an implication that runs counter to conventional wisdom; that is, the standard tradeoff between risk and incentives may break down (i.e., more uncertainty reduces agency cost and hence results in stronger incentives) in the presence of self-esteem concerns. This is because uncertainty mitigates the need for self-handicapping. This result provides a possible reason for why we do not empirically observe this tradeoff in a robust manner. We present an intuitive condition for this anomaly to arise and provide a set of testable implications. The present framework also reveals why and how team production can be made more profitable, which provides an explanation for the increasing popularity of team production. Finally, this simple logic is applied to identify additional implications for the hidden costs of external enforcers, such as evaluation and monitoring, which are discussed extensively in social psychology.

713,Multi-Robot Dynamic Role Assignment Based on Path Cost,2011,"Robot soccer is one such task and it provides a unique challenge for multi-robot research. Robot soccer teams consist of a number of robots each performing a different role within the team. The roles discussed in this paper are: goalie, defender, special defender, center, supporter and attacker. These roles are two often statically assigned to the robots at the start of the game. Techniques based on path cost can be used to assign these roles dynamically to allow the team to adopt the optimal behavior for each situation. A strategy can be chosen based on robot and ball location which in turn determines which roles should be used in play. Once the roles are defined, they will be assigned to the best robot for each role in turn based on role importance. The approach has been successfully developed for Strive3D, our team for the RoboCup 3D-simulation league which changed to 6 VS 6 from 3 VS 3 in 2010. This paper presents the role assignment based on path cost employed and the favorable results obtained.",,第3页.xls

Each agent is of uncertain dynamics and is affected by other gents in its neighborhood. An agent is able to sense the outputs of the agents inside its neighborhood but is unable o sense those outside its neighborhood. Among all the agents, here is a hidden leader, which knows the desired tracking rajectory, but it is affected by and can only affect those agents inside its neighborhood while all other agents are not aware of for leadership. The decentralized adaptive control is designed or each agent by using the information of its neighbors. Under the proposed decentralized adaptive controls, both rigid mathematical proof and simulation studies are provided to show hat all the agents are guaranteed to reach their common goal, e., following the desired reference.",,第3页.xls
715,A fault-tolerant approach to robot teams,2013,"As the applications of mobile robotics evolve it has become increasingly less practical for researchers to design custom hardware and control systems for each problem. This paper presents a new approach to control system design in order to look beyond end-of-lifecycle performance, and consider control system structure, flexibility, and extensibility. Towards these ends the Control ad libitum philosophy was proposed, stating that to make significant progress in the real-world application of mobile robot teams the control system must be structured such that teams can be formed in real-time from diverse components. The Control ad libitum philosophy was applied to the design of the HAA (Host, Avatar, Agent) architecture: a modular hierarchical framework built with provably correct distributed algorithms. A control system for mapping, exploration, and foraging was developed using the HAA architecture and evaluated in three experiments. First, the basic functionality of the HAA architecture was studied, specifically the ability to: (a) dynamically form the control system, (b) dynamically form the robot team, (c) dynamically form the processing network, and (d) handle heterogeneous teams and allocate robots between tasks based on their capabilities. Secondly, the control system was tested with different rates of software failure and was able to successfully complete its tasks even when each module was set to fail every 0.5-1.5 min. Thirdly, the control system was subjected to concurrent software and hardware failures, and was still able to complete a foraging task in a 216 m(2) environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

716,"Obstacle Detection, Identification and Sharing on a Robotic Soccer Team",2009,"When building a representation of the environment for a robot in a multi-agent application, as is the case of robotic soccer, sensor and information fusion of several elements of the environment are an important task. To build an increasingly better world model, one of the aspects that one should consider is the treatment of obstacles. This paper gives an insight of the general steps necessary for a good obstacle representation in the robot world model. A first step is the visual detection of the obstacles in the image acquired by the robot. This is done using an algorithm based on radial search lines and colour-based blobs detection, where each obstacle is identified and delimited. After having the visually detected obstacles, a fusion with a-priori known information about the obstacles characteristics allows the obstacle separation and filtering, so that obstacles that don't fill the criteria are discarded. With the position information shared by team mates, the matching of the obstacles and the team mates positions is also possible, thus identifying each of them. Finally, and with the purpose of having a team world model as coherent as possible, the robots are able to share the obstacle information of each other. The work presented in this paper was developed for the CAM BADA robotic soccer team. After achieving the 1st place in the Portuguese robotics open Robotica2008 and in the Robocup2008 world championship, the correct treatment of obstacles was one of the new challenges proposed among the team to improve the performance for the next competitions.",,第3页.xls

In combination with increased options for intervention, the need for related communication and coordination support increases. System allows a suitable management in combination with skilled and experienced human operators, a flexible and situative reaction leading to a suitable guidance of reaction forces as well as of groups of human etc.This contribution focusses on the underlying network structuring of related communication and coordination, to support human operators decision quality, to increase the human operator's team situation awareness as well as the overall system's reliability with respect to the overall system's performance.Within this paper different human interaction roles and qualities are discussed, realized by a cooperative teamwork and related devices. The analysis of the performance of the cooperative interacting team members in combination with technical systems as well as knowledge bases or automatically generated information has become an important focus of research in recent years. The proposed approach can be used to model the related behaviors and therefore to analyze the interaction options. This developed approach is based on the Situation-Operator-Modeling (SOM) approach. This approach allows a formalization of complex situations as well as the integration of different agent views within one central perspective. The contribution introduces theoretically to the approach with respect to a shared mental situation awareness. Possible functionalities of SOM-based agent supervision and assistance is introduced using a small emergency management example illustrating teamwork coordination, cognitive supervising, and also automatic detection of decision errors.",,第3页.xls

720,Multiagent Allocation of Markov Decision Process Tasks,2013,"Producing task assignments for multiagent teams often leads to an exponential growth in the decision space as the number of agents and objectives increases. One approach to finding a task assignment is to model the agents and the environment as a single Markov decision process, and solve the planning problem using standard MDP techniques. However, both exact and approximate MDP solvers in this environment struggle to produce assignments even for problems involving few agents and objectives. Conversely, problem formulations based upon mathematical programming typically scale well with the problem size at the expense of requiring comparatively simple agent and task models. This paper combines these two formulations by modeling task and agent dynamics using MDPs, and then using optimization techniques to solve the combinatorial problem of assigning tasks to agents. The computational complexity of the resulting algorithm is polynomial in the number of tasks and is constant in the number of agents. Simulation results are provided which highlight the performance of the algorithm in a grid world mobile target surveillance scenario, while demonstrating that these techniques can be extended to even larger tasking domains.",,第3页.xls

723,Decision as choice of potential intentions,2014,"Multi-agent systems research has been drawing innovative insights from other disciplines such as philosophy and cognitive science. While cognitive studies have shown that over 95% of human decisions conform to the recognition-primed decision making (RPD) model, there still lacks formal descriptions of RPD from agent perspective. The objective of this study is to establish a formal connection between agent mental attitudes and the meta-cognition concepts as used in RPD. We adopt the intentional attitudes as introduced in the SharedPlans theory to model the RPD process and its cognitive activities. In particular, situation recognition is framed as the formation of potential intentions, mental simulation and expectancy monitoring are modeled as two processes for intention evolution, and recognition diagnosis is linked to the notion of intention reconsideration. Such a mentalistic modeling of recognition suggests that the RPD process offers an ideal framework that can systematically integrate intention formation, intention evaluation, and intention reconsiderationthree key activities that BDI agents typically implement. This study also indicates that agent-based modeling is a viable approach for formally studying meta-cognition concepts and team cognition concepts.",,第3页.xls

It needs several related design teams to form a dynamic alliance and collaborate with each other to finish the task. So how to make a good notation about the task and collaborative relationships among the cooperators is becoming a key issue. It is a very important phase in the whole product collaborative designing process, named as early requirements. This paper proposes a goal and agent oriented approach (i* framework) to analyze and model early requirements of product collaborative design.

Based on this goal and agent oriented approach, agent-oriented software architecture for the complex system can be modeled.",,第3页.xls
727,"Understanding theoretical human information interaction, the development of a standard model using an agent based modeling framework",2018,"Human-Agent teaming requires a fundamental understanding of humans' interaction with information. The current dynamics of Human Information Interaction (HIT) are not fully understood or formalized. The dynamics of current and increasingly, future operations will mandate seamless coupling of humans and automated capabilities. Faster decision making and asymmetric views will critically depend on the performance of these human-agent teams. There are various interactions within the HII field of study including how and why humans find, consume, and use information in order to solve problems, make decisions, and carry out other tasks. There are several parallel between HII and biological interactions; one is the concept of energy. No matter the interaction, energy is acquired and expended. We will focus on one interaction, information consumption. The parallel in biology is consumption to the cellular rate of free energy from the Laws of Thermodynamics in a system at chemical equilibrium. Gibbs Standard Free Energy (Delta G degrees = - RT ln K) represents the maximum amount of work obtained from a process under conditions of fixed temperature and pressure. This equation can represent the idea of level of work within HII. We mapped variables in the equation to concepts within HII, for example the equilibrium constant (K) links to the balance of information units before and after interaction task. For this research, we are developing an Agent Based Model where complex interaction can be constructed and evaluated. We are using Netlogo, an integrated environment for model development, visualization, and analysis as a tool for developing this model. In this paper, we will present details of the current implementation of our model with the Gibbs Standard Free Energy equation and initial results from the Netlogo simulations of our model.",,第3页.xls

730,Multi-Robot Coordination Through Mobile Agent,2018,"Robots can protect humans from risk in many applications, such as search and rescue, outer-space exploration, and toxic cleanup. Multi-robot systems have a huge potential to benefit versatile applications through reconfiguring heterogeneous or homogeneous robots in different ways. This paper presents the design and implementation of RoboCoop, a mobile agent-based framework for automatic coordination of multi-robot systems. RoboCoop consists of several modules, such as knowledge base, Input/Output, task procession/execution, and-sensor reading. The agent-based framework utilizes the innate advantages of themulti-threading of each agent, such that each module can run persistently without blocking others. Modules can exchange information and data through inter-agent communication based on the standards of the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA). The presented framework allows robots to coordinate, manage, and execute tasks automatically. Also, a backup mechanism is developed to ensure the robustness of robot systems. Moreover, it allows customized algorithms and strategies for task allocation, and execution. A box-pushing mission has been studied to validate the performance of the proposed cooperation framework in several folds, such as task allocation, path planning and motion synchronization. In this validation, boxes need to be assigned to a two-robot team for them to push to a designated position. The A* path planning algorithm is used for robots to drive to the box location. While the robot can push small boxes independently, the big boxes require two robots pushing simultaneously such that the box can move straight to the location.",,第3页.xls
731,The reference ontology of collective behavior of autonomous agents and its extensions,2015,"A behavioral paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) systems is considered. In this paradigm, it is assumed that the system's intelligence emerges as a result of the individual behaviors and interaction of a set of distributed entities (robots, software agents, and the like) between themselves and with the external environment. An outline of the state of art in the field of behavioral models of artificial intelligence systems is given and, for such models, a unified semantically interpreted behavioral metamodel in the form of a domain-independent reference ontology and its extensions for two particular practically important classes of applications are proposed. The first class of applications deals with the team work of underwater robots autonomously inspecting underwater space in order to ensure its security. The second one corresponds to self-organizing systems composed of a large number of small satellites that autonomously communicate, observe, and inspect outer space. Directions of future research in the field of behavioral models of the distributed entities that cooperatively accomplish an autonomous mission are outlined.",,第3页.xls
732,"HER2 status predicts for upfront AI benefit: A TRANS-AIOG meta-analysis of 12,129 patients from ATAC, BIG 1-98 and TEAM with centrally determined HER2",2017,"Background: A meta-analysis of the effects of HER2 status, specifically within the first 2-3 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, has the potential to inform patient selection for upfront aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy or switching strategy tamoxifen followed by AI. The pre-existing standardisation of methodology for HER2 (immunohistochemistry/fluorescence in situ hybridization) facilitates analysis of existing data for this key marker.Methods: Following a prospectively designed statistical analysis plan, patient data from 3 phase III trials Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination Trial (ATAC), Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 and Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre Trial (TEAM)] comparing an AI to tamoxifen during the first 2-3 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment were collected and a treatment-by-marker analysis of distant recurrence-free interval-censored at 2 -3 years treatment - for HER2 status x AI versus tamoxifen treatment was performed to address the clinical question relating to efficacy of 'upfront' versus 'switch' strategies for AIs.Results: A prospectively planned, patient-level data meta-analysis across 3 trials demonstrated a significant treatment (AI versus tamoxifen) by marker (HER2) interaction in a multivariate analysis; (interaction hazard ratio [HR] = 1.61, 95% CI 1.01-2.57; p < 0.05). Heterogeneity between trials did not reach statistical significance. The HER2 negative (HER2-ve) group gained greater benefit from AI versus tamoxifen (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.56-0.87) than the HER2-positive (HER2+ve) group (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.75-1.71). However, the small number of HER2+ve cases (n = 1092 across the 3 trials) and distant recurrences (n = 111) may explain heterogeneity between trials.Conclusions: A patient-level data meta-analysis demonstrated a significant interaction between HER2 status and treatment with AI versus tamoxifen in the first 2-3 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients with HER2-ve cancers experienced improved outcomes (distant relapse) when treated with upfront AI rather than tamoxifen, whilst patients with HER2+ve cancers fared no better or slightly worse in the first 2-3 years. However, the small number of HER2+ve cancers/events may explain a large degree of heterogeneity in the HER2+ve groups across all 3 trials. Other causes, perhaps related to subtle differences between AIs, cannot be excluded and warrant further exploration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls

734,Multi-Agent Learning in the Game of Guarding a Territory,2017,"We consider the problem of having a team of guards to learn a joint cooperative strategy to pursue and capture a high speed invader before the invader can reach a territory. In this scenario, the invader is also simultaneously learning its optimal strategy to avoid capture and get as close as possible to the territory. This conflict of interest between the learning agents makes the problem challenging. We adopt the guarding a territory game framework to model the problem, and consider the use of reinforcement learning, particularly the fuzzy actor-critic learning method, to train the players to find their optimal strategies simultaneously. To our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the development of multi-agent learning for a high speed super invader in the game of guarding a territory. Simulation results from this study demonstrate that all the players are able to learn their optimal behaviors simultaneously.",,第3页.xls

In particular, we consider the problem of congestion management between robots and robots and human agents in an automated factory or warehouse. The main contribution of this work is the development of appropriate ensemble models that describe the collective dynamics of the system to identify regions of high congestion. These models are used to design appropriate agent-level feedback control policies to improve the performance of the robotic team. To reduce the frequency of robot-robot and robot-human interactions, the feedback control policies implemented by the individual robots are designed to control the variances in the robot population distribution in the workspace.

737,How to get the right outfit for my agent? Classification and design methodology for a virtual shopping assistant in a 3D world,1999,"The development of software agent technology is one of the great success stories of the late 1990s. From direct manipulation to delegation seems to be the trend which is leading the HCI community into the new millennium. Agent technology will not stay in offices and on the Internet. The dissemination of private PCs, home automation technology and interactive TV provides the basis to enter the area of the residential user. The more that software agent technologies conquer the private area, the stronger becomes the need to ask the user about his requirements and attitudes to agent technology. Current agent classification models are mostly functionally-driven, and hence lack the discussion of appearance parameters. On the other hand, the appearance of an agent has a great influence on the user's attitude to using it. In order to give designers of agent-based applications practicable and relevant help, we extend the functional description model for agents with an appearance model, which comprises dialogue and presentation capabilities. A classification of software agents is shown for the home environment, focusing on the use of interactive TV technologies.",,第3页.xls

This paper presents an experimental design for assessing human behavior in emergency evacuation of an aircraft among a team of players in a game set in a virtual environment. We present the sense of presence in a virtual environment as a possible way of validating human behavior and crowd simulation models. We are conducting a pilot experiment to explore crowd simulation in aircraft evacuation using Virtual Reality to achieve high levels of presence and thus could be used as a framework for validating crowd behavior simulations. We present two approaches for controlling crowd behavior. First by defining rules for computer simulated agents, second by providing controls to the users to navigate in the environment as autonomous agents and guiding other agents. Our contribution lies in our approach to combining these two approaches of behavior in order to simulate the crowd behavior in emergencies.",,第3页.xls
740,Modelling Human Activity in People-Oriented Programming with Metamodels,2015,"People-oriented programming(POP) is a new paradigm for developing individual-oriented software applications and associated devices that entails four defining elements.

As aself-ethnographeradministering and usingCultural Probes, sensors, personalRole ModelsandScenariosto gather their own data and requirements. 3. Asend-user developers, coming up with their own solutions to match their personal needs, utilising user-friendly computer languages, development environments and software toolkits designed to make the user the centre of innovation in new product development. The fourth defining element of POP is thecognitive and emotion-led modellingbehind the tools, techniques and frameworks upon which the user toolkits are built. The models are drawn from two perspectives that rely on Psychology: theAgent-Oriented paradigmand its connection withCognitive Task Modelling;and from Emotion-led Modelling for requirements gathering. POP draws upon research from the analysis, design and development paradigms of software development, software engineering and from within HCI (Human Computer Interaction) including Task Analysis. Many user-friendly tools and coding environments exist that can service POP developers. However further research is needed to provide a broad selection of tools to cater for everybody interested. After defining the four elements of POP this paper concentrates on cognitive and emotion-led modelling of peoples activities, examining meta-models drawn from Task Analysis and the Agent-Oriented paradigm. The meta-models are of interest in the service of the third element: to be used as foundational structures in building new, highly usable and well-engineered development tools for end-users to code or configure solutions that service their own needs. The ShaMAN meta-model is described and presented as a potential foundational structure.",,第3页.xls
741,A new solution for multi-region transmission congestion management,2006,"The rapid growth of inter-regional trading among electricity markets requires the development of new market-oriented mechanisms for the multi-regional congestion management of such trading. In the deregulated power system, the challenge of congestion management for the transmission system operator is to create a set of rules that ensure sufficient control over producers and consumers to maintain an acceptable level of power system security and reliability in both the short term and the long time term while maximizing market efficiency. A decentralized approach is suggested to solve the problem using multi-agent technology in this paper.

While these systems have the potential to supplement typical analysis workflows of data analysts in enterprise data platforms, unfortunately, CASs are subject to the same data discovery challenges that analysts have encountered over the years silos of multimodal data sources, created across teams and departments within an organization, make it difficult to identify appropriate data sources for accomplishing the task at hand. Existing data discovery benchmarks do not model such multimodality and multiplicity of data sources. Moreover, benchmarks of CASs prioritize only evaluating end-to-end task performance. To catalyze research on evaluating the data discovery performance of multimodal data retrievers in CASs within a real-world setting, we propose CMDBench, a benchmark modeling the complexity of enterprise data platforms.

743,User perceptions of communicative and task-competent agents in a virtual basketball game,2015,"In this paper, we describe a virtual basketball game where a human and an embodied agent can play together as a team. Our goal is to investigate whether the human prefers an agent who is highly competent at basketball or one which is not as competent but tries to actively communicate through body movements. The virtual basketball game was implemented using a Kinect to sense body movements and a pressure sensor for hands-free navigation. In order to create an agent who could react to a users body movements, we designed an agent model based on joint activity theory. We performed an experiment where participants would play virtual basketball with each agent and evaluated them through questionnaires. It was found that participants preferred the agent which tried to communicate more with the user, even though they could distinguish that the other agent was better at playing basketball. We propose that communication capability for these types of agents is crucial, even at the expense of some task ability.",,第3页.xls

745,Forensic Analysis of Artifacts from Microsoft's Multi-Agent LLM Platform AutoGen,2024,"Innovations in technology bring new challenges that need to be addressed, especially in the field of technical artifact discovery and analysis that enables digital forensic practitioners. Digital forensic analysis of these innovations is a constant challenge for digital investigators. In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), keeping up with the digital forensic analysis of each new tool is a difficult task. New, advanced Large Language Model (LLM)s can produce human-like artifacts because of their complex textual processing capabilities. One of the newest innovations is a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework by Microsoft called AutoGen. AutoGen enables the creation of a team of specialist Large Language Model (LLM)-backed agents where the agents chat with each other to plan, iterate, and determine when a given task is complete. Typically one of the agents represents the human user while the other agents work autonomously after the human gives each agent a responsibility on the team. Thus, from a digital forensics perspective, it is necessary to determine which artifacts are created by the human user and which artifacts are created by the autonomous agents. Analysis in this work indicates that the current implementation of AutoGen has little in artifacts for attribution outside of particular memory artifacts, yet has strong indicators of usage in disk and network artifacts. Our research provides the initial account on the digital artifacts of the Large Language Model (LLM) technology AutoGen and first artifact examination for a Large Language Model (LLM) framework.",,第3页.xls
746,The role of roles in designing effective agent organizations,2003,"Agent-based systems are no longer contained within the boundaries of a single, small agent organization. To meet the demands of large-scale system implementations, agent organizations must deal with environmental forces, interact with other agent organizations, and know how they affect individual agents. In this paper, we look to social and organizational systems theory as a source of inspiration.. Many of these techniques have been successful for a hundreds and thousands of years. We believe that the designers of agent-based systems can learn a great deal from organization designers. In the first of a series, this paper examines the notion of role and its implications on how agents might behave in group settings.",,第3页.xls

748,Capturing an intruder in product networks,2007,"In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of capturing an intruder in a product network. This solution is derived based on the assumption of existing algorithms for basic member graphs of a graph product. In this problem, a team of cleaner agents are responsible for capturing a hostile intruder in the network. While the agents can move in the network one hop at a time, the intruder is assumed to be arbitrarily fast in a way that it can traverse any number of nodes contiguously as far as no agents reside in those nodes. Here, we consider a version of the problem where each agent can replicate new agents. Thus, the algorithm starts with a single agent and new agents are created on demand. We propose a novel method for deriving intrusion capturing algorithms based on the abstract idea of spanning search trees. Later, we utilize this method for deriving capturing algorithms for Cartesian product graphs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls
749,Distributed behavior-based multi-agent system for automatic segmentation of brain MR images,2007,A novel multi-agent image segmentation system for MR Images is proposed. The agents are behavior-based autonomous entities that are situated in the image as their environment. The agents have local knowledge and cooperate in an implicit and simple manner to achieve globally rational team behavior. Incremental design of agents and their simple interactions facilitate incorporation of expert knowledge and properties of the specific application in the agents' mind.

The system is also proved to be robust against initialization of the agents.,,第3页.xls

However, modeling methodologies and tools for autonomous objects in CPS are still lacking. In this paper, the CPS-Agent is proposed to model objects with consideration of temporal-spatial traits and interaction with physical environment. It is formulated by a fivetuple. Furthermore, considering that no universal methodology of coordination strategy formulation could be used to guide researchers, we present a role-based strategy formulation to make work patterns of CPS-Agents more clear. In terms of network communication among CPS-Agents, a set of communicative primitives is tailored based on the FIPA-ACL specification. Afterward, to guide engineers in designing systems according to their application requirements in the area of CPS, we design templates and a novel visual support tool for generating C++ files automatically corresponding to customized CPS-Agents, coordination strategies, and coordination groups.

752,Towards a logical approach for soccer agents engineering,2001,"Building agents for a scenario such as the RoboCup simulation league requires not only methodologies for implementing a high-level complex behavior, but also the careful and efficient programming of low-level facilities. The development of RoboLog Koblenz is described. The focus is on the declarativity of the approach. This means agents are implemented in a logic- and rule-based manner in the high-level and flexible logic programming language Prolog. Logic is used as a control language for deciding how an agent should behave in a situation where there possibly is more than one choice. We employ state machines which are represented by statecharts, such that we are now able to specify plans with iterative parts and also reactive behaviors triggered by external events. The multi-agent behavior can be described in a script language, where procedural aspects are specified by statecharts and declarative aspects by logical rules.

Furthermore, the initial interaction patterns can be preserved under the designed protocol and the average tracking can be achieved within fixed time, where the bound of settling time is independent of the initial conditions.

756,Locating a black hole in an un-oriented ring using tokens: The case of scattered agents,2007,"Black hole search in a ring network has been studied in a token model. It is known that locating the black hole in an anonymous ring using tokens is feasible, if the team of agents is initially co-located. When dealing with the scattered agents, the problem was so far solved only when the orientation of the ring is known. In this paper, we prove that a black hole can be located in a ring using tokens with scattered agents, even if the ring is un-oriented. More precisely, first we prove that the black hole search problem can be solved using only three scattered agents. We then show that, with k (k >= 4) scattered agents, the black hole can be located fewer moves. Moreover, when k (k >= 4) is a constant number, the move cost can be made optimal.

758,Offensive Strategy in the 2D Soccer Simulation League Using Multi-group Ant Colony Optimization,2016,"The 2D soccer simulation league is one of the best test beds for the research of artificial intelligence (AI). It has achieved great successes in the domain of multi-agent cooperation and machine learning. However, the problem of integral offensive strategy has not been solved because of the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the environment. In this paper, we present a novel offensive strategy based on multi-group ant colony optimization (MACO-OS). The strategy uses the pheromone evaporation mechanism to count the preference value of each attack action in different environments, and saves the values of success rate and preference in an attack information tree in the background. The decision module of the attacker then selects the best attack action according to the preference value. The MACO-OS approach has been successfully implemented in our 2D soccer simulation team in RoboCup competitions. The experimental results have indicated that the agents developed with this strategy, along with related techniques, delivered outstanding performances.",,第3页.xls

762,Teaching coordinated strategies to soccer robots via imitation,2012,Developing coordination among multiple agents and enabling them to exhibit teamwork is a challenging yet exciting task that can benefit many of the complex real-life problems. This research uses imitation to learn collaborative strategies for a team of agents. Imitation based learning involves learning from an expert by observing him/her demonstrating a task and then replicating it. The key idea is to involve multiple human experts during demonstration to teach autonomous agents how to work in coordination. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been assessed in a goal defending scenario of the RoboCup Soccer Simulation 3D league. The process involves multiple human demonstrators controlling soccer agents via game controllers and demonstrating them how to play soccer in coordination. The data gathered during this phase is used as training data to learn a classification model which is later used by the soccer agents to make autonomous decisions during actual matches. Different performance evaluation metrics are derived to compare the performance of imitating agent with that of the human-driven agent and hand-coded (if-then-else rules) agent.,,第3页.xls

A multi-agent based simulation is adopted to represent two identical working environments in which mobile workers are allocated with geographically distributed tasks. In the simulation, the performance of the two approaches is compared in consideration of their ability of exception handling. The results show that the information update frequency and the type of exceptions affect the performance of centralized approach.",,第3页.xls
766,Distributed serum in research project management,2007,"Can research projects be agile? In this paper we describe our proposal of applying Serum for the management of an European research project aimed at developing an agent-based software platform for European economic policy design. The use of an agile, adaptive methodology is justified because successful research projects are complex, unstable processes, that should be continuously adapted along their way. We describe in detail the roles, artifacts and practices of the proposed process, and the first steps of its adoption.",,第3页.xls
767,Determination of Function-Behavior-Structure Model Transition Probabilities from Real-world Data,2019,The Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model of design provides an abstracted model of the cognitive processes of designers and engineers. The FBS model can be used to quantify the time it takes an engineer to complete a design and models this process as a first-order Markov process. Previous efforts to quantify the Markov process transition probabilities have been based on mock design sessions of simple systems. This paper describes a method for taking real-world data on engineering performance to develop FBS transition probabilities. These probabilities can then be used within an FBS model to assess the performance of an engineering team in completing a system design. In future work this improved model will be part of an agents cognitive model in an agent-based simulation.,,第3页.xls
768,Learning to Reason in Round-based Games: Multi-task Sequence Generation for Purchasing Decision Making in First-person Shooters [arXiv],2020,"Sequential reasoning is a complex human ability, with extensive previous research focusing on gaming AI in a single continuous game, round-based decision makings extending to a sequence of games remain less explored. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), as a round-based game with abundant expert demonstrations, provides an excellent environment for multi-player round-based sequential reasoning. In this work, we propose a Sequence Reasoner with Round Attribute Encoder and Multi-Task Decoder to interpret the strategies behind the round-based purchasing decisions. We adopt few-shot learning to sample multiple rounds in a match, and modified model agnostic meta-learning algorithm Reptile for the meta-learning loop. We formulate each round as a multi-task sequence generation problem. Our state representations combine action encoder, team encoder, player features, round attribute encoder, and economy encoders to help our agent learn to reason under this specific multi-player round-based scenario. A complete ablation study and comparison with the greedy approach certify the effectiveness of our model. Our research will open doors for interpretable AI for understanding episodic and long-term purchasing strategies beyond the gaming community.",,第3页.xls
769,Distributed Sensing Subject to Temporal Logic Constraints,2018,"This paper considers the combination of temporal logic (TL) specifications and local objective functions to create online, multiagent, motion plans. These plans are guaranteed to satisfy a persistent mission TL specification and locally optimize an objective function (e.g. in this paper, a cost based on information entropy). The presented approach decouples the two tasks by assigning sub-teams of agents to fulfill the TL specification, while unassigned agents optimize the objective function locally. This paper also presents a novel decoupling of the classic product automaton based approach while maintaining satisfaction guarantees. We also qualitatively show that optimality loss in the local greedy minimization due to the TL constraints can be approximated based on specification complexity. This approach is evaluated with a set of simulations and an experiment of 6 robots with real sensors.",,第3页.xls
770,Drafting Agent-Based Modeling Into Basketball Analytics,2019,"The growth of sports analytics (SA) has raised numerous research topics across a variety of sports, including basketball. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has great potential to assist and inform SA, but to date it has not been utilized. To support the use of ABM in SA, a model of a basketball game, which considers most fundamentals of play, is presented. Additionally, player behavior is partially predicated on assessing the length of a players shooting streak (testing the hot-hand effect) and the consideration a team gives to a streak and their franchise player. The models output is used to calibrate and validate it against statistics from the National Basketball Association (NBA). Via a set of experiments, the model indicates that an increased belief in the franchise player leads to increased scoring action, but a belief in the hot-hand a minor effect. Thereby, demonstrating the utility of ABM to SA, thus opening a new research field.",,第3页.xls
771,Biasing coevolutionary search for optimal multiagent behaviors,2006,"Cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (CEAs) offer great potential for concurrent multiagent learning domains and are of special utility to domains involving teams of multiple agents. Unfortunately, they also exhibit pathologies resulting from their game-theoretic nature, and these pathologies interfere with finding solutions that correspond to optimal collaborations of interacting agents. We address this problem by biasing a cooperative CEA in such a way that the fitness of an individual is based partly on the result of interactions with other individuals (as is usual), and partly on an estimate of the best possible reward for that individual if partnered with its optimal collaborator. We justify this idea using existing theoretical models of a relevant subclass of CEAs, demonstrate how to apply biasing in a way that is robust with respect to parameterization, and provide some experimental evidence to validate the biasing approach. We show that it is possible to bias coevolutionary methods to better search for optimal multiagent behaviors.",,第3页.xls
772,Counseling (ro)bot as a use case for 5G/6G,2022,"This paper presents a counseling (ro)bot called Visual Counseling Agent (VICA) which focuses on remote mental healthcare. It is an agent system leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to aid mentally distressed persons through speech conversation. The system terminals are connected to servers by the Internet exploiting Cloud-nativeness, so that anyone who has any type of terminal can use it from anywhere. Despite a promising voice communication interface, VICA shows limitations in conversation continuity on conventional 4G networks. Concretely, the use of the current 4G networks produces word dropping, delayed response, and the occasional connection failure. The objective of this paper is to mitigate these issues by leveraging a 5G/6G slice inclusive of mobile/multiple edge computing (MEC). First, we propose and partly implement the enhanced and advanced version of VICA. Servers of enhanced versions collaborate to increase speech recognition reliability. Although it significantly increases generated data volume, the advanced version enables a recognition of the facial expressions to greatly enhance counseling quality. Then, we propose a quality assurance mechanism using multiple levels of catalog, as well as 5G/6G slice inclusive of MEC, and conduct experiments to uncover issues related to the 4G. Results indicate that the number of speech recognition errors in Internet Cloud is more than twofold compared to edge computing, implying that quality assurance using 5G/6G in conjunction with VICA Counseling (ro)bot has higher efficiency.",,第3页.xls
773,Multi-agent approach based on a design process for the optimization of mechatronic systems,2017,"Mechatronic design optimization is a complex process characterized by an important number of requirements, design variables, constraints and objectives. Therefore, it is very important to decompose efficiently the system design problem into a set of partitions to minimize the computational cost while profiting from the spatial distribution of design tools, working teams and expertise. However, the optimization of the overall design requires incorporating the relevant partitions in order to find the optimum mechatronic design. Efficient strategies of partitioning and coordination should be specified at the conceptual level to have a successful optimization process. In this paper, a new approach based on multi-agent paradigm is proposed for mechatronic design optimization. The proposed approach is applied to the preliminary design case of an electric vehicle to demonstrate its validity and effectiveness.",,第3页.xls
774,A Decentralized Approach to Multi-agent Planning in the Presence of Constraints and Uncertainty,2011,"We address the problem of planning in the presence of uncertainty and constraints for teams of unmanned vehicles. The problem is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (C-MDP). We allow for plans with a non-zero but bounded probability of violating constraints, a quantity that we define as risk and provide a solution technique that keeps the risk below a specified threshold while optimizing reward. We also use the decoupling between the dynamics of individual agents to assume transition independence and use this assumption to reduce the complexity of the problem. We provide representative simulation results to show that our technique achieves high reward while keeping risk bounded.",,第3页.xls
775,VWM: An improvement to multiagent coordination in highly dynamic environments,2007,"This paper is aimed to describe a general improvement over the previous work on the cooperative multiagent coordination. The focus is on highly dynamic environments where the message transfer delay is not negligible. Therefore, the agents shall not count on communicating their intentions along the time they are making the decisions, because this will directly add the communication latencies to the decision making phase. The only way for the agents to be in touch is to communicate and share their beliefs, asynchronously with the decision making procedure. Consequently, they can share similar knowledge and make coordinated decisions based on it. However, in a very dynamic environment, the shared knowledge may not remain similar clue to the communication limitations and latencies. This may lead to some inconsistencies in the team coordination performance. Addressing this issue, we propose to hold another abstraction of the environment, called Virtual World Model (VWM), for each agent in addition to its primary internal world state. The primary world state is updated as soon as a new piece of information is received while the information affects the VWM through a synchronization mechanism. The proposed idea has been implemented and tested for Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) RoboCupRescue simulation team, the 3(rd) winner of the 2006 worldcup competitions.",,第3页.xls

A virtual USAR robotic competition was established in 2006 under the RoboCup umbrella to foster collaboration amongst institutions and to provide benchmark test environments for system evaluation. In this paper we describe the physics based software simulation framework that is used in this competition and the rules and performance metrics used to determine the league's winner. The framework allows for the realistic modeling of robots, sensors, and actuators, as well as complex, unstructured, dynamic environments. Multiple heterogeneous agents can be concurrently placed in the simulation environment thus allowing for team or group evaluations.",,第3页.xls
777,Co-evolutionary Information Gathering for a Cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Team,2009,"Persistent surveillance and reconnaissance tasks in mobile cooperative sensor networks are key to constructing recognized domain pictures over a variety of civilian and military problem instances. However, efficient information gathering for a task such as target search by a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) still remains a major challenge to achieve system-wide performance objective. Given problem complexity, most proposed distributed target search solutions so for consider simplifying assumptions such as predetermined path planning coordination strategy with implicit communication and ad hoc heuristics, and severely constrained resources. In this paper, we extend previous work reported on multi-UAV target search by learning resource-bounded multi-agent coordination, involving explicit action control coordination. The approach first relies on a new information-theoretic co-evolutionary algorithm to solve cooperative search path planning over receding horizons, providing agents with mutually adaptive and self-organizing behavior. The anytime algorithm is coupled to an extended information-sharing policy to periodically exchange world-state information and projected agent intents. Preliminary results show the value of the proposed approach in comparison to existing techniques or methods.",,第3页.xls
778,Acquiring Multiagent Cooperative Behavior in the RoboCup Soccer Simulation,2019,"The RoboCup Soccer Simulation is a research platform for multiagent systems and artificial intelligence. It is based on the RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulator, which enables two teams of 11 autonomous player agents and an autonomous coach agent to play a game of soccer with highly realistic rules and game play. The soccer simulation has devoted more attention to teamwork techniques than to robot control techniques. Therefore, we can avoid the burdens of developing and maintaining mechanical devices and also developing complex robot control tasks such as bipedal walking. These characteristics enable us to concentrate on research efforts related to teamwork.In order to acquire an appropriate teamwork, we need cooperative behavior models for coordinating teammate players, the methods to analyze opponent team behavior, and adaptaion techniques to the opponent strategy. As successful approaches to the first problem, we have proposed two important methods, a positioning model using triangulation and a sequential action planning using a tree-search method. These methods have already been implemented in our released code. In this talk, I introduce the effectiveness of these methods and the overview of our software. The recent research/development topics in the soccer simulation, especially opponent modeling and adaptation technique, are also introduced.",,第3页.xls
779,A qualitative evaluation criterion for human-robot interaction system in achieving collective tasks,2012,"This work intends to identify common performance metrics for task-oriented human-robot interaction. We present a methodology to assess the system performance of a human-robot team in achievement of collective tasks. We propose a systematic approach that addresses the performance of both the human user and the robotic agent as a team. Toward this end, we attempt to determine the true time that an operator has to dedicate to a robot in action. We define the robot attention demand (RAD) as a function of both direct interaction time (DIT) and indirect interaction time (IIT), where the IIT is a direct consequence of the human trust in automation. We propose a two-level fuzzy temporal model to evaluate the human trust in automation while interacting with robots. Another fuzzy temporal model is presented to evaluate the human reliability during interaction time. The model is then generalized to accommodate multi-robot scenarios. Sequential and parallel robot cooperation schemes with varying levels of task dependency are considered. The fuzzy knowledge bases are further updated by implementing an application robotic platform where robots and users interact naturally to complete tasks with varying levels of complexity. User feedback is noted and used to tune the knowledge base rules where needed, to better represent a human expert's knowledge.",,第3页.xls
780,Decision-Making Assistance in Engineering-Change Management Process,2011,"Effective engineering-change management (ECM) is a real challenge in mechanical engineering industry and manufacturing companies. Computer-aided design systems are usually connected to other systems such as ERP or product data management, but currently this integration does not provide effective means to manage engineering change (EC). While communication between multidisciplinary teams working on a project is known to have a significantly positive impact on the ECM, the communication between disciplines is generally performed solely through message exchange. Experts could feel the need to meet to agree on the requested changes, which in turn translates into longer design and manufacturing processes. There is a need for a system that assists human experts in making decisions about ECs. Such a system will considerably reduce the processing time following a change-request procedure. This paper proposes a collaborative tool named EchoMag, which assists designers and experts during the change-management process. The proposed system ensures the coherence of data between the various disciplines involved in the change process. EchoMag also assists experts in making decisions by proposing alternative solutions when change requests are not agreed upon. Software agents were used to implement EchoMag for which a prototype was developed. Results of the implementation are discussed.",,第3页.xls

Based on this platform, the development process of software organizations can be fully automatically controlled. In this way, not only the imbedded development process of RUP/TSP/PSP may be efficiently supported, but the task assignment and work load balance in TSP can be effectively accomplished and wholly gather productivity data of organizations, teams and individuals, so as to realize quantity management.

COVID-19 AI & Simulation Project under the cabinet secretariat of the Japanese Government aims at providing risk mitigation measures for COVID- 19 infection using technological solutions as well as informing a range of simulation results and data analysis for quality decision making by the policymakers. The simulation team was composed of experts from diverse fields with different modeling approaches including the SIR model, multi-agent modeling, complex network, deep learning, macro-economic models, etc. Our simulation was regularly reported to the minister in charge of COVID-19 issues and to the prime minister whenever appropriate affecting the decision-making of multiple key issues. These include timing to make and lift the state of emergency, vaccination strategy, prediction of spread and convergence of infection and demands for medical resources, and potential exit strategy aiming at return to normal social activities.

Much research has been made on multi-agent system (MAS) in CSCD field, especially on conflict handling, which is not yet well-addressed due to its sophistication. Conflict resolution plays a central role in collaborative design. In this paper, a prototype system of conflict resolution is presented, adopting solution of deadlock problems in the operating system to conflict prevention and classifying the conflicts to match solution strategies according to their features. Video conference negotiation strategy based on MICAD(Multimedia Intelligent CAD) platform, which is researched and implemented by our team, is adopted to deal with new conflicts that can not get matching strategies.",,第3页.xls
784,Online Explanation Generation for Human-Robot Teaming [arXiv],2019,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes an integral part of our life, the development of explainable AI, embodied in the decision-making process of an AI or robotic agent, becomes imperative. For a robotic teammate, the ability to generate explanations to explain its behavior is one of the key requirements of an explainable agency. Prior work on explanation generation focuses on supporting the reasoning behind the robot's behavior. These approaches, however, fail to consider the cognitive effort needed to understand the received explanation. In particular, the human teammate is expected to understand any explanation provided before the task execution, no matter how much information is presented in the explanation. In this work, we argue that an explanation, especially complex ones, should be made in an online fashion during the execution, which helps to spread out the information to be explained and thus reducing the cognitive load of humans. However, a challenge here is that the different parts of an explanation are dependent on each other, which must be taken into account when generating online explanations. To this end, a general formulation of online explanation generation is presented. We base our explanation generation method in a model reconciliation setting introduced in our prior work. Our approach is evaluated both with human subjects in a standard planning competition (IPC) domain, using NASA Task Load Index, as well as in simulation with ten different problems.",,第3页.xls
785,Enforcing Methodological Rules During Collaborative Brainstorming to Enhance Results,2019,"In order to get better results during brainstorming activities participants must respect some rules when they write notes about ideas and when they consider notes written by somebody else. We argue that the respect of these rules can be verified by a multi -agent system analyzing videos and notes produced by the participants in real time. This system can simplify the role of the meeting facilitator. Feedback is sent individually or is addressed globally to the entire team. This paper presents considerations about the necessity of rules, the structure of a multi -agent system for analyzing the respect of those rules and how experiments could show the level of acceptance by people of such a system. The goal of this prospective research is to add a non intrusive system during brainstorming sessions in order to enhance the quality of results.",,第3页.xls
786,Methodology vs. Development Process: A Case Study for AOSE,2009,"There is a general agreement in the fact that Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) needs development process definition for an accurate process management. The main trends in the field identify process and methodology in order to approach the process definition. This paper focusses in the idea that process and methodology must be considered independently. This means that not only the same process can be used for different methodologies but also that the same methodology can be used following different processes. The most suitable process can be selected by developers depending on several factors such as: human resources available, time restrictions, costs, etc. The previous approach is justified introducing a case study, which shows how different development processes can be applied while the team is following the same methodology (in particular, INGENIAS methodology).",,第3页.xls

Over the past three years, more than 30 stabbings have occurred in school campuses, with hundreds of people being injured or killed. This paper computationally examines the consequences of people's actions during a university campus attack using a combination of agent-based simulation and GIS mapping. Experimental results suggest that when facing an attacker with a knife, people should team up and attempt to subdue the attacker, whereas when facing an attacker with a gun, people should flee the area and wait for law enforcement to arrive if they cannot subdue the attacker quickly.",,第3页.xls
788,Online Explanation Generation for Planning Tasks in Human-Robot Teaming,2020,"As AI becomes an integral part of our lives, the development of explainable AI, embodied in the decision-making process of an AI or robotic agent, becomes imperative. For a robotic teammate, the ability to generate explanations to justify its behavior is one of the key requirements of explainable agency. Prior work on explanation generation has been focused on supporting the rationale behind the robot's decision or behavior. These approaches, however, fail to consider the mental demand for understanding the received explanation. In other words, the human teammate is expected to understand an explanation no matter how much information is presented. In this work, we argue that explanations, especially those of a complex nature, should be made in an online fashion during the execution, which helps spread out the information to be explained and thus reduce the mental workload of humans in highly cognitive demanding tasks. However, a challenge here is that the different parts of an explanation may be dependent on each other, which must be taken into account when generating online explanations. To this end, a general formulation of online explanation generation is presented with three variations satisfying different online properties. The new explanation generation methods are based on a model reconciliation setting introduced in our prior work. We evaluated our methods both with human subjects in a simulated rover domain, using NASA Task Load Index (TLX), and synthetically with ten different problems across two standard IPC domains. Results strongly suggest that our methods generate explanations that are perceived as less cognitively demanding and much preferred over the baselines and are computationally efficient.",,第3页.xls
789,"From Cognitive Agents to Cognitive Systems: Theoretical, Methodological, and Empirical Developments of van Gelder's (1998) Dynamical Hypothesis.",2024,"Over two decades have passed since the publication of van Gelder's (1998) dynamical hypothesis. In that paper, van Gelder proposed that cognitive agents were not digital computers-per the representational computational approach-but dynamical systems. The evolution of the dynamical hypothesis was driven by parallel advances in three areas. Theoretically, a deeper understanding of genetics, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science inspired questions about how systems within each domain dynamically interact and extend their effects across spatiotemporal scales. Methodologically, more sophisticated and domain-general tools allowed researchers to discover, model, and quantify system dynamics, structure, and patterns across multiple scales to generate a more comprehensive system-level understanding of behaviors. Empirically, we can analyze a system's behavior while preserving its natural dynamics, revealing evidence that the reductionist approach leads to an incomplete understanding of the components and the overall system. Researchers have traditionally reduced a complex system into its component processes and assumed that the parts can be recombined to explain the whole. These three advances fundamentally altered our understanding of a cognitive agent: How their behaviors are driven by long-range coordination across multiple processes, how the interdependent and nested structure of interacting variables produces behaviors that are greater than the sum of its parts, and how environmental constraints shape adaptive yet stable behavioral patterns.",,第3页.xls
790,Simplified Action Decoder for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning [arXiv],2019,"In recent years we have seen fast progress on a number of benchmark problems in AI, with modern methods achieving near or super human performance in Go, Poker and Dota. One common aspect of all of these challenges is that they are by design adversarial or, technically speaking, zero-sum. In contrast to these settings, success in the real world commonly requires humans to collaborate and communicate with others, in settings that are, at least partially, cooperative. In the last year, the card game Hanabi has been established as a new benchmark environment for AI to fill this gap. In particular, Hanabi is interesting to humans since it is entirely focused on theory of mind, i.e., the ability to effectively reason over the intentions, beliefs and point of view of other agents when observing their actions. Learning to be informative when observed by others is an interesting challenge for Reinforcement Learning (RL): Fundamentally, RL requires agents to explore in order to discover good policies. However, when done naively, this randomness will inherently make their actions less informative to others during training. We present a new deep multi-agent RL method, the Simplified Action Decoder (SAD), which resolves this contradiction exploiting the centralized training phase. During training SAD allows other agents to not only observe the (exploratory) action chosen, but agents instead also observe the greedy action of their team mates. By combining this simple intuition with best practices for multi-agent learning, SAD establishes a new SOTA for learning methods for 2-5 players on the self-play part of the Hanabi challenge. Our ablations show the contributions of SAD compared with the best practice components. All of our code and trained agents are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/Hanabi_SAD.",,第3页.xls
791,A decentralized approach to collaborative driving coordination,2004,"Collaborative driving is an important subcomponent of Intelligent Transportation Systems ITS as it strives to create autonomous vehicles that are able to cooperate in order to navigate through urban traffic by using communications. In this paper, we address this problematic using a platoon of cars considered as a multiagent system. To do that, we propose a hierarchical architecture based on three layers (guidance, management, traffic control) which can be used to develop centralized platoons (where a head vehicle-agent coordinates other vehicle-agents by applying coordination rules) and decentralized platoons (where the platoon is considered as a team of vehicle-agents maintaining the platoon together). We propose the model of teamwork used in multiagent systems as a decentralized alternative to previous coordination centralized on the platoon's leader and outline its benefits using collaborative driving simulation scenarios.",,第3页.xls
792,Investigating human/system interfaces and interactions in a lights-out operational environment,1997,"The concepts of lights-out operations and human/computer interfaces and interactions (HCI) are not incongruous ideas. The concept of automated operations without the immediate presence of people raises interesting and complicated issues associated with human/computer interfaces and interactions when, in fact, people are integrated back into and must interact with the automated operational environment for some complicated problem-solving exercise. The cognitive research proposed to investigate these issues focuses first on the representation question, that is, how best to represent system status to the remotely-located analyst. These concepts are being tested in the lights-out ground operations system (LOGOS), an experimental testbed at NASA-Goddard. Thus, the context of our paper is a mission operations environment that has been automated through the use of agent technology.",,第3页.xls
793,Learning Functions in Large Networks requires Modularity and produces Multi-Agent Dynamics [arXiv],2018,"Networks are abundant in biological systems. Small sized over-represented network motifs have been discovered, and it has been suggested that these constitute functional building blocks. We ask whether larger dynamical network motifs exist in biological networks, thus contributing to the higher-order organization of a network. To end this, we introduce a gradient descent machine learning (ML) approach and genetic algorithms to learn larger functional motifs in contrast to an (unfeasible) exhaustive search. We use the French Flag (FF) and Switch functional motif as case studies motivated from biology. While our algorithm successfully learns large functional motifs, we identify a threshold size of approximately 20 nodes beyond which learning breaks down. Therefore we investigate the stability of the motifs. We find that the size of the real negative eigenvalues of the Jacobian decreases with increasing system size, thus conferring instability. Finally, without imposing learning an input-output for all the components of the network, we observe that unconstrained middle components of the network still learn the desired function, a form of homogeneous team learning. We conclude that the size limitation of learnability, most likely due to stability constraints, impose a definite requirement for modularity in networked systems while enabling team learning within unconstrained parts of the module. Thus, the observation that community structures and modularity are abundant in biological networks could be accounted for by a computational compositional network structure.",,第3页.xls
794,LLCoach: Generating Robot Soccer Plans using Multi-Role Large Language Models,2024,"The deployment of robots into human scenarios necessitates advanced planning strategies, particularly when we ask robots to operate in dynamic, unstructured environments. RoboCup offers the chance to deploy robots in one of those scenarios, a human-shaped game represented by a soccer match. In such scenarios, robots must operate using predefined behaviors that can fail in unpredictable conditions. This paper introduces a novel application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the challenge of generating actionable plans in such settings, specifically within the context of the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) competitions where robots are required to autonomously execute soccer strategies that emerge from the interactions of individual agents. In particular, we propose a multi-role approach leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate and refine plans for a robotic soccer team. The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated through an experimental evaluation,carried out simulating multiple matches where robots with AI-generated plans play against robots running human-built code.",,第3页.xls
795,The privileged sensing framework: a principled approach to improved human-autonomy integration,2018,"A primary goal for human-autonomy integration (HAI) is to balance the strengths of human and autonomy in order to achieve performance objectives more efficiently and robustly than either the human or autonomous agents would independently. This paper proposes the Privileged Sensing Framework (PSF) as a novel approach to HAI. This approach is based on the concept of dynamically privileging information during the process of integration by dynamically bestowing special rights based on the characteristics of each individual agent, the task context, and the performance goals. The proposed framework is tested through a series of simulation experiments that provide a clear demonstration of increased accuracy and throughput of human-autonomy performance. These proof-of-concept simulations provide initial evidence of the utility of the PSF. Continued development of this approach has the potential to revolutionise capabilities of multi-agent cooperative teams across a broad range of applications.",,第3页.xls
796,Puzzy cognitive layer in RoboCupSoccer,2007,"RoboCupSoccer domain has several leagues which varies in the rule of play such as specification of players, number of players, field size, and time length. Nevertheless, each RoboCup league is a variant of a soccer league and therefore they are based on some basic rules of soccer. A layered design of agents system presented in [1] shows a modular approach to build control for a team of robots participating in RoboCupSoccer E-League. Based on this design, we propose a generalized architecture offering flexibility to switch between leagues and programming language while maintaining Prolog as cognitive layer. Prolog is a perfect tool to design strategies for soccer players using simple rules close to human reasoning. Sometimes this reasoning needs to deal with uncertainty, fuzziness or incompleteness of the information. In these cases it is useful Fuzzy Prolog [11,8,10,9]. In this paper we propose to use a combination of Prolog (that is crisp) and Fuzzy Prolog to implement the cognitive layer in RoboCupSoccer, which has the advantage of incorporating as conventional logic as fuzzy logic in this layer. A prototype of a team based on this architecture has been build for RoboCup Soccer Simulator, and we show that this approach provides a convenient way of incorporating a team strategy in high level (human-like) manner, where technical details are encapsulated and fuzzy information is represented.",,第3页.xls
797,A Distributed Approach for Multi-Agent Plan Monitoring and Diagnosis,2015,"Generally, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are used to solve diagnostic problems; however, sometimes we have to diagnosis the MAS itself. As an actual fact, in many concrete cases, complex activities can be decomposed to simpler activities where each simple activity is executed by a particular agent that can be tangible (robot) or intangible (software). In short, the original complex activity is performed with the aid of a team including a set of interacting agents. The present paper proposes a decentralized monitoring methodology that conquers the centralized approach limitations (specially, the scalability property). Precisely, the Global Monitoring Plan (GMP) is split to set of smaller plans which are allocated to monitor agents. Usually, the GMP decomposition generates a set of sub-plans which are dependent. Consequently, all along the monitoring process, the interaction between monitor agents is required to get agent level outputs that are consistent at system level. The proposed approach allows the monitor agent to detect, dynamically, the set of agents involved in the interaction process. This set is called Dependency-Set. In addition, we propose a structured collaboration procedure between the agents belonging to the same Dependency-Set.",,第3页.xls
798,Using a multi-agent evidential reasoning network as the objective function for an evolutionary algorithm,2007,"A culturally diverse group of people are now participating in military multinational coalition operations (e.g., combined air operations center, training exercises such as Red Flag at Nellis AFB, NATO AWACS), as well as in extreme environments. Human biases and routines, capabilities, and limitations strongly influence overall system performance; whether during operations or simulations using models of humans. Many missions and environments challenge human capabilities (e.g., combat stress, waiting, fatigue from long duty hours or tour of duty). This paper presents a team selection algorithm based on an evolutionary algorithm. The main difference between this and the standard EA is that a new form of objective function is used that incorporates the beliefs and uncertainties of the data. Preliminary results show that this selection algorithm will be very beneficial for very large data sets with multiple constraints and uncertainties. This algorithm will be utilized in a military unit selection tool.",,第3页.xls
799,Controlling the behavior of animated presentation agents in the interface -: Scripting versus instructing,2001,"Lifelike characters, or animated agents, provide a promising option for interface development because they allow us to draw on communication and interaction styles with which humans are already familiar. In this contribution, we revisit some of our past and ongoing projects to motivate an evolution of character-based presentation systems. This evolution starts from systems in which a character presents information content in the style of a TV presenter. It moves on with the introduction of presentation teams that convey information to the user by performing role plays. To explore new forms of active user involvement during a presentation, the next step can lead to systems that convey information in the style of interactive performances. From a technical point of view, this evaluation is mirrored in different approaches to determine the behavior of the employed characters. By means of concrete applications, we argue that a central planning component for automated agent scripting is not always a good choice, especially not in the case of interactive performances where the user might take on an active role as well.",,第3页.xls
800,Invited Talk Human-agent Teamwork in Cyber Defense,2012,"Despite the significant attention being given to the critical problems of cyber security, the ability to keep up with the increasing volume and sophistication of network attacks is seriously lagging. Throwing more computing horsepower at fundamentally-limited visualization and analytic approaches will not get us anywhere. Instead, we need to seriously rethink the way cyber security tools and approaches have been conceived, developed, and deployed. IHMC is taking advantage of the combined strengths of humans and software agents to create new capabilities for Network Operations Centers (NOCs). These capabilities are being implemented in a new cyber defense framework called Sol. Our objective is to enable distributed sensemaking, rapid detection of threats, and effective protection of critical resources. Specifically, we use agents, policies, and visualization to enact coactive emergence as a sensemaking strategy for taskwork and teamwork, and we implement capabilities for organic resilience and semantically-rich policy governance as a means of assuring effective and adaptive human-agent team response. IHMC has applied its long years of experience with software agents to the design of a new agent framework called Luna. Luna agents function both as interactive assistants to analysts and as continuously-running background aids to data processing and knowledge discovery. Luna agents achieve much of their power through built-in teamwork capabilities that, in conjunction with IHMCs KAoS policy services framework, allow them to be proactive, collaborative, observable, and directable. In order to support dynamic scalability and other features of the Sol framework, the Luna platform supports the policy-governed option of allowing the state of agents (vs. code of agents) to migrate between operating environments and hosts. We believe that the approach to cyber defense embodied in Sol is equally relevant to applications of distributed sensemaking for other kinds of complex high-tempo tasks such as real-time disease control or disaster management.",,第3页.xls
801,A cooperative search framework for distributed agents,2001,"This paper presents an approach for cooperative search of a team of distributed agents. We consider two or more agents, or vehicles, moving in a geographic environment, searching for targets of interest and avoiding obstacles or threats. The moving agents are equipped with sensors to view a limited region of the environment they are visiting, and are able to communicate with one another to enable cooperation. The agents are assumed to have some physical limitations including possibly maneuverability limitations, fuel/time constraints and sensor range and accuracy. The developed cooperative search framework is based on two inter-dependent tasks: (i) on-line learning of the environment and storing of the information in the form of a search map; and (ii) utilization of the search map and other information to compute on-line a guidance trajectory for the agent to follow. The distributed learning and planning approach for cooperative search is illustrated by computer simulations.",,第3页.xls
802,"Demos: A Distributed Model based on Autonomous, Intelligent Agents with Monitoring and Anticipatory Responses for Energy Management in Smart Cities",2014,"In todays dynamic network environments like smart cities, information evolves in distributed resources and in different forms or modalities. An agent or a system that wants to be actively part of this evolution has to be interactive, adaptive, autonomous and intelligent. The paper presents a new version of a distributed model-framework (called Demos) based on autonomous, intelligent agents with anticipatory responses. The first version of the system was proposed by Mertoguno (1998), and the new features (LG Graphs, SPNs and NNs) were embedded in the version presented here. The Demos model is mainly based on the development of an adaptive distributed knowledge base system. Knowledge is represented in a form of frames with internal stochastic Petri-net graph for local representations (KR). A major advantage for the Demos model having a distributed (possibly across the net) is the adaptive knowledge base. Here the authors present the design of an adaptive knowledge model and its challenge, which lays principally on how to learn new knowledge by synthesising SPN forms, and how to develop anticipatory responses at an agents site. The development of the Demos prototype has a great range of applicability, such as in autonomous negotiating teams, autonomous distributed units for energy efficient distribution, autonomous multiple mobile robots space exploration and maps generation, autonomous intelligent information agents (WWW), automatic information synthesis and fusion, etc. Here the authors have used this model for management of the electric power on a grid of a smart city.",,第3页.xls
803,Vision Based Connectivity Maintenance of a Network with Switching Topology,2010,"Networks of cooperating agents are investigated for formation and coverage control, target tracking, flocking, and consensus applications. Within these applications, agents are required to coordinate to make appropriate decisions and achieve desired goals; hence, the ability to maintain connectivity with other agents is paramount. In this paper, we propose a two level control framework for connectivity maintenance and cooperation of multi-agent systems. Each agent is equipped with an omnidirectional camera and wireless communication capabilities. Image feedback is the primary method to maintain connectivity among agents with wireless communication that is only used to broadcast information when a specific topology change occurs. All agents in the team are categorized as clusterheads or regular nodes. A high level graph is composed of all clusterheads and the motion of the clusterheads is controlled to maintain existing connections among them. A low level graph composed of all regular nodes is controlled to maintain connectivity with respect its specific clusterhead.",,第3页.xls
804,Multi-Agent Coordination Profiles Through State Space Perturbations,2019,"The current work utilized a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm embedded in a continuous predator-prey pursuit simulation environment to measure and evaluate coordination between cooperating agents. In this simulation environment, it is generally assumed that successful performance for cooperative agents necessarily results in the emergence of coordination, but a clear quantitative demonstration of coordination in this environment still does not exist. The current work focuses on 1) detecting emergent coordination between cooperating agents in a multi-agent predator-prey simulation environment, and 2) showing coordination profiles between cooperating agents extracted from systematic state perturbations. This work introduces a method for detecting and comparing the typically 'black-box' behavioral solutions that result from emergent coordination in multi-agent learning spatial tasks with a shared goal. Comparing coordination profiles can provide insights into overlapping patterns that define how agents learn to interact in cooperative multi-agent environments. Similarly, this approach provides an avenue for measuring and framing agents to coordinate with humans. In this way, the present work looks towards understanding and creating artificial team-mates that will strive to coordinate optimally.",,第3页.xls
805,Coordinating human and computer agents,1998,"In many application areas individuals are responsible for an agenda of tasks and face choices about the best way to locally handle each task, in what order to do tasks, and when to do them. Such decisions are often hard to make because of coordination problems: individual tasks are related to the tasks of others in complex ways, and there are many sources of uncertainty (no one has a complete view of the task structure at arbitrary levels of detail, the situation may be changing dynamically, and no one is entirely sure of the outcomes of all of their actions). The focus of this paper is the development of support tools for distributed, cooperative work by groups (collaborative teams) of human and computational agents. We will discuss the design of a set of distributed autonomous computer programs (agents) that assist people in coordinating their activities by helping them to manage their agendas. We describe several ongoing implementations of these ideas including 1) simulated agents and tasks, 2) a real multi-agent system for financial portfolio management, and 3) a real mixed human and computational agent system for concurrent engineering design.",,第3页.xls
806,A case study for life-long learning and adaptation in cooperative robot teams,1999,"While considerable progress has been made in recent years toward the development of multi-robot teams, much work remains to be done before these teams are used widely in real-world applications. Two particular needs toward this end are the development of mechanisms that enable robot teams to generate cooperative behaviors on their own, and the development of techniques that allow these teams to autonomously adapt their behavior over time as the environment or the robot team changes. This paper proposes the use of the Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of Multiple Moving Targets (CMOMMT) application as a rich domain for studying the issues of multi-robot learning and adaptation. After discussing the need for learning and adaptation in multi-robot teams, this paper describes the CMOMMT application and its relevance to multi-robot learning. We discuss the results of the previously-developed, hand-generated algorithm for CMOMMT and the potential for learning that was discovered from the hand-generated approach. We then describe the early work that has been done (by us and others) to generate multi-robot learning techniques for the CMOMMT application, as well as our ongoing research to develop approaches that give performance as good, or better, than the hand-generated approach. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop techniques for multi-robot learning and adaptation in the CMOMMT application domain that will generalize to cooperative robot applications in other domains, thus making the practical use of multi-robot teams in a nide variety of real-world applications much closer to reality.",,第3页.xls
807,Animating computer agents,1996,"To design automation to be a team player, we need to make it observable. Prototype concepts and design principles are introduced to demonstrate how to represent agent activity. These representations are based on field observations and a cognitive work analysis of a startup in a power plant. Our concepts aim to help practitioners to understand the basis for what the automation has done, what it is doing, and what it may do next. Three representation concepts in particular are tailored to automation-specific problems: contribution, continuous modifier and triggering logic graphics. Contribution graphics are used to depict how a set of independent factors contribute to a result showing the summation inherent in many algorithms. Continuous modifier graphics show agent adaptations by depicting how a contributor is discounted or amplified in a context-sensitive way. Triggering logic graphics illustrate how discrete conditional logic can be depicted in relation to many frames of reference.",,第3页.xls
808,Visualizing structural and behavioural aspects of virtual collaboration,2001,"Collaborative virtual environments are becoming increasingly commonplace, moving out of research labs and into professional practice. Among others, they support knowledge-intensive emergent work performed by distributed teams. In these settings inhere conventional awareness is absent, making sense of the virtual collaboration becomes challenging. This paper introduces information visualization that aims to reveal structural and behavioural aspects of virtual collaboration, referring respectively to relationships among elements of the collaboration, and the interactions that occur as part of it. Visualization tools have to be tailored to, and express notions from, the ontology of the virtual environment employed. An example is introduced where instances of collaboration that have taken place within the LiveNet system are visualized, in terms of LiveNet's ontology. Finally, the paper offers an outlook on how visualization tools care be assisted by software agents that learn from, and actively support their human users.",,第3页.xls
809,No regrets about no-regret,2007,"No-regret is described as one framework that game theorists and computer scientists have converged upon for designing and evaluating multi-agent teaming algorithms. However, Shoham, Powers, and Grenager also point out that the framework has serious deficiencies, such as behaving sub-optimally against certain reactive opponents. But all is not lost. With some simple modifications, regret-minimizing algorithms can perform in many of the ways we wish multi-agent learning algorithms to perform, providing safety and adaptability against reactive opponents. We argue that the research community should have no regrets about no-regret methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls
810,"Testing Human-Auto Cyber Team Resilience Uncovering latent failures with a novel, decision-centered approach",2013,"The increased use of automation has been necessary to keep up with the growing cyber-pace and complexity of threats. However, automation benefits do not come for free; the addition of these automated support agents has added additional coordination and supervisory work to the human operator's domain, bringing hidden brittleness along with the benefits. This increased human-automation teamwork calls for the need to complement traditional testing approaches and holistically assess the net decision-making effectiveness and decision-making resilience of the Human-Auto cyber team. Decision Centered Testing (DCT) uncovers problems that would otherwise go unnoticed. By uncovering this joint Human-Automation brittleness, system designers can make necessary system interface and automation design and development improvements to create a more resilient joint cognitive team. Based on Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE), DCT uses test scenarios built around key decision-making demands of the domain, to place pressure on potential areas of weakness between the user and their decision support system (edges) to discover latent design flaws prior to being released into the fight. We present the success of DCT in the Control Domain (The Silent Automation & the Right Sized Hole Case), a DCT methodology introduction and how it can be used in the cyber domain.",,第3页.xls
811,Decentralized Task Allocation in Multi-Agent Systems Using a Decentralized Genetic Algorithm,2020,"In multi-agent collaborative search missions, task allocation is required to determine which agents will perform which tasks. We propose a new approach for decentralized task allocation based on a decentralized genetic algorithm (GA). The approach parallelizes a genetic algorithm across the team of agents, making efficient use of their computational resources. In the proposed approach, the agents continuously search for and share better solutions during task execution. We conducted simulation experiments to compare the decentralized GA approach and several existing approaches. Two objectives were considered: a min-sum objective (minimizing the total distance traveled by all agents) and a min-time objective (minimizing the time to visit all locations of interest). The results showed that the decentralized GA approach yielded task allocations that were better on the min-time objective than those created by existing approaches and solutions that were reasonable on the min-sum objective. The decentralized GA improved min-time performance by an average of 5.6% on the larger instances. The results indicate that decentralized evolutionary approaches have a strong potential for solving the decentralized task allocation problem.",,第3页.xls
812,RoboLog Koblenz 2001,2002,"A formalism for the specification of multiagent systems should be expressive enough to model not only the behavior of one single agent, but also the collaboration among several agents and the influences caused by external events For this, state machines seem to provide an adequate means. Therefore, the approach of the team RoboLog Koblenz 2001 employs techniques from software engineering and artificial intelligence research by using UML statecharts and implementing them systematically with logic and deduction in Prolog. The current work concentrates on formal agent design. The decision process of soccer agents can be made more flexible by introducing utility functions for rational behavior as proposed in. Furthermore, it is desirable to be able to check whether the multiagent system satisfies certain interesting properties. Therefore, the formalism should also allow the verification or the formal analysis of multiagent systems, e.g. by model checking,.",,第3页.xls
813,Robot mother ship design,2000,"Small physical agents will be ubiquitous on the battlefield of the 21(st) century, principally to lower the exposure to harm of our ground forces. Teams of small collaborating physical agents conducting tasks such as Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA); chemical and biological agent detection, logistics, sentry; and communications relay will have advanced sensor and mobility characteristics.The mother ship must effectively deliver/retrieve, service, and control these robots as well as fuse the information gathered by these highly mobile robot teams. The mother ship concept presented in this paper includes the case where the mother ship is itself a robot or a manned system. The mother ship must have long-range mobility to deploy the small, highly maneuverable agents that will operate in urban environments and more localized areas, and act as a logistics base for the robot teams. The mother ship must also establish a robust communications network between the agents and is an up-link point for disseminating the intelligence gathered by the smaller agents; and, because of its global knowledge, provides the high-level information fusion, control and planning for the collaborative physical agents. Additionally, the mother ship incorporates battlefield visualization, information fusion, and multi-resolution analysis, and intelligent software agent technology, to support mission planning and execution.This paper discusses on going research at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory that supports the development of a robot mother ship. This research includes docking, battlefield visualization, intelligent software agents, adaptive communications, information fusion, and multi-modal human computer interaction.",,第3页.xls
814,Developing an educational medical game using AgilePASSI multi-agent methodology,2015,"Games applied to health education have emerged as a motivational improvement in learning and clinical performance of students from the health care area. Currently, there are several agent oriented methodologies that support the multi-agent systems development. However none are specific to the domain of medical and health education. Agent-oriented development of medical educational games must have special features such working with a multidisciplinary team, have a high degree of user involvement and allow a mutuality of game requirements. Within this context, this paper presents the development of MEDEDUC, an educational systems technology applying agile development through the AGILEPASSI methodology.

The results of this study stressed the advantages of the agile development methodology game that combines medical theory and multiagent.",,第3页.xls
815,Single landmark based collaborative multi-agent localization with time-varying range measurements and information sharing,2016,"This paper considers the collaborative localization problem for a team of mobile agents. The goal is to estimate the relative coordinate of each agent with respect to a stationary landmark. Each agent is supposed to be able to measure its own velocity and the distances to nearby agents as well as the change rates of the distances. Due to limited sensing capability, movements of agents and possible interference of severe environments, the topology describing the measurements and communication information flow among the agents and the landmark is usually time-varying. Under such a scenario, this paper develops a consensus-like fusion scheme together with a continuous-time estimator for the collaborative localization problem. It is proved that the fused estimate of each agent's position globally asymptotically converges to its true value if the movements of the agents satisfy a persistent excitation condition and each agent is uniformly jointly reachable from the landmark in the time-varying topology. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through simulations without and with measurement noises. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls
816,Promotion of Selfish Agents in Hierarchical Organisations,2010,"In hierarchical organisations, a preferred outcome is to promote a more productive worker to a more influential status. However, productivity is rarely directly measurable, so an individual worker often has both motive and opportunity to misrepresent his productivity. This leads to an alternative possibility: the promotion of selfish individuals. We use an agent-based model to study how selfishness and competency of agents influence their promotion in hierarchical organisations. We consider the case where selfish agents can overstate their productivity and thus obtain undeserved promotions. Our results suggest that more productive agents reach positions of power most of the time. However, even under ideal conditions, selfish agents occasionally dominate the higher levels of a hierarchical organisation, which in turn has a dramatic effect on all lower levels. For organisations of around 100-10,000 employees with 3-4 hierarchy levels, on average, the promotion of selfish agents is minimized and the promotion of competent agents is maximized. Finally, we show that judging the productivity of an individual agent has a greater impact on promoting selfish behaviour than judging the productivity of an individual's team. These results illustrate that agent-based models provide a powerful framework for examining how local interactions contribute to the large-scale properties of multi-layered organisations.",,第3页.xls
817,Agilo RoboCuppers: RoboCup team description,2000,"This paper describes the Agilo RoboCuppers(1) - the RoboCup team of the image understanding group (FG BV) at the Technische Universitat Munchen. With a team of five Pioneer I robots, equipped with CCD camera and a single board computer each and coordinated by a master PC outside the field we participate in the Middle Robot League of the Third International Workshop on RoboCup in Stockholm 1999. We use a multi-agent based approach to represent different robots and to encapsulate concurrent tasks within the robots. A fast feature extraction based on the image processing library HALCON provides the data necessary for the onboard scene interpretation. In addition, these features as well as the odometric data of the robots are sent over the net to the master PC, where they axe verified with regard to consistency and plausibility and fusioned to one global view of the scene.

In this paper, two types of these disciplines, each of which constructs an organization for agents, are explained and their performances in voltage control of a power system (in the context of steady state regime) are examined and compared on Nordic32 as test power system.

Our system provides the usual facilities for communication among members of the group as well as a friendly programming environment for the functional programming language Haskell. A relevant feature of our learning environment is that some of the students may be, in fact, virtual students. It is worth to point out that these agents will not always behave as helpers. On the contrary, it can happen that they produce, on purpose, wrong programs. By doing so, we pretend that students get the abilities to detect mistakes not only in their own code, but also in the code generated by other team-mates.",,第3页.xls
820,Design and Evaluation of a Mixed-Initiative Planner for Multi-vehicle Missions,2017,"The command and control of multiple vehicles in highly dynamic scenarios by a single operator require high situation awareness and can result in excessive workload.

In order to avoid such issues, we propose a mixed-initiative approach. The article describes our concept and the technical implementation of a mixed-initiative multi-vehicle mission planner. The planner serves as cognitive agent and supports a human operator du-ring planning and re-planning processes. The article focuses on the interaction concept. A first experimental evaluation of the described interaction concept is presented. Our application comprises the teaming of manned and unmanned helicopters in complex military missions.",,第3页.xls
821,Census Signal Temporal Logic Inference for Multi-Agent Group Behavior Analysis [arXiv],2016,"In this paper, we define a novel census signal temporal logic (CensusSTL) that focuses on the number of agents in different subsets of a group that complete a certain task specified by the signal temporal logic (STL). CensusSTL consists of an inner logic STL formula and an outer logic STL formula. We present a new inference algorithm to infer CensusSTL formulae from the trajectory data of a group of agents. We first identify the inner logic STL formula and then infer the subgroups based on whether the agents' behaviors satisfy the inner logic formula at each time point. We use two different approaches to infer the subgroups based on similarity and complementarity, respectively. The outer logic CensusSTL formula is inferred from the census trajectories of different subgroups. We apply the algorithm in analyzing data from a soccer match by inferring the CensusSTL formula for different subgroups of a soccer team. [doi:10.1109/TASE.2016.2611536].",,第3页.xls
822,Concurrent engineering design using intelligent agents,1998,"The motivation for the research and systems development discussed came as a result of the changing emphasis of effective product design from those based principally upon functional criteria towards a life cycle approach. The resulting interactive multimedia CAL (Computer Aided Learning) software system, Design Builder, has two specific learning objectives: (i) to enable undergraduate engineers to experience working in a concurrent environment without the requirement for direct and specialised teaching staff support; and (ii) to provide an interactive and intelligent simulation environment from which users may develop a culture that introduces concurrency in the engineering design process. Today's successful companies are those who introduce a strategic approach to their management practices and actively encourage a team approach to their working culture. Educational provision must meet these requirements with regard to training for employees that reflect a wide working knowledge of methods and processes, whilst having the skills to communicate and work as active members of an integrated and focussed team.

Firstly, we present the model of the organization and proactive information delivery (PID) behaviors of the strike team by means of AML (Agent Modeling Language). Then, we propose the cooperation strike strategy to the TST which includes cooperative tracking, role adjusting and striking behavior adjusting strategy.

824,Image classifier and scene understanding systems of multiagent teams,2000,A multiagent architecture for scene understanding systems is described. Such systems consist of a collection of coupled vision sub-systems each one dedicated to a particular sensor. Interaction between the vision sub-systems is controlled by an organising agent. Each vision sub-system is implemented on the basis of a partition tree image labelling representation and an associated multiagent hierarchy of classifiers controlled by an organising agent. Each classifier in the multiagent hierarchy of classifiers may be implemented as a decision tree of neural network classifiers acting on feature vectors derived from regions in the partition tree. Therefore the image labelling and image classification sub-systems can be described in terms of hierarchical networks of neural networks from which an interpretation in terms of multiagents very naturally follows. The vision sub-systems have a multiresolution image representation and concurrency between and within the image labelling and image classification vision sub-system components.,,第3页.xls
825,Multi-agent trail making for stigmergic navigation,2004,"Robotic agents in dynamic environments must sometimes navigate using only their local perceptions. In complex environments, features such as terrain undulation, geometrically complex barriers, and similar obstacles form local maxima and minima that can trap and hinder agents using reactive navigation. Moreover, agents navigating in a purely reactive fashion forget their past discoveries quickly. Preserving this knowledge usually requires that each agent construct a detailed world model as it explores or he forced to rediscover desired goals each time. Explicit communication can also be required to share discoveries and coordinate actions. The cost of explicit communication can be substantial, however, making it desirable to avoid its use in many domains. Accordingly, in this paper we present a method of cooperative trail making that allows a team of agents using reactive navigation to assist one another in their explorations through implicit (stigmergic) communication.",,第3页.xls
826,Emergent short-term forecasting through ant colony engineering in coordination and control systems,2006,"This manuscript presents a design for the emergent generation of short-term forecasts in multi-agent coordination and control systems. Food foraging behavior in ant colonies constitutes the main inspiration for the design. A key advantage is the limited exposure of the software agents in the coordination and control system. Each agent corresponds to a counterpart in the underlying system and can be developed and maintained exclusively based on knowledge about its counterpart. This approach to make non-local information available without exposing the software agents beyond their local scope is the research contribution and focus of the discussion in this paper. The research team applies this design to multi-agent manufacturing control systems and to supply network coordination systems, but its intrinsic applicability is broader. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

827,A critical examination of the role of appreciative inquiry within an interprofessional education initiative,2011,"Appreciative inquiry (AI) is a relatively new approach to initiating or managing organizational change that is associated with the 'positiveness' movement in psychology and its offshootpositive organizational scholarship. Rather than dwelling upon problems related to change, AI encourages individuals to adopt a positive, constructive approach to managing change. In recent years, AI has been used to initiate change across a broad range of public and private sector organizations. In this article, we report findings from a subset of 50 interviews gathered in a wider study of interprofessional education (IPE) in which AI was employed as a change agent for implementing IPE in a number of health care institutions in a North American setting. A multiple case study approach (Yin, 2002) was employed in the wider study and semi-structured interviews were undertaken with participants both before their IPE programs and directly afterwards to obtain a detailed understanding of their expectations and experiences of IPE. Interviews were analyzed in an inductive thematic manner in order to produce key emergent themes from each of the IPE programs. A process of re-analysis provided a set of themes which offered an understanding of the role of AI within this IPE initiative. Our findings identify a strong resonance and fit for AI both among the health and social care professionals who participated in this initiative. Numerous individuals commented on the enthusiasm and energy AI engendered, while praising its ability to enhance their working lives and interprofessional relationships. Yet a number of difficulties were also reported. These focused on problems with the translation of the AI process into achievable structural level (e. g. professional, cultural) changes. Based on these findings, the article goes on to argue that the use of AI can overlook a number of structural factors, which will ultimately limit its ability to actually secure meaningful and lasting change within health care.",,第3页.xls
828,A Workflow for Network Analysis-Based Structure Discovery in the Assessment Community,2018,"When technology opens up new domains or areas of research, such as human-agent teaming, new challenges in assessments emerge. Assessments may not be as systematically conducted as new measures develop, and the research may not be as firmly grounded in theory since theories in newer domains are still being formulated. As a result, research in these domains can be fragmented. To address these, an empirically-driven network approach that is complementary to the traditional theory-driven approach is proposed. The network approach seeks to discover patterns and structure in the assessment metadata (.e.g., constructs and measures) that can provide starting points and direction for future research. This paper outlines the workflow of the network approach which comprises three steps: (1) Data Preparation; (2) Data Analysis; and (3) Structure Discovery. As most of the work has been on Data Preparation, the paper will focus on the complexities and issues encountered in the first step, and include broad overviews of the subsequent steps. Anticipated use and outcomes of the network approach are also discussed.",,第3页.xls
829,INTENT RECOGNITION IN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS: COW HERDING,2014,"In a multi-agent system, an agent may utilize its idle time to assist other agents in the system. Intent recognition is proposed to accomplish this with minimal communication. An agent performing recognition observes the tasks other agents are performing and, unlike the much studied field of plan recognition, the overall intent of an agent is recognized instead of a specific plan. The observing agent may use capabilities that it has not observed. A conceptual framework is proposed for intent recognition systems. An implementation of the conceptual framework is tested and evaluated. We hypothesize that using intent recognition in a multi-agent system increases utility (where utility is domain specific) and decreases the amount of communication. We test our hypotheses using the domain of Cow Herding, where agents attempt to herd cow agents into team corrals. A set of metrics, including task time and number of communications, is used to compare the performance of plan recognition and intent recognition. In our results, we find that intent recognition agents communicate fewer times than plan recognition agents. In addition, unlike plan recognition, when agents use the novel approach of intent recognition, they select unobserved actions to perform. Intent recognition agents were also able to outperform plan recognition agents by consistently scoring more points in the Cow Herding domain. This research shows that under certain conditions, an intent recognition system is more efficient than a plan recognition system. The advantage of intent recognition over plan recognition becomes more apparent in complex domains.",,第3页.xls
830,A Network Science Approach to Future Human-Robot Interaction,2015,"The vision for future Soldier-robot relationships has supported the transition of the robot's role from a tool to an integrated team member. This vision has provided support for the advancement of robot autonomy and intelligence as a means to better support action and cognitive decision-making in the network-centric operational environment. To accomplish this goal, the Soldier's perspective of the human-robot interaction must be further developed, as it directly impacts overall situation management: mission planning, operational roles, function allocation, and decision-making. Here we present a theoretical concept paper that promotes using the foundation of network science to better understand how and why advances in effective Soldier-robot situation management may be realized. We begin by providing a primer on how a network science approach may be used to understand multi-agent teams and network-centric operations. This is followed with a review on the impact of human perception on the human-robot team network structure. Two key points are highlighted. First, the network structure is influenced by the extent to which a Soldier-robot coupling performs independent operations. Second, the degree of automaticity for several properties of the robot specifies the strength of their networked relationship. We conclude with possible advantages of using a network science approach for understanding situation management of Soldier-robot teams in an operational environment. This approach provides a structure for creating visual maps of team structures to understand perceived and anticipated role interdependency, which thus provides the foundation for developing a mathematical description of the dynamic Soldier-robot relationship.",,第3页.xls
831,"A Little Anthropomorphism Goes a Long Way: Effects of Oxytocin on Trust, Compliance, and Team Performance With Automated Agents",2017,"Objective: We investigated the effects of exogenous oxytocin on trust, compliance, and team decision making with agents varying in anthropomorphism (computer, avatar, human) and reliability (100%, 50%).Background: Authors of recent work have explored psychological similarities in how people trust humanlike automation compared with how they trust other humans. Exogenous administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide associated with trust among humans, offers a unique opportunity to probe the anthropomorphism continuum of automation to infer when agents are trusted like another human or merely a machine.Method: Eighty-four healthy male participants collaborated with automated agents varying in anthropomorphism that provided recommendations in a pattern recognition task.Results: Under placebo, participants exhibited less trust and compliance with automated aids as the anthropomorphism of those aids increased. Under oxytocin, participants interacted with aids on the extremes of the anthropomorphism continuum similarly to placebos but increased their trust, compliance, and performance with the avatar, an agent on the midpoint of the anthropomorphism continuum.Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that administration of exogenous oxytocin affected trust, compliance, and team decision making with automated agents. These effects provide support for the premise that oxytocin increases affinity for social stimuli in automated aids.Application: Designing automation to mimic basic human characteristics is sufficient to elicit behavioral trust outcomes that are driven by neurological processes typically observed in human-human interactions. Designers of automated systems should consider the task, the individual, and the level of anthropomorphism to achieve the desired outcome.",,第3页.xls
832,Cleaning an arbitrary regular network with mobile agents,2005,"In this paper, we consider a contaminated network with an intruder. The task for the mobile agents is to decontaminate all hosts while preventing a recontamination and to do so as efficiently as possible. We study under what conditions and what cost a team of mobile agents can do this in synchronous arbitrary regular graphs using the breadth-first-search strategy. Due to the nature of the experiment we use a genetic algorithm to find the minimum number of agents required to decontaminate a given network. The results show that there is a relation between the degree, the size of the graph, and the number of starting locations of the mobile agents. in particular, this relation demonstrates the possibility of improvements in reducing the number of mobile agents used depending on the number of starting location in arbitrary regular graphs.",,第3页.xls
833,Two-agent formation control of magnetic microrobots,2016,"This paper presents a new method to control multiple micro-scale magnetic agents operating in close proximity to each other for applications in microrobotics. Controlling multiple magnetic microrobots close to each other is difficult due to magnetic interactions between the agents, and here we seek to control those interactions for the creation of desired multi-agent formations. We use the fact that all magnetic agents orient to the global input magnetic field to modulate the local attraction-repulsion forces between nearby agents. Here we study these controlled interaction magnetic forces for agents at a water-air interface and devise two controllers to regulate the inter-agent spacing and heading of the set, for motion in two dimensions. Simulation and experimental demonstrations show the feasibility of the idea and its potential for the completion of complex tasks using teams of microrobots. Average tracking error of less than 73 mum and 14° is accomplished for the regulation of the inter-agent space and the pair heading angle, respectively, for identical disk-shape agents with nominal radius of 500 mum and thickness of 80 mum operating within several body-lengths of each other.",,第3页.xls

836,Multi-agent CORBA-based robotics vision architecture for cue integration,2002,"The robustness of a given vision system in the field of robotics is a very challenging problem and represents a major bottleneck in any industrial setting. Nevertheless, there is a hypothesis that the fusion of multiple natural features facilitates a robust detection and object tracking in scenes of real world complexity. Several fusion methods have been tested for cue integration with good results, but the computational effort grows as the number of features increases. This research work represents a variant of the fusion method based both on distributed systems and on an agent concept. In this work, multiple agents interact with each other to perform different roles. The structure has a cooperative approach so that the agents work as a team. The communication among the agents is based on the Event Service of CORBA technology. By using this architecture, we are exploiting the parallelism and concurrency of distributed systems, and by using the concept of agents we are exploiting the encapsulation concept to built modular systems.",,第3页.xls

838,Motion Fields to Predict Play Evolution in Dynamic Sport Scenes,2010,"Videos of multi-player team sports provide a challenging domain for dynamic scene analysis. Player actions and interactions are complex as they are driven by many factors, such as the short-term goals of the individual player, the overall team strategy, the rules of the sport, and the current context of the game. We show that constrained multi-agent events can be analyzed and even predicted from video. Such analysis requires estimating the global movements of all players in the scene at any time, and is needed for modeling and predicting how the multi-agent play evolves over time on the field. To this end, we propose a novel approach to detect the locations of where the play evolution will proceed, e. g. where interesting events will occur, by tracking player positions and movements over time. We start by extracting the ground level sparse movement of players in each time-step, and then generate a dense motion field. Using this field we detect locations where the motion converges, implying positions towards which the play is evolving. We evaluate our approach by analyzing videos of a variety of complex soccer plays.",,第3页.xls
839,Searching and tracking people with cooperative mobile robots,2018,"Social robots should be able to search and track people in order to help them. In this paper we present two different techniques for coordinated multi-robot teams for searching and tracking people. A probability map (belief) of a target person location is maintained, and to initialize and update it, two methods were implemented and tested: one based on a reinforcement learning algorithm and the other based on a particle filter. The person is tracked if visible, otherwise an exploration is done by making a balance, for each candidate location, between the belief, the distance, and whether close locations are explored by other robots of the team. The validation of the approach was accomplished throughout an extensive set of simulations using up to five agents and a large amount of dynamic obstacles; furthermore, over three hours of real-life experiments with two robots searching and tracking were recorded and analysed.",,第3页.xls
840,Cooperative multi-agent learning: The state of the art,2005,"Cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) are ones in which several agents attempt, through their interaction, to jointly solve tasks or to maximize utility. Due to the interactions among the agents, multi-agent problem complexity can rise rapidly with the number of agents or their behavioral sophistication. The challenge this presents to the task of programming solutions to MAS problems has spawned increasing interest in machine learning techniques to automate the search and optimization process. We provide a broad survey of the cooperative multi-agent learning literature. Previous surveys of this area have largely focused on issues common to specific subareas (for example, reinforcement learning, RL or robotics). In this survey we attempt to draw from multi-agent learning work in a spectrum of areas, including RL, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. We find that this broad view leads to a division of the work into two categories, each with its own special issues: applying a single learner to discover joint solutions to multi-agent problems (team learning), or using multiple simultaneous learners, often one per agent (concurrent learning). Additionally, we discuss direct and indirect communication in connection with learning, plus open issues in task decomposition, scalability, and adaptive dynamics. We conclude with a presentation of multi-agent learning problem domains, and a list of multi-agent learning resources.",,第3页.xls
841,On the decentralized coordination of herding activities: a Jadex-based solution,2010,"The AgentContest 2009 provided a revised Cows and Herders scenario which extended the last year's setting. First, additional environment objects, i.e., fences and switches, were introduced. Secondly, the team score is calculated by the net amount of herded cows at the game end. In this paper we present the design of the multi-agent system (MAS) prototype which participated in this contest and has been developed under usage of the Jadex multi-agent platform. The main focus of our second-time participation was to switch from the centralized coordination architecture of our previous MAS to a decentralized coordination in order to increase the single agents' autonomy. To facilitate the development parts of the Tropos methodology were utilized. These have been extended by platform specific features (e.g. the modularization concept). During the development we were able to identify and eliminate key problems and as a result our prototype could achieve the second place in the contest.",,第3页.xls

844,A Factor-Based Model for Context-Sensitive Skill Rating Systems,2010,"Estimating agent's skill ratings from team competition results has many applications in the real world. Existing models assume skills are the same for all contexts. However, skills are context-sensitive in a variety of cases. In this paper, we present a Factor-Based Context-Sensitive Skill Rating System(FBCS-SRS). Instead of estimating agent skills under every context, which is hard due to data sparisity, we propose a factor model where individual skills are modelled by the inner product of an agent factor vector and a context factor vector. Collapsed Gibbs sampling is used for approximate inference. We formulate the problem of sampling linear constraint factors as a variant of MAX-SAT, and solve it by linear programming algorithms. We validate our model on two real-world datasets. Experiments show that FBCS-SRS achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy than other skill rating systems. The improvement is even more obvious when there are a lot of contexts.",,第3页.xls
845,Serious gaming for building a basis of certification via trust and trustworthiness of autonomous systems,2018,"Autonomous systems governed by a variety of adaptive and nondeterministic algorithms are being planned for inclusion into safety-critical environments, such as unmanned aircraft and space systems in both civilian and military applications. However, until autonomous systems are proven and perceived to be capable and resilient in the face of unanticipated conditions, humans will be reluctant or unable to delegate authority, remaining in control aided by machine-based information and decision support. Proving capability, or trustworthiness, is a necessary component of certification. Perceived capability is a component of trust. Trustworthiness is an attribute of a cyber-physical system that requires context-driven metrics to prove and certify. Trust is an attribute of the agents participating in the system and is gained over time and multiple interactions through trustworthy behavior and transparency. Historically, artificial intelligence and machine learning systems provide answers without explanation - without a rationale or insight into the machine thinking. In order to function as trusted teammates, machines must be able to explain their decisions and actions. This transparency is a product of both content and communication. NASAs Autonomy Teaming & TRAjectories for Complex Trusted Operational Reliability (ATTRACTOR) project seeks to build a basis for certification of autonomous systems via establishing metrics for trustworthiness and trust in multi-agent team interactions, using AI explainability and persistent modeling and simulation, in the context of mission planning and execution, with analyzable trajectories. Inspired by Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) and Serious Gaming, the proposed ATTRACTOR modeling and simulation environment is similar to online gaming environments in which player (aka agent) participants interact with each other, affect their environment, and expect the simulation to persist and change regardless of any individual agents active participation. This persistent simulation environment will accommodate individual agents, groups of self-organizing agents, and large-scale infrastructure behavior. The effects of the emerging adaptation and coevolution can be observed and measured to building a basis of measurable trustworthiness and trust, toward certification of safety-critical autonomous systems.",,第3页.xls

Supply Chain study is adopted more and more for the companies' competitiveness development. Our industrial partner FADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company) handles a logistic flows demonstrator for crisis management, developed by our research team. Indeed, in previous works we proposed an approach, based on interactive autonomous entities. A Multi-Agent architecture is then planned to design a distributed supply chain through interactive software agents. In this paper, we focus on the disturbed mode of the supply chain so we propose to adopt an advanced interaction form between the autonomous entities. Therefore, we propose a new form of negotiation to avoid, in a crisis situation, the stock-out by balancing the resources provisions throughout the system. Simulation results prove the pertinence of the proposed solution.",,第3页.xls
847,A linearly quasi-anticipatory autonomous agent architecture: some preliminary experiments,1996,"This report presents some initial results from simulations of a linear quasi-anticipatory autonomous agent architecture (ALQAAA), which correspond to a special case of a previously suggested general architecture of anticipatory agents. It integrates low-level reaction with high-level deliberation by embedding an ordinary reactive system based on situation-action rules, called the Reactor, in an anticipatory agent forming a layered hybrid architecture. By treating all agents in the domain (itself included) as reactive agents, this approach drastically reduces the amount of search needed while at the same time requiring only a small amount of heuristic domain knowledge. Instead it relies on a linear anticipation mechanism, carried out by the Anticipator, to achieve complex behaviours. The Anticipator uses a world model (in which the agent is represented only by the Reactor) to make a sequence of one-step predictions. After each step it checks whether the simulated Reactor has reached an undesired state. If this is the case it will modify the actual Reactor in order to avoid this state in the future. Results from both single- and multi-agent simulations indicate that the behaviour of ALQAAA agents is superior to that of the corresponding reactive agents. Some promising results on cooperation and coordination of teams of agents are also presented. In particular, the linear anticipation mechanism is successfully used for conflict detection.",,第3页.xls
848,Multi-Agent Task Environment Framework to Support Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization,2013,"The multidisciplinary design and optimization process of products can be supported by automation of analysis and optimization steps. A design and engineering engine is a useful concept to structure this automation. Various discipline analysis tools analyze the particular instantiation of this product model, and an optimizer (or search engine) provides a strategy to drive the design toward a desired design, that is, compliant with required performance, a desired product behavior, or one that is desired by a (human) designer or design team. To power and orchestrate communication of the automatic analysis in this multidisciplinary design and optimization setting, an agent-based framework called TeamMate has been developed and implemented in a design and engineering engine for design and analysis of a vertical tail of an airliner. To facilitate further development of the agent-based framework, an analysis of the problem domain is performed, and a use case is discussed and reflected with literature. From findings, a new set of requirements is proposed for future framework development. Conclusively, several ideas for the next release of the agent-based framework are described. The main contributions of this article are 1) the concept of scope levels for the multidisciplinary design and optimization problem domain, 2) the definition of actor roles in a hybrid (human-computer) multifunctional team to solve the multidisciplinary design and optimization problem domain, 3) the concept of engineering services and engineering service specialist actors being directly responsible for it, 4) the concept of a multi-agent task environment framework to motor the multidisciplinary design and optimization problem-solving environment of the design and engineering engine, and 5) the lessons learned using the multi-agent task environment framework with suggestions for further work.",,第3页.xls
849,Modelling and simulation of the task scheduling behavior in collaborative product development process,2013,"Collaborative Product Development (CPD) process is characterized by autonomous task control, dynamic task sequence, and frequent team collaboration, which endow the process with high flexibility and uncertainty. To make the process predictable and improve process efficiency, it is essential to model, simulate, and analyze the process by considering all these characteristics. As most CPD models are developed to simulate task structures and task-flow process, our work focuses on studying the human working behaviors in CPD process by agent-based simulation, which we think is the main source of process uncertainty and flexibility. In this paper, the local task scheduling behavior of designer agents and the resource conflict resolution behavior of the manager agent are studied under the framework of agent-based simulation. In the simulation, the designer agent schedules his local tasks according to his personal priority, and the manager agent resolves resource conflicts according to collective utility function. To make the process more efficient, a collective utility function is developed for the manager agent, in which task priority, spare resource, and waiting time are considered simultaneously. To validate the effectiveness of the collective utility, simulation experiments are designed and carried out among entire-waiting utility, entire-replacement utility, and collective utility strategy. The simulation results indicate that the proposed utility strategy can effectively shorten the project total time and cost of the case. There are two engineering applications of this approach. First, by simulating and evaluating different task scheduling and resource conflict resolution behaviors of the agents, designers and managers can adopt suitable scheduling strategies at the planning stage of the CPD project. Second, in the executing process of the CPD project, the proposed scheduling priority and utility functions can be used in the dynamic scheduling by developing software agents in the CPD management systems.",,第3页.xls
850,A platform for dynamic organization of agents in agent-based systems,2004,"In most agent-based systems, different middle agents are employed to increase their flexibility. However, there are still three issues remain unsolved: In centralized architecture with single middle agent, the middle agent itself is a bottleneck and suffers from single point failure; Middle agents in distributed architecture lack capability of dynamic organization of agents; The reliability is not strong because of the single point failure and lack of effective architecture. In this paper, we introduce a platform with ring architectural model to solve all above problems. In the platform, multiple middle agents are dynamically supported for solving the first problem. For solving the second problem, middle agents dynamically manage the registration and cancellation of service provider agents and application teams, each of which includes a set of closely interacting requester agents to complete an independent task. Redundancy middle agent technique is proposed for solving the third problem. All middle agents are of the feature of proliferation and self-cancellation according to the sensory inputs from their environment. For organizing the middle agents effectively, a ring architectural model is proposed We demonstrate the applicability of the platform by its application and present experimental evidence that the platform is flexible and robust.",,第3页.xls

852,Why Robots Failed:Demonstrating the Superiority of Multiple-order Trading Agents in Experimental Human-agent Financial Markets,2015,"In the past decade there has been a rapid growth of the use of adaptive automated trading systems, commonly referred to in the finance industry as robot traders: AI applications replacing highly-paid human traders in the global financial markets. The academic roots of this industry-changing deployment of AI technologies can be traced back to research published by a team of researchers at IBM at IJCAI 2001, which was subsequently replicated and extended by De Luca and Cliff at IJCAI 2011 and ICAART 2011. Here, we focus on the order management policy enforced by Open Exchange (OpEx), the open source algorithmic trading system designed by De Luca, for both human and robot traders: while humans are allowed to manage multiple orders simultaneously, robots only deal with one order at the time. We hypothesise that such unbalance may have strongly influenced the victory of human traders over robot traders, reported in past studies by De Luca et al., and by Cartlidge and Cliff. We employed OpEx to implement a multiple-order policy for robots as well as humans, and ran several human vs. robot trading experiments. Using aggregated market metrics and time analysis, we reached two important conclusions. First, we demonstrated that, in mixed human-robot markets, robots dealing multiple simultaneous orders consistently outperform robots dealing one order at a time. And second, we showed that while human traders outperform single-order robot traders under specific circumstances, multiple-order robot traders are never outperformed by human traders. We thus conclude that the performance of robot traders in a human-robot mixed market is strongly influenced by the order management policy they employ.",,第3页.xls
853,Socially conscious decision-making,2003,"For individually motivated agents to work collaboratively to satisfy shared goals, they must make decisions about actions and intentions that take into account their commitments to group activities. This paper examines the role of social consciousness in the process of reconciling intentions to do group-related actions with other, conflicting intentions. We operationalize the notion of social consciousness and provide a first attempt to formally add social consciousness to a cooperative decision-making model. We define a measure of social consciousness; describe its incorporation into the SPIRE experimental system, a simulation environment that allows the process of intention reconciliation in team contexts to be studied; and present results of several experiments that investigate the interaction in decision-making of measures of group and individual good. In particular, we investigate the effect of varying levels of social consciousness on the utility of the group and the individuals it comprises. A key finding is that an intermediate level of social consciousness yields better results in certain circumstances than an extreme commitment. We suggest preliminary principles for designers of collaborative agents based on the results.",,第3页.xls
854,SimKnowledge-Analyzing impact of knowledge management measures on team organizations with multi agent-based simulation,2011,"Even though there is abundant literature on successful cases of organizations applying knowledge management (KM) measures, many KM initiatives have failed to achieve their knowledge and business goals. In order to foster decisions about the design of such initiatives, information is required on success factors and barriers when selecting KM measures. Multi agent-based simulation (MABS) is suggested as instrument to investigate potential effects of KM measures on dependent variables such as sharing of knowledge in organizations or business performance. For such a simulation, the concept of knowledge sharing, influencing factors and their impact on business and knowledge goals are modeled based on an extensive multi-disciplinary literature survey. An extensive domain model is operationalized in a simulation model which is then further simplified and implemented in a MABS tool used for a series of experiments contrasting results with/without KM measures, specifically skill and experience management. Skill management is found highly sensitive with respect to conditions of application and has no significant impact on knowledge or business goals. Experience management positively impacts knowledge and business goals. Personal documentation leads to specialist, project debriefings to generalist knowledge workers. Finally, the paper discusses the simulation's limitations and further areas of application.",,第3页.xls
855,Preliminary Guidelines for Human-Agent Teams in Space Operations Beyond Low-Earth Orbit,2018,"This paper presents preliminary guidelines for function allocation in human-agent teams in space missions beyond Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The current space missions in LEO are supported by real-time collaboration between the space crew and a mission control to deal with any off-nominal situations. For the space missions beyond LEO, the communication delay between an Earth-based mission control and the space crew will limit the guidance a mission control can provide during off-nominal situations, where no procedure exists. This will require that the space crew must detect, diagnose and generate alternative solutions without the real-time support of mission control during the decision-making process. The previous experiences and the training of the space crew may not have anticipated every situation. The generation of new procedures or modification of existing procedures will be a very challenging and time-consuming tasks for the space crew. Therefore, missions beyond LEO will increasingly rely on intelligent automation capabilities to support the space crew's decision-making in real-time. In previous work, the authors generated the domain knowledge models, described the design requirements, and identified the possible concept of future operations. In this paper, a Decision-Action Diagram (DAD) of missions in LEO has been extrapolated to missions beyond LEO. This DAD describes the envisioned collaborative decision-making process of missions beyond LEO for off-nominal situations. The comparison between the DAD of missions beyond LEO and the DAD of current missions in LEO shows that some of the functions performed by mission control would be allocated to a Cognitive Assistant (CA) (intelligent automation) of the space crew in the space vehicle. To allocate functions properly, preliminary guidelines are described to determine: (a) which functions could potentially be allocated to the human or an agent, (b) the potential triggers of the current situation that would determine when functions are dynamically allocated, and (c) the level of automation logic of the CA for each allocated function.",,第3页.xls
856,Adaptive Web Services Monitoring in Cloud Environments,2013,"Cloud computing environments provide flexible infrastructures for third-party management of organizations information technology (IT) assets. With web services being a standard for realizing web-based business capabilities, the emergence of cloud computing will bring new challenges to different web service activities. In this paper, the authors propose an agent-based framework that employs a team of management and monitoring agents on different scopes to provides effective service management in a cloud environment. To tackle the dynamism in service operations, an adaptive monitoring algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is inspired by the congestion control approach from the TCP protocol and provides efficient, up-to-date information about service status without exhaustive monitoring. Experimental results show that the monitoring algorithm provides significant benefits when compared to the more exhaustive methods. This approach also facilitates other service activities, such as cross cloud service discovery.",,第3页.xls
857,Macroscopic modeling of aggregation experiments using embodied agents in teams of constant and time-varying sizes,2004,"In this paper, we present discrete-time, nonspatial, macroscopic models able to capture the dynamics of collective aggregation experiments using groups of embodied agents endowed with reactive controllers. The strength of the proposed models is that they have been built up incrementally, with matching between models and embodied simulations verified at each step as new complexity was added. Precise heuristic criteria based on geometrical considerations and systematic tests with one or two embodied agents prevent the introduction of free parameters into the models. The collective aggregation experiments presented in this paper are concerned with the gathering and clustering of small objects initially scattered in an enclosed arena. Experiments were carried out with teams consisting of one to ten individuals, using groups of both constant and time-varying sizes. In the latter case, the number of active workers was controlled by a simple, fully distributed, threshold-based algorithm whose aim was to allocate an appropriate number of individuals to a time-evolving aggregation demand. To this purpose, agents exclusively used their local perception to estimate the availability of work. Results show that models can deliver both qualitatively and quantitatively correct predictions and they represent a useful tool for generalizing the dynamics of these highly stochastic, asynchronous, nonlinear systems, often outperforming intuitive reasoning. Finally, in addition to discussions of small prediction discrepancies and difficulties in generating quantitatively correct macroscopic models, we conclude the paper by reviewing the intrinsic limitations of the current modeling methodology and by proposing a few suggestions for future work.",,第3页.xls
858,The role of trust in distributed design,2004,"Automated support of design teams, consisting of both human and automated systems, requires an understanding of the role of trust in distributed design processes. By explicating trust, an individual designer's decisions become better understood and may be better supported. Each individual designer has his or her private goals in a cooperative design setting, in which requirement conflicts and resource competitions abound. However, there are group goals that also need to be reached. This paper presents an overview of research related to trust in the context of agents and design, a computational knowledge-level model of trust based on the seven beliefs distinguished by Castelfranchi and Falcone, and an example of the use of the trust model in a specific design process, namely, Website design from the perspective of a single designer. The results are discussed in the context of distributed design in open systems.",,第3页.xls
859,"On Cooperative Patrolling: Optimal Trajectories, Complexity Analysis, and Approximation Algorithms",2012,"The subject of this paper is the patrolling of an environment with the aid of a team of autonomous agents. We consider both the design of open-loop trajectories with optimal properties and of distributed control laws converging to optimal trajectories. As performance criteria, the refresh time and the latency are considered, i.e., respectively, time gap between any two visits of the same region and the time necessary to inform every agent about an event occurred in the environment. We associate a graph with the environment, and we study separately the case of a chain, tree, and cyclic graph. For the case of chain graph, we first describe a minimum refresh time and latency team trajectory and propose a polynomial time algorithm for its computation. Then, we describe a distributed procedure that steers the robots toward an optimal trajectory. For the case of tree graph, a polynomial time algorithm is developed for the minimum refresh time problem, under the technical assumption of a constant number of robots involved in the patrolling task. Finally, we show that the design of a minimum refresh time trajectory for a cyclic graph is NP-hard, and we develop a constant factor approximation algorithm.",,第3页.xls
860,Adaptive behavior for cooperation: A virtual reality application,1999,"In this paper, we present a behavioral system based on artificial life for animating actors in a virtual reality application. Trough a virtual soccer game, we show how a set of autonomous players (called agents) can cooperate and communicate to perform common tasks. The user is immersed in the game. He interacts with the other agents and he is integrated in the cooperation and in the communication systems. Every entity reacts in real-time by using a classifiers system which is composed of a set of binary rules and a reward system. The originality of such method is the ability to build a behavior (by emergence) without initial knowledge. The analysis of the simulation gives interesting results-after convergence, the global behavior of the teams produces coherent movements.

To realize effective knowledge sharing in teamwork, knowledge sharing relationships among agents were analyzed. Cooperation willingness of knowledge sharing among agents was studied. Based on social network analysis technology, an optimization approach was proposed for more effective knowledge flows planning. With resource constraint, task allocation was optimized according to its network features in knowledge flow network so as to improve knowledge flow efficiency for workflow nodes.",,第3页.xls
862,Preparing for Emergency Situations,2010,"Disaster relief can be seen as a dynamic multi actor process with actors both joining and leaving the relief work during the help and rescue phase after the disaster has occurred. Actors may be governmental agencies, non profit voluntary organisations or spontaneous helpers comprised of individual citizens or temporal groups of citizens. Hence, they will vary widely in agility, competence, resources, and endurance. To prepare for for disasters a net based Agora with simulation of emergency situations for mutual preparation, training, and organisational learning is suggested. Such an Agora will ensure future security by: -Rising awareness and preparedness of potential disaster responders by help of the components and resources in the netAgora environment; -Improving cooperation and coordination between responders; -Improving competence and performance of organisations involved in security issues; -Bridging cultural differences between responders from different organizations and different backgrounds. The developed models are intended to reflect intelligent anticipatory systems for human operator anticipation of future consequences. As a way to catch what should be included in this netbased Agora and to join the split pictures that is present, Team Syntegrity could be a helpful tool. The purpose of Team Syntegrity is to stimulate collaboration and incite cross fertilization and creativity. The difference between syntegration and other group work is that the participants are evenly and uniquely distributed and will collectively have the means, the knowledge, the experience, the perspectives, and the expertise, to deal with the topic. In this paper the possibilities with using Team Syntegrity in preparation for the development of a netbased Agora is discussed. We have identified that Team Syntegrity could be useful in the steps User Integration, Designing the netAgora environment, developing Test Scenarios, and assessment of netAgora environment.",,第3页.xls
863,Using agents to detect opportunities for collaboration,2006,"Dissemination of Internet and networking technologies have brought about an increase in adoption of remote work groups, with teams working in non-collocated environments. In this new scenario, contact with colleagues and discovery of opportunities for interaction and collaboration, previously easy due to physical proximity, becomes harder. In this paper, we describe an agent-based framework to assist users in finding opportunities for interaction that may have been overlooked. While many similar approaches have been proposed to provide matchmaking services, they rely on historic data and bring users together based on interests. In our approach, we utilize ongoing work context to produce matches that fit each user's needs. In this way, we aim to provide awareness information about other users current work, enabling individuals to become aware of what is happening in the surrounding environment.",,第3页.xls
864,Towards an Agent-Based Methodology for Developing Agro-Ecosystem Simulations,2011,"Agro-ecosystems are ecological systems subject to human interaction whose simulation is of interest to several disciplines (e.g. agronomy, ecology and sociology). The agent-based modeling approach appears as a suitable tool for modeling this kind of complex system, along with a corresponding agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) methodology for the construction of the simulation. Nevertheless, existing AOSE methodologies are general-purpose, have not yet accomplished widespread use, and clear examples of applications to agro-ecosystems are hard to find. This article sets the ground for an AOSE methodology devised specifically for developing agro-ecosystem simulations. The methodology framework is based upon other general-purpose AOSE methodologies, and it relies on the Unified Modeling Language for an easy uptake from interdisciplinary teams. As a first proof of concept, it is applied to a real case study: the evolution of the strategies followed by cattle producers of the basalt-region of north Uruguay against severe draughts.",,第3页.xls

Widely used approach in the robotic community is frontier based exploration. We combine this technique with a multi-agent architecture A-globe, which allows solving the exploration problem with limited communication accessibility and with changing number of participating robots. Frontier based approach heavily depends on path planning algorithm. A novel method combining A* search with harmonic potential fields is also presented. Finally, the Iterative Closest Point localization algorithm has been improved in several ways, in order to increase its speed and robustness. The whole exploration framework has been implemented and tested in both simulated and real environments.",,第3页.xls

Realizing open data's promise of innovation and entrepreneurialism requires the support of diverse stakeholders. Government agencies must release accessible and useful data; developers must use the data to build tools; and citizens must adopt the technology.The interests of one group may come at the expense of another. For this reason, we examine the usefulness of a diplomatic design approach, which focuses on the art and practice of conducting negotiations using specialized techniques. We conducted an exploratory case study on a national nonprofit fellowship program as it worked to design not only technology but also organizational and social change in the context of a digital government engagement.",,第3页.xls
867,ARMS Collaborator - intelligent agents using markets to organise resourcing in modern enterprises,2003,"An efficient deployment of the BT workforce in response to the dynamic nature of customer requests for services is crucial to BT's ability to compete in the ever-competitive telecommunications markets. The Automated Resource Management System ( ARMS) is being developed to tackle this challenging problem. Its aim is to efficiently utilise the BT workforce by intelligently assigning engineers in line with forecast and real jobs. ARMS has three major functional components - Forecasting and Job Generation (FJG), Dynamic Planner (DP) and Collaborator.This paper is based on Collaborator - a computer system responsible for monitoring and supporting resource re-distribution decision-making in BT's operational resource management units. Collaborator enhances the deployment process by allowing dynamic re-distribution of engineers among a group of customer service teams (CSTs) so that resource utilisation is improved. Collaborator focuses on balancing the workforce across multiple patches. Collaborator is formulated as a multi-agent coordination problem. Various software agents support the manager's decision-making process. BT aims to further optimise resource deployment by using this novel approach, and ultimately to substantially reduce its operational costs.",,第3页.xls
868,Coalition Formation for Multi-agent Pursuit Based on Neural Network,2019,"Multi-agent Systems (MAS) often needs to pursue a common goal and in order to achieve that they need to make an effective formation. An approach for coalition formation of multi-agent pursuit based on neural network (NN) and agent group role membership function (AGRMF) model is proposed and thus making a novel algorithm called ARGMF-NN. This new algorithm consists of two parts i.e. feature extraction and group generation. First, the layers of feature extraction can abstract the AGRMF feature for all of the groups. Secondly, those features will be fed to the group generation part based on self-organizing map (SOM) layer which is used to group the pursuers with similar features. Besides, we also come up with the group attractiveness function(GAF) which is used to evaluate the quality of coalitions and the pursuers contribution. It helps in adjusting the main ability indicators of AGRMF and other weights of the whole neural network. The simulation experiment showed that this proposal can improve the effectiveness of coalition formation for multi-agent pursuit and also the ability to adopt pursuit-evasion problem with the scale of growing pursuer team.",,第3页.xls

Further, we consider the problem of selecting a subset of followers to connect with leader for yielding fastest converging controlled consensus which can be cast as a convex optimization problem.",,第3页.xls
870,Interactive integration of information agents on the Web,2001,"World Wide Web contains a vast amount of different information stored in a huge number of distributed Web sites. Search engines and information agents have been developed to facilitate efficient information retrieval tasks from the Web. By integrating multiple search engines and information agents as an interoperable system, we increase the value of each of them. In conventional collaborative systems, the integration process is designed by system designers and is concealed from the end users.This paper proposes an interactive multiagent-based interface called Multiple Character-agent Interface (MCI) where animated character-agents interact with each other and with the user for assisting in information retrieval. By using the MCI, even a novice user can create a team of information agents and can self-customize the agents through the interactions with them. We here report the architecture of MCI and two prototype systems based on MCI, Venus and Mars, which is a cooperative multiagent system for information retrieval, and Recommendation Battlers, which is a competitive multiagent system for information recommendation.",,第3页.xls
871,Congregation formation in multiagent systems,2003,"We present congregating both as a metaphor for describing and modeling multiagent systems (MAS) and as a means for reducing coordination costs in large-scale MAS. When agents must search for other agents to interact with, congregations provide a way for agents to bias this search towards groups of agents that have tended to produce successful interactions in the past. This causes each agent's search problem to scale with the size of a congregation rather than the size of the population as a whole. In this paper, we present a formal model of a congregation and then apply Vidal and Durfee's CLRI framework [24] to the congregating problem. We apply congregating to the affinity group domain, and show that if agents are unable to describe congregations to each other, the problem of forming optimal congregations grows exponentially with the number of agents. The introduction of labelers provides a means of coordinating agent decisions, thereby reducing the problem's complexity. We then show how a structured label space can be exploited to simplify the labeler's decision problem and make the congregating problem linear in the number of labels. We then present experimental evidence demonstrating how congregating can be used to reduce agents' search costs, thereby allowing the system to scale up. We conclude with a comparison to other methods for coordinating multiagent behavior, particularly teams and coalitions.",,第3页.xls

The configuration of the environment, namely the robots relative positions depending on both the global task and the game dynamics, provides a source of implicit information about the robots intention to be involved in collective actions, making them able to cooperate implicitly. The soccer team performance can be tuned by triggering the arbitration module of any single robot to generate, as many as possible, suitable situations which hint to the team the action of scoring the goal. Some macroscopic parameters can be usefully introduced to evaluate the evolution of the whole multi-robot software system.",,第3页.xls
873,Levels of explainable artificial intelligence for human-aligned conversational explanations,2021,"Over the last few years there has been rapid research growth into eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and the closely aligned Interpretable Machine Learning (IML). Drivers for this growth include recent legislative changes and increased investments by industry and governments, along with increased concern from the general public. People are affected by autonomous decisions every day and the public need to understand the decision-making process to accept the outcomes. However, the vast majority of the applications of XAI/IML are focused on providing low-level 'narrow' explanations of how an individual decision was reached based on a particular datum. While important, these explanations rarely provide insights into an agent's: beliefs and motivations; hypotheses of other (human, animal or AI) agents' intentions; interpretation of external cultural expectations; or, processes used to generate its own explanation. Yet all of these factors, we propose, are essential to providing the explanatory depth that people require to accept and trust the AI's decision-making. This paper aims to define levels of explanation and describe how they can be integrated to create a human-aligned conversational explanation system. In so doing, this paper will survey current approaches and discuss the integration of different technologies to achieve these levels with Broad eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (Broad-XAI), and thereby move towards high-level 'strong' explanations.

874,A Mixed Reality Approach for Innovative Pair Programming Education with a Conversational AI Virtual Avatar,2023,"yPair Programming (PP) is an Agile software development methodology that involves two developers working together on a single computer. However, the physical presence of two developers has become a challenge in recent years due to the pandemic, necessitating remote collaboration methods such as Distributed Pair Programming (DPP). DPP has been found to have similar benefits to in-person PP, but the issue of team compatibility remains unresolved. These are more evident in the educational field of Agile methodologies. To address these challenges, we developed a novel approach by creating a Mixed Reality (MR) application that enables users to learn PP with the assistance of a conversational intelligent virtual avatar. The application uses the HoloLens MR device and a Conversational Agent (CA) extension integrated into Visual Studio Code to provide suggestions for improving the code written by the user. The virtual avatar animates these suggestions, making it appear to speak and interact with the user in real time. This system aims to overcome the limitations of common DPP methods, allowing a single developer to learn and apply the PP methodology even when a human partner is unavailable.",,第3页.xls
875,A software system for identification of a harmonization degree of creative decisions of intellectual agents,2017,"The article considers an information system for determining a degree of harmonization of creative solutions of intellectual agents. According to the general approach to intelligent multi-agent systems and their purpose, the paper considers interaction between agents when they solve a certain creative task. All creative tasks are complex tasks with information reporting and manipulation algorithms. At the final stage they assume coordination and adaptation procedures taking into account changing external and internal conditions of system functioning and implementation of a solution. The purpose of the study is to identify the most effective agents in solving a problem. It is undeniable that an agent can be effective itself. However, in a team it reduces its effectiveness. Conversely, working in a team helps to increase the agents activity, operational efficiency. All agents of the system are equal. The efficiency of each of them is estimated by the same method. Each agent offers its solution of the task. These solutions are compared by harmony. If the level of harmony corresponds to a given one, then such multi-agent system is effective. All agents act together, for the benefit of a common goal, reach it with a given quality or above. Otherwise, a system structure and composition are reviewed. The main goal in this case is finding the composition and structure of the multi-agent system when actions between the agents are the most coordinated, that ensures solving the indicated problems. According to the results of the research, due to intelligence of the agents, they tend to change their psycho-behavioral type depending on time they spend on solving a task. As a rule, increasing a time interval leads to changing a compromise type to deviating or coercive. In other words, agents are characterized by a transition from an optimistic attitude to pessimistic (depressive). To prevent such transitions and mood changes, there are certain control actions taking into account the need for an individual approach to each individual agent.",,第3页.xls
876,Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for Multi-Agent Intelligence [arXiv],2019,"Learning agents that are not only capable of taking tests but are also innovating are becoming a hot topic in artificial intelligence (AI). One of the most promising paths towards this vision is multi-agent learning, where agents act as the environment for each other, and improving each agent means proposing new problems for others. However, the existing evaluation platforms are either not compatible with multi-agent settings, or limited to a specific game. That is, there is not yet a general evaluation platform for research on multi-agent intelligence. To this end, we introduce Arena, a general evaluation platform for multi-agent intelligence with 35 games of diverse logic and representations. Furthermore, multi-agent intelligence is still at the stage where many problems remain unexplored. Therefore, we provide a building toolkit for researchers to easily invent and build novel multi-agent problems from the provided games set based on a GUI-configurable social tree and five basic multi-agent reward schemes. Finally, we provide python implementations of five state-of-the-art deep multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines. Along with the baseline implementations, we release a set of 100 best agents/teams that we can train with different training schemes for each game, as the base for evaluating agents with population performance. As such, the research community can perform comparisons under a stable and uniform standard. Code for the games, building toolkit and baselines are released at https://github.com/YuhangSong/Arena-BuildingToolkit and https://github.com/YuhangSong/Arena-Baselines.",,第3页.xls
877,Time for a full digital approach in nephropathology: a systematic review of current artificial intelligence applications and future directions,2024,"IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) integration in nephropathology has been growing rapidly in recent years, facing several challenges including the wide range of histological techniques used, the low occurrence of certain diseases, and the need for data sharing. This narrative review retraces the history of AI in nephropathology and provides insights into potential future developments.MethodsElectronic searches in PubMed-MEDLINE and Embase were made to extract pertinent articles from the literature. Works about automated image analysis or the application of an AI algorithm on non-neoplastic kidney histological samples were included and analyzed to extract information such as publication year, AI task, and learning type. Prepublication servers and reviews were not included.ResultsSeventy-six (76) original research articles were selected. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States in the last 7 years. To date, research has been mainly conducted on relatively easy tasks, like single-stain glomerular segmentation. However, there is a trend towards developing more complex tasks such as glomerular multi-stain classification.ConclusionDeep learning has been used to identify patterns in complex histopathology data and looks promising for the comprehensive assessment of renal biopsy, through the use of multiple stains and virtual staining techniques. Hybrid and collaborative learning approaches have also been explored to utilize large amounts of unlabeled data. A diverse team of experts, including nephropathologists, computer scientists, and clinicians, is crucial for the development of AI systems for nephropathology.

878,Soldier-led Adaptation of Autonomous Agents (SLA3),2021,"Current paradigms for collecting data to train fieldable computer vision (CV) algorithms are inefficient and expensive in terms of time and resources, and they have limited ability to adapt to changing target signatures. By leveraging opportunistic sensing of the operator's natural behavior (e.g., firing a weapon, placing markers on a map), it is possible to triage the data for CV algorithms. When paired with an After Action Review (AAR) to confirm target presence and location, the resulting pipeline can efficiently update the CV for changing target signatures. Subjects (n = 10) participated in a simulated mission in which they were asked to mark video frames in which targets belonging to three classes first appeared, then perform a brief AAR in which they were asked to mark target locations in these frames. The CV (Detectron2) was initially trained on one target class, then retrained on instances of a novel class acquired by this pipeline. We report that retraining the CV on as few as 8 images resulted in good localization performance (AP(50) 85.6, AR 42.5) on unseen test images to this novel class. Ten minutes of retraining (600 iterations) was sufficient for good performance (AP(50) 58.3, AR 27.5). Data augmentation via random occlusions and apertures ('bubbling') boosted the training set 192-fold and improved the ratio of hits to false alarms and improved resilience to naturalistic occlusion and small sizes (AP 80-100 and AR 80). These results support our approach as an efficient method to adapt CV via partially labeled operational data.",,第3页.xls
879,A Digital Design Agent for Ground Vehicles,2024,"The design of transportation vehicles, whether passenger or commercial, typically involves a lengthy process from concept to prototype and eventual manufacture. To improve competitiveness, original equipment manufacturers are continually exploring ways to shorten the design process. The application of digital tools such as computer-aided-design and computer-aided-engineering, as well as model-based computer simulation enable team members to virtually design and evaluate ideas within realistic operating environments. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) can be integrated into this paradigm to shorten the initial design sequence through the creation of digital agents. A digital agent can intelligently explore the design space to identify promising component features which can be collectively assessed within a virtual vehicle simulation. In this paper, the framework for a python-based ML/AI virtual agent will be presented and applied to a vehicle suspension within an off-road ground vehicle. A case study investigates four suspension designs and their corresponding component feature characteristics with attention focused on ride quality, weight, and maximum force. Representative results are presented and discussed to offer insight into the methodology and briefly contrast it with traditional optimization approaches. The path forward for the inclusion of multiple design agents within a collaborative digital design bowl are presented in the conclusion.",,第3页.xls
880,MAS2CAR ARCHITECTURE Multi-agent System to Control and Coordinate teAmworking Robots,2011,"This paper aims to present the Multi-Agent System to Control and Coordinate teAmworking Robots (MAS2CAR), a new architecture to control a group of coordinated autonomous robots in unstructured environments. MAS2CAR covers two main layers: (i) the Control Layer and we focus on (ii) the Coordination Layer. The control module is responsible for a part of the decision making process while taking into account robot's structural constraints. Despite this autonomy possibility, the Coordination Layer manages the robots in order to bring cooperative behavior and to allow team-work. In this paper we present a scenario validating our approach based upon the multi-agent systems (MAS). Thanks to its reliability we have chosen the M OISEInst organizational model and we will present how it can be used for this use-case. Moreover, regarding to the implementation part, we have retained U TOPIA, a framework which automatically build a MAS thanks to a M OISEInst specification.",,第3页.xls
881,Evolving agent-based simulations in the clouds,2010,"Evolving agent-based simulations enables one to automate the difficult iterative process of modeling complex adaptive systems to exhibit pre-specified/desired behaviors. Nevertheless this emerging technology, combining research advances in agent-based modeling/simulation and evolutionary computation, requires significant computing resources (i.e., high performance computing facilities) to evaluate simulation models across a large search space. Moreover, such experiments are typically conducted in an infrequent fashion and may occur when the computing facilities are not fully available. The user may thus be confronted with a computing budget limiting the use of these evolvable simulation techniques. We propose the use of the cloud computing paradigm to address these budget and flexibility issues. To assist this research, we utilize a modular evolutionary framework coined CASE (for complex adaptive system evolver) which is capable of evolving agent-based models using nature-inspired search algorithms. In this paper, we present an adaptation of this framework which supports the cloud computing paradigm. An example evolutionary experiment, which examines a simplified military scenario modeled with the agent-based simulation platform MANA, is presented. This experiment refers to Automated Red Teaming: a vulnerability assessment tool employed by defense analysts to study combat operations (which are regarded here as complex adaptive systems). The experimental results suggest promising research potential in exploiting the cloud computing paradigm to support computing intensive evolvable simulation experiments. Finally, we discuss an additional extension to our cloud computing compliant CASE in which we propose to incorporate a distributed evolutionary approach, e.g., the island-based model to further optimize the evolutionary search.",,第3页.xls
882,Cooperation in Human-Agent Systems to Support Resilience: A Microworld Experiment,2016,"Objective: This study uses a dyadic approach to understand human-agent cooperation and system resilience.Background: Increasingly capable technology fundamentally changes human-machine relationships. Rather than reliance on or compliance with more or less reliable automation, we investigate interaction strategies with more or less cooperative agents.Method: A joint-task microworld scenario was developed to explore the effects of agent cooperation on participant cooperation and system resilience. To assess the effects of agent cooperation on participant cooperation, 36 people coordinated with a more or less cooperative agent by requesting resources and responding to requests for resources in a dynamic task environment. Another 36 people were recruited to assess effects following a perturbation in their own hospital.Results: Experiment 1 shows people reciprocated the cooperative behaviors of the agents; a low-cooperation agent led to less effective interactions and less resource sharing, whereas a high-cooperation agent led to more effective interactions and greater resource sharing. Experiment 2 shows that an initial fast-tempo perturbation undermined proactive cooperationpeople tended to not request resources. However, the initial fast tempo had little effect on reactive cooperationpeople tended to accept resource requests according to cooperation level.Conclusion: This study complements the supervisory control perspective of human-automation interaction by considering interdependence and cooperation rather than the more common focus on reliability and reliance.Application: The cooperativeness of automated agents can influence the cooperativeness of human agents. Design and evaluation for resilience in teams involving increasingly autonomous agents should consider the cooperative behaviors of these agents.",,第3页.xls
883,A New Distributed Coverage Algorithm Based on Hexagonal Formation,2009,"A distributed coverage algorithm for a team of robots based on a hexagonal formation is presented in this paper for complete coverage of free space. The main property of hexagonal formation is the high fault tolerance due to the overlap coverage of the three agents in each direction. Moreover, a coverage degree of 3 is also guaranteed for almost all points of the area.Another important feature of the proposed approach is that it does not require the absolute positions of the agents. The formed cluster is then considered as a single robot; hence, the coverage algorithm developed for a single robot can be extended to solve the resulting coverage problem. A common objective, especially in a deterministic node deployment, is to use a minimum number of nodes (sensors). In this approach, however, the maximum coverage is guaranteed for a fixed number of agents.",,第3页.xls
884,Multi-robot coordination using Setplays in the middle-size and simulation leagues,2011,"Strategic planning and multi-agent coordination are major research topics in the domain of RoboCup. Innovations in these areas are, however, often developed and applied to only a single RoboCup league and/or one domain, without proper generalization. Moreover, the more technical leagues, like middle-size and humanoid, tend to focus development on low-level skills, that often suffice to gain a competitive edge over other teams. In these leagues, the development of high-level cooperation is secondary.Although the importance of the concept of Setplay, to structure a robotic soccer team behaviour, has been acknowledged by many researchers, no general framework for the development and execution of generic Setplays has been introduced in the context of RoboCup. This paper presents such a framework for high-level Setplay definition and execution, applicable to any RoboCup cooperative league and similar domains. The framework is based on a flexible, standard and league-independent language, which defines Setplays that are interpreted and executed at run-time, using inter-robot communication.An initial major step in the development of the Setplay framework was its usage and testing in the scope of the FCPortugal team, which participates in the RoboCup 2D-simulation and 3D-simulation leagues, where it won several titles both in the 2D and 3D leagues. This framework was also recently implemented in the middle-size team CAMBADA. This team has, in the recent past and with previous versions of the control software, ranked first and third in RoboCup's 2008 and 2009 editions. The implementation is described with concrete examples of Setplay definition and execution, which shows the usefulness of this approach and motivate its use as a major coordination tool for teams participating in the simulation, small-size, middle-size, standard platform and humanoid leagues of RoboCup.

885,Integration of autonomous UAVs into multi-agent simulation,2012,"In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted much attention both in the research field and in the field of commercial deployment. Researchers recently started to study problems and opportunities connected with the usage, deployment and operation of teams of multiple autonomous UAVs. These multi-UAV scenarios are by their nature well suited to be modelled and simulated as multi-agent systems. In this paper we present solutions to the problems that we had to deal with in the process of integrating two hardware UAVs into an existing multi-agent simulation system with additional virtual UAVs, resulting in a mixed reality system where hardware UAVs and virtual UAVs can co-exist, coordinate their flight and cooperate on common tasks. Hardware UAVs are capable of on-board planning and reasoning, and can cooperate and coordinate their movement with one another, and also with virtual UAVs.",,第3页.xls
886,"Consensus, cooperative learning, and flocking for multiagent predator avoidance",2020,"Multiagent coordination is highly desirable with many uses in a variety of tasks. In nature, the phenomenon of coordinated flocking is highly common with applications related to defending or escaping from predators. In this article, a hybrid multiagent system that integrates consensus, cooperative learning, and flocking control to determine the direction of attacking predators and learns to flock away from them in a coordinated manner is proposed. This system is entirely distributed requiring only communication between neighboring agents. The fusion of consensus and collaborative reinforcement learning allows agents to cooperatively learn in a variety of multiagent coordination tasks, but this article focuses on flocking away from attacking predators. The results of the flocking show that the agents are able to effectively flock to a target without collision with each other or obstacles. Multiple reinforcement learning methods are evaluated for the task with cooperative learning utilizing function approximation for state-space reduction performing the best. The results of the proposed consensus algorithm show that it provides quick and accurate transmission of information between agents in the flock. Simulations are conducted to show and validate the proposed hybrid system in both one and two predator environments, resulting in an efficient cooperative learning behavior. In the future, the system of using consensus to determine the state and reinforcement learning to learn the states can be applied to additional multiagent tasks.",,第3页.xls

889,Multi-agent active perception with prediction rewards [arXiv],2020,"Multi-agent active perception is a task where a team of agents cooperatively gathers observations to compute a joint estimate of a hidden variable. The task is decentralized and the joint estimate can only be computed after the task ends by fusing observations of all agents. The objective is to maximize the accuracy of the estimate. The accuracy is quantified by a centralized prediction reward determined by a centralized decision-maker who perceives the observations gathered by all agents after the task ends. In this paper, we model multi-agent active perception as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) with a convex centralized prediction reward. We prove that by introducing individual prediction actions for each agent, the problem is converted into a standard Dec-POMDP with a decentralized prediction reward. The loss due to decentralization is bounded, and we give a sufficient condition for when it is zero. Our results allow application of any Dec-POMDP solution algorithm to multi-agent active perception problems, and enable planning to reduce uncertainty without explicit computation of joint estimates. We demonstrate the empirical usefulness of our results by applying a standard Dec-POMDP algorithm to multi-agent active perception problems, showing increased scalability in the planning horizon.",,第3页.xls
890,"Evolution, generality and robustness of emerged surrounding behavior in continuous predators-prey pursuit problem",2005,"We present the result of our work on the use of strongly typed genetic programming with exception handling capabilities for the evolution of surrounding behavior of agents situated in an inherently cooperative environment. The predators-prey pursuit problem is used to verify our hypothesis that relatively complex surrounding behavior may emerge from simple, implicit, locally defined, and therefore-scalable interactions between the predator agents. Proposing two different communication mechanisms ((i) simple, basic mechanism of implicit interaction, und (ii) explicit communications among the predator agents) we present a comparative analysis of the implications of these communication mechanisms on evolution, generality and robustness of the emerged surrounding behavior. We demonstrate that relatively complex-surrounding behavior emerges even from implicit, proximity-defined interactions among the agents. Although the basic model offers the benefits of simplicity and scalability, compared to the enhanced model of explicit communications among the agents, it features increased computational effort and inferior generality and robustness of agents' emergent surrounding behavior when the team of predator agents is evolved in noiseless environment and then tested in noisy and uncertain environment. Evolution in noisy environment virtually equalizes the robustness and generality characteristics of both models. For both models however the increase of noise levels during the evolution is associated with evolving solutions, which are more robust to noise but less general to new, unknown initial situations.",,第3页.xls

A disaster scenario is simulated causing buildings to catch fire, roads to get blocked, and civilians to get injured and/or buried. The main goal is to use the available emergency services (rescue agents) to extinguish the fires, clear the roads, and rescue the civilians. This paper describes a new multi-agent planning approach applied to the RoboCup Rescue problem. The key novelty lies in the distributed approach for task allocation and coordination. It is done through clustering the map into several overlapping maps each with a different group of agents assigned to it. Our results showed that not only we could compete against the top teams in the 2011 RoboCup Rescue Agent Simulation Competition, but we ranked 3rd in this first participation of the GUC in the competition.",,第3页.xls
892,An infrastructure for automating information sharing in analytic collaboration,2006,"In many parts of the intelligence community data gathers at rates that preclude the ability of analysts and policy makers to ingest, let alone comprehend, the complex information confronting them without working together in teams. These teams often form ad-hoc, mission-oriented communities of practice, and sometimes larger multi-mission communities of interest. These communities can be distributed across the globe. Within these communities analysts try to share their insights but often end up simply passing around partially processed information. This paper reports on developments toward a next generation collaboration supporting small groups of analysts (or policy makers) engaged in joint analysis and problem solving. The work reported in this paper automates what ought to be automated, differentiating between what machines do well and what humans do well. It describes an infrastructure that automates much of the information exchange between analysts while at the same time creating an environment that facilitates insight sharing among analysts in a community of interest.",,第3页.xls
893,D++: Structural Credit Assignment in Tightly Coupled Multiagent Domains,2016,"Autonomous multi-robot teams can be used in complex coordinated exploration tasks to improve exploration performance in terms of both speed and effectiveness. However, use of multi-robot systems presents additional challenges. Specifically, in domains where the robots' actions are tightly coupled, coordinating multiple robots to achieve cooperative behavior at the group level is difficult. In this paper, we demonstrate that reward shaping can greatly benefit learning in multi-robot exploration tasks. We propose a novel reward framework based on the idea of counterfactuals to tackle the coordination problem in tightly coupled domains. We show that the proposed algorithm provides superior performance (166% performance improvement and a quadruple convergence speed up) compared to policies learned using either the global reward or the difference reward [1].",,第3页.xls

895,Onboarding Bot for Newcomers to Software Engineering,2020,"Software development teams dedicate considerable resources to training newcomers. Newcomers are new developers to a software project. The software onboarding process is more complicated than onboarding into other organizations. It is much more challenging and time-consuming. The role of a mentor in onboarding newcomers in software engineering is well understood. However, the disruptions to the work of an experienced developer can reduce the quality of their work and job satisfaction. We propose a conversational bot that can help onboard newcomers to a software project instead of an experienced programmer. The bot will act as a mentor for the newcomer, thus putting less stress on experienced programmers. The bot will also be able to scan outside sources, such as stack overflow, for solutions to issues a newcomer may face. The newcomer will be able to interact with the bot using natural language. We will use this bot to assess improvements to code quality in future studies.",,第3页.xls
896,Ant algorithms in a graph environment: a meta-scheme for coordination and control,2002,"Ant algorithms already demonstrated their usefulness in today's multi-agent systems. This paper introduces a meta-scheme describing a high-level behavior for ant agents in a graph environment. Application of this meta-scheme makes the ant agents repeatedly visit the nodes in the graph that constitutes their environment. The main focus of the meta-scheme is on its reusability. The meta-scheme is used/extended by filling in the elements that decide about routing and cloning, as well as the retrieval and writing of information on information spaces attached to the nodes of environment. Two sample applications of the meta-scheme are described, called the Flooding Walk Role and Emitting Walk Role respectively. The research team applied these two applications of the meta-scheme to a case for communication networks and a case for manufacturing control. Finally, a conclusion is made on the utilization and the reusability of the proposed meta-scheme.",,第3页.xls
897,Biologically inspired redistribution of a swarm of robots among multiple sites,2008,"We present a biologically inspired approach to the dynamic assignment and re- assignment of a homogeneous swarm of robots to multiple locations, which is relevant to applications like search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and task allocation. Our work is inspired by experimental studies of ant house hunting and empirical models that predict the behavior of the colony that is faced with a choice between multiple candidate nests. We design quorum based stochastic control policies that enable the team of agents to distribute themselves among multiple candidate sites in a specified ratio, and compare our results to the linear stochastic policies described in (Halasz et al., in Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'07), pp. 2320-2325, 2007). We show how our quorum model consistently performs better than the linear models while minimizing computational requirements and now it can be implemented without the use of inter-agent wireless communication.",,第3页.xls
898,Network Decontamination,2019,"The Network Decontamination problem consists of coordinating a team of mobile agents in order to clean a contaminated network. The problem is actually equivalent to tracking and capturing an invisible and arbitrarily fast fugitive. This problem has natural applications in network security in computer science or in robotics for search or pursuit-evasion missions. Many different objectives have been studied: the main one being the minimization of the number of mobile agents necessary to clean a contaminated network. Many environments (continuous or discrete) have also been considered. In this Chapter, we focus on networks modeled by graphs. In this context, the optimization problem that consists of minimizing the number of agents has a deep graph-theoretical interpretation. Network decontamination and, more precisely,graph searchingmodels, provide nice algorithmic interpretations of fundamental concepts in the Graph Minors theory by Robertson and Seymour. For all these reasons, graph searching variants have been widely studied since their introduction by Breish (1967) and mathematical formalizations by Parsons (1978) and Petrov (1982). This chapter consists of an overview of the algorithmic results on graph decontamination and graph searching.",,第3页.xls
899,Building a next-generation infrastructure for agent-based distance learning,2002,"The emergence of the Internet has radically changed the way in which we learn, teach and train. This paper proposes an integrated and extensible architecture for agent-based distance learning. The architecture provides component-based extensibility, allowing emerging technologies to be plugged-in, so that they can produce synergy. It provides HTTP and IIOP connections for maintaining and delivering courseware to students. Via an HTTP connection, the authors' Persona system provides a personalised service to each set of courseware, allowing it to customise its content and/or presentation context-sensitively. This service facilitates the effective delivery of courseware. Via an IIOP connection, their SoftDock system provides a foundation facility allowing users to work collaboratively in teams. Their current educational domain is software modelling. Participants learn the basic concepts and principles of software modelling and then leverage their newly-acquired modelling skills. They believe their work provides a blueprint for showing how emerging technologies can be applied to practical distance learning applications.",,第3页.xls
900,On the state agreement problem for multiple unicycles with varying communication links,2006,"This paper presents a decentralized feedback control strategy that drives a system of multiple nonholonomic kinematic unicycles to agreement. The communication links between the members of the team may change over time and hence the communication topology is dynamic. The case of static communication topology was dealt in the previous work of the authors (2006). The proposed nonholonomic control law is discontinuous and time-invariant and tools from nonsmooth stability theory and matrix theory are used to check the stability of the overall system. Similarly to the linear case, the convergence of the multi-agent system relies on the connectivity of the communication graph that represents the inter-agent communication topology. The convergence properties are verified through computer simulations.",,第3页.xls

902,Toward Obliging Bots for Supporting Next Actions,2016,"ChatOps is an industry practice of conversation-driven development using instant messaging to automate common development or monitoring tasks. It makes team members communicate with each other efficiently to work, learn and create together. We expect ChatOps to have intelligent agents, which can perform predictive operations based on users' activities, in the near future. To enable such intelligent agents, we worked on building prediction models of users' next actions. We collected action histories and their objectives and then applied sequential pattern mining to predict next actions. The result shows that some rules that meet some conditions could apply in 99% rate. Even if data do not meet the conditions, excluding rules in unnecessary actions improved the quality of the rules. Then, we analyzed generality of rules. To relate different actions as the same action based on an interpretation, the quality of the rules was improved.",,第3页.xls

904,Multi-agent collaborative pursuit algorithm based on game theory and Q-learning,2020,"The multi-agent collaborative pursuit problem is a typical problem in the multi-agent coordination and collaboration research. Aiming at the pursuit problem of single escaper with learning ability, a multi-agent collaborative pursuit algorithm based on game theory and Q-learning was proposed. Firstly, a cooperative pursuit team was established and a game model of cooperative pursuit was built. Secondly, through the learning of the escaper' s strategy choices, the trajectory of the escaper' s limited Step-T cumulative reward was established, and the trajectory was adjusted to the pursuer' s strategy set. Finally, the Nash equilibrium solution was obtained by solving the cooperative pursuit game, and the equilibrium strategy was executed by each agent to complete the pursuit task. At the same time, in order to solve the problem that there may be multiple equilibrium solutions, the virtual action behavior selection algorithm was added to select the optimal equilibrium strategy. C# simulation experiments show that, the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the pursuit problem of single escaper with learning ability in the obstacle environment, and the comparative analysis of experimental data shows that the pursuit efficiency of the algorithm under the same conditions is better than that of pure game or pure learning.",,第3页.xls

An opportunity exists in utilizing social software to enhance the quality of life of ourselves and those important to us. In our research we focus on elementary school children as they begin to discover their surrounding areas, and become more involved in interaction with their peers. We explore the possibility of providing socio-geographical support by creating a system of electronic partners (or ePartners), which are intelligent agents that function as teammates to their human users. Since social contexts and familial situations can vary, it is crucial that ePartners are capable of providing personalized support. We aim to achieve that by providing a rich specification language, allowing users to enter their social requirements into the ePartner as norms.",,第3页.xls

In the scenario we consider, only the leaders are aware of the global mission, which is to converge to a known destination point. Thus, the objective of the leaders is to drag the team to the desired goal. In the paper we obtain bounds on the number of leaders needed to complete the task while guaranteeing that connectedness of the communication graph is maintained. The results are first established for an initially complete communication graph and then extended to the incomplete case. The results are illustrated by computer simulations.",,第3页.xls

But the effective fault diagnosis methods are rarely specific to the electrical fault of modern buildings. Our team has made researches on it and several fault diagnosis methods have been developed. In this paper, we focused on the design of the whole fault diagnosis system. The building electrical platform is selected as the research object, and we design a building electrical fault diagnosis system based on multi-Agent. The designed system consists of three main subsystems: monitoring subsystem, Agent subsystem and user interface subsystem. With those fault diagnosis methods running on it, the system can achieve condition monitoring and fault diagnosis automatically and efficiently. Also, the system has good acclimatization.",,第3页.xls
908,Between control and creativity: challenging co-creation and social media use in a museum context,2014,"This article addresses the challenges and limitations of co-creation processes in museums based on an exemplary case of the design of a Danish museum-related campaign on Facebook. The article adds to the ongoing discussion on the paradigm shift in the museum by analysing potential problematical issues of including multiple agents in creative processes in museums. It concludes that it is arduous to establish a truly creative co-creative process, when the design team needs to accommodate to a well-established artistic vision as well as to the limited resources of the museum and the other participants. We argue that one cannot in advance predict or ascertain that social media users will find a campaign compelling and want to participate and engage with the content, even if substantial resources have gone into its creation. Furthermore, the complexity of many art projects is likely to make their dissemination on social media difficult.",,第3页.xls
909,A cyclic pursuit framework for networked mobile agents based on vector field approach,2019,"This paper proposes a pursuit formation control scheme for a network of double-integrator mobile agents based on a vector field approach. In a leaderless architecture, each agent pursues another one via a cyclic topology to achieve a regular polygon formation. On the other hand, the agents are exposed to a rotational vector field such that they rotate around the vector field centroid, while they keep the regular polygon formation. The main problem of existing approaches in the literature for cyclic pursuit of double-integrator multiagent systems is that under those approaches, the swarm angular velocity and centroid are not controllable based on missions and agents capabilities. However, by employing the proposed vector field approach in this paper, while keeping a regular polygon formation, the swarm angular velocity and centroid can be determined arbitrary. The obtained results can be extended to achieve elliptical formations with cyclic pursuit as well. Simulation results for a team of eight mobile agents verify the accuracy of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第3页.xls
910,Towards modelling a multi-agent knowledge system in engineering design,1994,"Engineering design projects represent a class of complex synthesis problem. It is characterised by a large solution space and a sequence of decision-making steps at each state in the solution space. An effective solution for such problems depends upon cooperative participation of a number of specialist teams. AI research has been focused in understanding cooperative knowledge systems. The question centre around the complexity of separate knowledge sources in terms of heterarchical and hierarchical organization structure and convergence of design cycle. In this paper, we discuss an approach that employs a set of cooperative knowledge sources involved in design process at various stages of VLSI design, interacting through a common blackboard architecture. A conceptual model based on blackboard architecture is introduced to manage knowledge associated with VLSI design. A case study on the design of VLSI floorplan is considered. The framework enables one to generate, evaluate and come out with alternative design decisions.",,第3页.xls

The method uses the granular agent to denote the set of examples that have similar attributions and the knowledge base guides the evolutionary of granular agent. Also some granular evolutionary operators are designed for classification problem. Assimilation operator, exchange operator, and differentiation operator reflect the competitive, cooperative and self-learning ability of agent respectively. Finally, some classification rules are extracted from granular agents by some strategies to forecast the sort of new data. Empirical studies show that the algorithm has a good classification prediction, and only need a small price for the training time. In most UCI datasets, the performance of GAEC is better than G-NET, OCEC and C4.5, which have good performance.",,第3页.xls

Taking one typical production cell of motorcycle engine key parts as an example, simulation experiments for skill types, skill level, and work allocation of the organization were conducted based on human-machine collaboration model. The simulation results showed that the skill level and collaboration styles of operation staffs had significant impact on order fulfilling time. The human-machine collaborative simulation model realized dynamic and quantitative evaluation on the organization resource configuration, and therefore helped the production team make reasonable decision on organization resource training and allocation.",,第3页.xls
914,The effect of incentive schemes and organizational arrangements on the new product development process,2001,"This paper proposes a new model for studying the new product development process in an artificial environment. We show how connectionist models can be used to simulate the adaptive nature of agents' learning exhibiting similar behavior as practically experienced learning curves. We study the impact of incentive schemes (local, hybrid, and global) on the new product development process for different types of organizations. Sequential organizational structures are compared to two different types of team-based organizations, incorporating methods of quality function deployment such as the house of quality. A key finding of this analysis is that the firms' organizational structure and agents' incentive system significantly interact. We show that the house of quality is less affected by the incentive scheme than firms using a trial and error approach. This becomes an important factor for new product success when the agents' performance measures are conflicting.",,第3页.xls
915,Search algorithm for optimal execution of incident commander guidance in macro action planning,2015,"This paper presents a state space search algorithm that solves the optimal execution problem of incident commanders guidance during disaster emergency management. To achieve a joint goal, the IC should select the best choice, as an optimal strategic decision, from available alternatives in a definite time. A strategic decision coordinates/controls macro actions of a team of field units by constraining a subteam to a subgoal in sublocation in a time window; moreover a sequence of strategic decisions generates a macro action plan that defines how to reach the goal. Three results are achieved by running this algorithm for a scenario: (1) calculate an optimal macro action plan; (2) estimate a minimum total time to achieve ajoint goal and (3) reason about the best choice.

917,Architectonic Elucidation for a Network Organization,2015,"There are many actual groups that rely on networks to organize their activities. Arab Spring and Science Teams are two examples. One of our original motivations in this work was to build models that explain and understand how these groups form and operate. We have recognized that there are many environments that do not yet take full advantage of network features (e.g., electric and water supply coops). This prompted our second motivation to propose an automation model using networks for the latter group. We then wanted to combine our motivations to conceive of a unified model of network organizations. A unified model seemed to be limited to requirements of specific domains. In order to extricate ourselves from domains, we considered modeling at a more generalized level that cut across domains. The best way to formulate this was to consider a perspective that would model a generic network organization. This perspective came to be considered, in this paper, as a paradigm. For network centricity in this paradigm, synergy and social capital are introduced as specific network effects to enhance performance at various levels of an organization.",,第3页.xls
918,Design Thinking Framework for Integration of Transparency Measures in Time-Critical Decision Support,2022,"The integration of artificial intelligence transparency in time-critical decision support is complex and requires consideration of the impact on human-machine teaming. The relationships between transparency, trust, workload, and situational awareness are key to understanding this impact on performance. We detail the development of a novel design framework for transparency integration in Decision Support Systems. We selected the design thinking approach as the baseline for our framework as this focuses on developing empathy with users and rapid design iteration. We adapted this framework by introducing the concept of empathy for both human and machine agents. In this situation, empathy is providing a deep understanding of the model, its purpose and the underlying data for AI. We developed a structured problem definition focused on understanding the relationships between constructs and established solution themes to guide the designer.

The authors propose the following approach: (1) By inputting sensor information to a task template and a task-interaction template, tasks will be dynamically generated. (2) The planner consists of two parts, the task-assignment planner and the motion planner (the latter is made independently for each task); (3) The task-assignment problem is solved by using a linear programming method based on the execution priority described in the task templates.

920,Use of an Artificial Intelligence Conversational Agent (Chatbot) for Hip Arthroscopy Patients Following Surgery.,2023,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an AI conversational agent during the postoperative recovery of patients undergoing elective hip arthroscopy.Methods: Patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were enrolled in a prospective cohort for their first 6 weeks following surgery. Patients used standard SMS text messaging to interact with an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot (Felix) used to initiate automated conversations regarding elements of postoperative recovery. Patient satisfaction was measured at 6 weeks after surgery using a Likert scale survey. Accuracy was determined by measuring the appropriateness of chatbot responses, topic recognition, and examples of confusion. Safety was measured by evaluating the chatbot's responses to any questions with potential medical urgency.Results: Twenty-six patients were enrolled with a mean age of 36 years, and 58% (n= 15) were male. Overall, 80% of patients (n= 20) rated the helpfulness of Felix as good or excellent. In the postoperative period, 12/25 (48%) patients reported being worried about a complication but were reassured by Felix and, thus, did not seek medical attention. Of a total of 128 independent patient questions, Felix handled 101/128 questions appropriately (79%), either by addressing them independently, or facilitating contact with the care team. Felix was able to adequately answer the patient question independently 31% of the time (n= 40/128). Of 10 patient questions that were thought to potentially represent patient complications, in 3 cases Felix did not adequately address or recognize the health concern-none of these situations resulted in patient harm.Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that the use of a chatbot or conversational agent can enhance the postoperative experience for hip arthroscopy patients, as demonstrated by high levels of patient satisfaction.Levels of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series.",,第3页.xls

Existing results on connectivity preservation of unicycles are first extended to the problems involving static leaders. These extensions are then used to design connectivity preserving controllers for containment of the followers by static leaders for unicycle agents, as the main contribution of this work. The results are first obtained for a static information flow graph, and are then shown to be valid for the case of dynamic edge addition as well. A Lyapunov functional and an important property of positive limit sets of nonlinear systems are used to show the convergence of followers to the convex hull of the leaders.

The presented concept bases on the theory of cognitive and cooperative automation and suggests that unmanned aircraft are equipped with on-board artificial cognitive units (ACUs). By this, unmanned platforms are enabled to exhibit cooperative capabilities and rational behavior in the context of the mission. To accomplish efficient manned-unmanned cooperation the concept additionally proposes to support the pilot with an assistant system module for team coordination tasks and to provide a self-explanation capability to the unmanned aircraft.

925,A bioinspired multi-agent system based on monocular vision,2017,"Develop multi-robot real-time applications is a complex task. In order to deal with such scenarios, this paper proposes PheroSLAM, a bio-inspired multi-robot system based on monocular camera, which adopt an extended version of ant colony optimisation approach to coordinate multiple-robot teams. Moreover, robots launch repulsive artificial pheromone around themself, creating a repulsive trail in PheroSLAM system. A vision-based mechanism is also used to provide visual odometry and to build a 3D feature-based map, considering that every robot must be able to localise itself in the explored environment. Therefore, the relevance of the proposal is to extend an SLAM problem for many robots and promote the robots move autonomously in the environment according a bio-inspired coordination strategy. Experimental evidences indicated the dispersibility of the PheroSLAM system, increasing the covered area of an environment. Also, results showed that the coordination strategy is efficient and satisfactory to accomplish the exploration task.",,第3页.xls

927,Decoupled Multiagent Path Planning via Incremental Sequential Convex Programming,2015,"This paper presents a multiagent path planning algorithm based on sequential convex programming (SCP) that finds locally optimal trajectories. Previous work using SCP efficiently computes motion plans in convex spaces with no static obstacles. In many scenarios where the spaces are non-convex, previous SCP-based algorithms failed to find feasible solutions because the convex approximation of collision constraints leads to forming a sequence of infeasible optimization problems. This paper addresses this problem by tightening collision constraints incrementally, thus forming a sequence of more relaxed, feasible intermediate optimization problems. We show that the proposed algorithm increases the probability of finding feasible trajectories by 33% for teams of more than three vehicles in non-convex environments. Further, we show that decoupling the multiagent optimization problem to a number of single-agent optimization problems leads to significant improvement in computational tractability. We develop a decoupled implementation of the proposed algorithm, abbreviated dec-iSCP. We show that dec-iSCP runs 14% faster and finds feasible trajectories with higher probability than a decoupled implementation of previous SCP-based algorithms. The proposed algorithm is real-time implementable and is validated through hardware experiments on a team of quadrotors.",,第3页.xls
928,The Value-Sensitive Conversational Agent Co-Design Framework [arXiv],2023,"Conversational agents (CAs) are gaining traction in both industry and academia, especially with the advent of generative AI and large language models. As these agents are used more broadly by members of the general public and take on a number of critical use cases and social roles, it becomes important to consider the values embedded in these systems. This consideration includes answering questions such as 'whose values get embedded in these agents?' and 'how do those values manifest in the agents being designed?' Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to present the Value-Sensitive Conversational Agent (VSCA) Framework for enabling the collaborative design (co-design) of value-sensitive CAs with relevant stakeholders. Firstly, requirements for co-designing value-sensitive CAs which were identified in previous works are summarised here. Secondly, the practical framework is presented and discussed, including its operationalisation into a design toolkit. The framework facilitates the co-design of three artefacts that elicit stakeholder values and have a technical utility to CA teams to guide CA implementation, enabling the creation of value-embodied CA prototypes. Finally, an evaluation protocol for the framework is proposed where the effects of the framework and toolkit are explored in a design workshop setting to evaluate both the process followed and the outcomes produced.",,第3页.xls
929,Dynamic Vehicle Routing with Indirect Communication via Unattended Ground Sensors,2017,"The performance of mobile agents responding to dynamic, prioritized requests falls under the broad category of dynamic vehicle routing problems. In the typical formulation, agents receive service requests instantaneously. However, as increasing numbers of autonomous agents are employed across large networks there is a need to characterize the performance of these systems in communication constrained environments, where direct contact with the agent may not be possible. This work defines a dynamic, deterministic vehicle routing problem and compares the performance of the agent using three communication schemes: no communication, direct communication, and indirect communication. The goal is to characterize the responsiveness of an indirect, decentralized communication scheme to dynamic task priorities. The presented results show that, under the simulated conditions and for four maps of differing node volumes, the indirect communication mechanism performs on average 3% better than the case with no communication, and under performs the direct communication case by 6%. Furthermore, indirect communication provides the most benefit to agents within the first 50% of their tour. Future work will draw upon this data to develop a decentralized approach for servicing a network of nodes with a team of UAVs.",,第3页.xls

The MASCARET model is proposed to organize the interactions between agents and to provide them reactive, cognitive and social abilities to simulate the physical and social environment. The physical environment represents, in a realistic way, the phenomena that learners and teachers have to take into account. The social environment is simulated by agents executing collaborative and adaptive tasks. These agents realize, in team, procedures that they have to adapt to the environment. The users participate to the training environment through their avatar. In this article, we explain how we integrated, in MASCARET, models necessary to the creation of an intelligent tutoring system. We notably incorporate pedagogical strategies and pedagogical actions. We present pedagogical agents. To validate our model, the SECUREVI application for fire fighters' training is developed.",,第3页.xls
933,Agent Parameters for Building Consultant Teamwork in the Agent-Based Simulation Model Development,2014,"Managing information within building construction activities is a challenging task, particularly when each phases of the building construction involves various types of stakeholders (architects, mechanical, electrical and civil engineers, as well as quantity surveyors). In the planning phase of a construction projects, the architects initiate a project through the design of a building. The design artifact produced by architects is among the examples of the initial information that needs to be delivered to the other stakeholders (such as the engineers). However, the process of disseminating this information involves the complex interaction and iteration of activities. This paper discusses the preliminary work undertaken to extract the parameters involved in building consultant teamwork. We used a thematic analysis approach to identify the parameters for the subsequent development of an agent-based simulation model which simulates the interactions among the stakeholders involved. We validate the identified agent parameters with construction experts and with readings obtained from an Nvivo software report.",,第3页.xls
934,ABMS optimization for emergency departments,2012,"This article presents an agent-based modeling and simulation to design a decision support system for healthcare emergency department (ED) to aid in setting up management guidelines to improve it. This ongoing research is being performed by the Research Group in Individual Oriented Modeling at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona with close collaboration of the hospital staff team of Sabadell. The objective of the proposed procedure is to optimize the performance of such complex and dynamic healthcare EDs, which are overcrowded. Exhaustive search optimization is used to find the optimal ED staff configuration, which includes doctors, triage nurses, and admission personnel, i.e., a multi-dimensional and multi-objective problem. An index is proposed to minimize patient stay time in the ED. The model is implemented using NetLogo. The results obtained by using alternatives Monte Carlo and Pipeline schemes are promising. The impact of these schemes to reduce the computational resources used is described.",,第3页.xls
935,Resource allocation and multiagent policy formulation for resource-limited agents under uncertainty,2003,"The problem of optimal policy formulation for teams of resource-limited agents in stochastic environments is composed of two strongly coupled subproblems: a resource allocation problem and a policy optimization problem, both of which have individually received significant amount of attention. We show how to combine the two problems into a single constrained optimization problem that yields optimal resource allocations and policies that are optimal under these allocations. We model the stochastic environment as a multiagent Markov decision process, with social welfare of the group as the optimization criterion. We augment the standard MDP framework with constraints that ensure that the shared resource limitations are satisfied and formulate a constrained stochastic policy optimization problem that yields optimal policies among the class of realizable ones given the resource limitations. We focus on discrete operationalization resources that determine the actuating capabilities of the agents by defining the sets of actions available to them. We show that the problem of finding optimal policies under such constraints is NP-hard and present a solution algorithm based on mixed integer programming to solve the corresponding optimization problems.",,第3页.xls
936,Distributed Fault Diagnosis for Multiple Mobile Robots Using an Agent Programming Language,2015,"Programming autonomous multi-robot systems can be extremely complex without the use of appropriate software development techniques to abstract away the hardware heterogeneity and to overcome the complexity of distributed software to coordinate autonomous behavior. Moreover, real-world environments are dynamic, which can generate unpredictable events that can lead the robots to failure. This paper presents a highly abstract cooperative fault diagnosis method for a team of mobile robots described through a high level programming environment based on ROS (Robot Operating System) and the Jason multi-agent framework. When a robot detects a failure, it can perform two types of diagnosis methods: a local method executed on the faulty robot itself and a cooperative method where another robot helps the faulty robot to determine the source of failure. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of out approach on two robots.",,第3页.xls
937,An Approach to Agent-Based Supporting System for IT Projects,2010,"The natural development of information technology area stimulates intense growth of various technologies which support basic organization processes. The range of technologies implies appropriate management thereof, as well as accurate correspondence with conducted activities. Abandonment of activities within individual branches in favour of project approach to performed assignments (especially those connected with software development) has recently become a popular subject of management. This approach involves a variety of technologies which support project tasks. Yet the question arises, how to harmonize proper technologies with project management in an effective way. Agent system that is built by authors is a kind of solution to this problem. That system is a kind of tool which serves to help project managers with the choice of a proper method and technology of project management. One of most important decision taken before project start is method and tools selection. When method is not fitted to project team it can provide to project's failure. Also many times client's knowledge about IT project area can be important for getting success.",,第3页.xls
938,Combining theory of mind and abductive reasoning in agent-oriented programming,2023,"This paper presents a novel model, called ToMABD, that endows autonomous agents with Theory of Mind capabilities. ToMABD agents are able to simulate the perspective of the world that their peers have and reason from their perspective. Furthermore, ToMABD agents can reason from the perspective of others down to an arbitrary level of recursion, using Theory of Mind of n(th) order. By combining the previous capability with abductive reasoning, ToMABD agents can infer the beliefs that others were relying upon to select their actions, hence putting them in a more informed position when it comes to their own decision-making. We have tested the ToMABD model in the challenging domain of Hanabi, a game characterised by cooperation and imperfect information. Our results show that the abilities granted by the ToMABD model boost the performance of the team along a variety of metrics, including final score, efficiency of communication, and uncertainty reduction.",,第3页.xls

941,"COMPUTATIONAL RED TEAMING: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE",2011,"The combination of Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques with Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offers a great deal of opportunities for practitioners and Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers alike. CI techniques provide the means to search massive spaces quickly; find possible, better or optimum solutions in these spaces; construct algorithms, functions and strategies to control an autonomous entity; find patterns and relationships within data, information, knowledge or experience; assess risk and identify strategies for risk treatment; and connect the dots to synthesize an overall situational awareness picture that decision makers can utilize. MAS provide the structured, modular, distributed and efficient software environment to simulate systems; the architecture to represent systems and entities naturally; the environment to allow entities to observe, communicate with, negotiate with, orient with respect to, and act upon other entities; the modular representation that allows entities to store and manipulate observations, forming beliefs, desires, goals, plans, and intentions; and the framework to model behavior. By bringing CI and MAS together, we have a powerful computational environment that has the theoretical potential to do many things that one can expect when attempting to structure, understand, and solve a problem.In this article, we follow two objectives. First, we will present Computational Red Teaming (CRT) as the state-of-the-art architecture representing the integration of CI techniques and MAS for understanding competition. Second, we will demonstrate how this integration of MAS and CI benefits practitioners in almost all major application domains by drawing examples from defense, business and engineering. We will present the evolution of CRT by categorizing the different levels of integrating CI and MAS, and highlighting open research questions pertaining to CRT.",,第3页.xls

943,Connectedness Preserving Distributed Swarm Aggregation for Multiple Kinematic Robots,2008,"A distributed swarm aggregation algorithm is developed for a team of multiple kinematic agents. Specifically, each agent is assigned a control law, which is the sum of two elements: a repulsive potential field, which is responsible for the collision avoidance objective, and an attractive potential field, which forces the agents to converge to a configuration where they are close to each other. Furthermore, the attractive potential field forces the agents that are initially located within the sensing radius of an agent to remain within this area for all time. In this way, the connectivity properties of the initially formed communication graph are rendered invariant for the trajectories of the closed-loop system. It is shown that under the proposed control law, agents converge to a configuration where each agent is located at a bounded distance from each of its neighbors. The results are also extended to the case of nonholonomic kinematic unicycle-type agents and to the case of dynamic edge addition. In the latter case, we derive a smaller bound in the swarm size than in the static case.",,第3页.xls
944,Decidability classes for mobile agents computing,2017,"We establish a classification of decision problems that are to be solved by mobile agents operating in unlabeled graphs, using a deterministic protocol. The classification is with respect to the ability of a team of agents to solve decision problems, possibly with the aid of additional information. In particular, our focus is on studying differences between the decidability of a decision problem by agents and its verifiability when a certificate for a positive answer is provided to the agents (the latter is to the former what NP is to Pin the framework of sequential computing). We show that the class MAV of mobile agents verifiable problems is much wider than the class MAD of mobile agents decidable problems. Our main result shows that there exist natural MAV-complete problems: the most difficult problems in this class, to which all problems in MAV are reducible via a natural mobile computing reduction. Beyond the class MAV we show that, for a single agent, three natural orades yield a strictly increasing chain of relative decidability classes. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.",,第3页.xls
945,An Observational Study to Evaluate the Usability and Intent to Adopt an Artificial Intelligence-Powered Medication Reconciliation Tool.,2016,"BACKGROUND: Medication reconciliation (the process of creating an accurate list of all medications a patient is taking) is a widely practiced procedure to reduce medication errors. It is mandated by the Joint Commission and reimbursed by Medicare. Yet, in practice, medication reconciliation is often not effective owing to knowledge gaps in the team. A promising approach to improve medication reconciliation is to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) decision support tools into the process to engage patients and bridge the knowledge gap.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medication reconciliation by engaging the patient, the nurse, and the physician as a team via an iPad tool. With assistance from the AI agent, the patient will review his or her own medication list from the electronic medical record (EMR) and annotate changes, before reviewing together with the physician and making decisions on the shared iPad screen.METHODS: In this study, we developed iPad-based software tools, with AI decision support, to engage patients to self-service medication reconciliation and then share the annotated reconciled list with the physician. To evaluate the software tool's user interface and workflow, a small number of patients (10) in a primary care clinic were recruited, and they were observed through the whole process during a pilot study. The patients are surveyed for the tool's usability afterward.RESULTS: All patients were able to complete the medication reconciliation process correctly. Every patient found at least one error or other issues with their EMR medication lists. All of them reported that the tool was easy to use, and 8 of 10 patients reported that they will use the tool in the future. However, few patients interacted with the learning modules in the tool. The physician and nurses reported the tool to be easy-to-use, easy to integrate into existing workflow, and potentially time-saving.CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a promising tool for a new approach to medication reconciliation. It has the potential to create more accurate medication lists faster, while better informing the patients about their medications and reducing burden on clinicians.",,第3页.xls

947,Towards adjustable autonomy for human-robot interaction in marine systems,2017,"Current research into adjustable, or sliding, autonomy shows that human-in-the-loop robotic systems can greatly improve the efficacy of traditionally teleoperated or fully autonomous systems and the work presented here begins to define a framework of interfaces and controllers in support of multiagent human-robot teams in the marine environment. We present a scenario in which a harbor pilot, assisted by a team of USVs and a ground station operator, brings a ship into port and dock. To this end, we have developed a Robot Operating System (ROS) based Human-Machine Interface (HMI) focusing on the ground station operator and a harbor pilot tablet HMI concept to bridge the gap between current harbor pilot computer interfaces and the tools needed for the pilot to work in a human-robot team. Our preliminary simulations focus on a series of interactions within the sliding autonomy framework using a supervisory switching controller (SSC) as a task server with the human operator utilization ratio as a single feed-back signal. Our preliminary results show that the utilization ratio is sufficient to characterize the SSC for the human-in-the-loop system and appropriately adjust the level of autonomy.",,第3页.xls
948,Flexible decision control in an autonomous trading agent,2009,"Modern electronic commerce creates significant challenges for decision-makers. The trading agent competition for supply-chain management (TAC SCM) is an annual competition among fully-autonomous trading agents designed by teams around the world. Agents attempt to maximize profits in a supply-chain scenario that requires them to coordinate Procurement, Production, and Sales activities in competitive markets. An agent for TAC SCM is a complex piece of software that must operate in a competitive economic environment. We report on results of an informal survey of agent design approaches among the competitors in TAC SCM, and then we describe and evaluate the design of our MinneTAC trading agent. We focus on the use of evaluators - configurable, composable modules for data analysis, modeling, and prediction that are chained together at runtime to support agent decision-making. Through a set of examples, we show how this structure supports Sales and Procurement decisions, and how those decision process can be modified in useful ways by changing evaluator configurations.

949,Multiagent Reinforcement Learning With Unshared Value Functions,2015,"One important approach of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is equilibrium-based MARL, which is a combination of reinforcement learning and game theory. Most existing algorithms involve computationally expensive calculation of mixed strategy equilibria and require agents to replicate the other agents' value functions for equilibrium computing in each state. This is unrealistic since agents may not be willing to share such information due to privacy or safety concerns. This paper aims to develop novel and efficient MARL algorithms without the need for agents to share value functions. First, we adopt pure strategy equilibrium solution concepts instead of mixed strategy equilibria given that a mixed strategy equilibrium is often computationally expensive. In this paper, three types of pure strategy profiles are utilized as equilibrium solution concepts: pure strategy Nash equilibrium, equilibrium-dominating strategy profile, and nonstrict equilibrium-dominating strategy profile. The latter two solution concepts are strategy profiles from which agents can gain higher payoffs than one or more pure strategy Nash equilibria. Theoretical analysis shows that these strategy profiles are symmetric meta equilibria. Second, we propose a multi-step negotiation process for finding pure strategy equilibria since value functions are not shared among agents. By putting these together, we propose a novel MARL algorithm called negotiation-based Q-learning (NegoQ). Experiments are first conducted in grid-world games, which are widely used to evaluate MARL algorithms. In these games, NegoQ learns equilibrium policies and runs significantly faster than existing MARL algorithms (correlated Q-learning and Nash Q-learning). Surprisingly, we find that NegoQ also performs well in team Markov games such as pursuit games, as compared with team-task-oriented MARL algorithms (such as friend Q-learning and distributed Q-learning).",,第3页.xls
950,CONCENSUS: multi-party negotiation support for conflict resolution in concurrent engineering design,1998,"Advances in telematics have led many manufacturing companies in particular to explore the adoption of groupware technology to improve communication between team members. However, complex activities such as conflict resolution are still predominantly facilitated through face-to-face negotiation meetings. Intelligent software agents technology is being applied to support computer-mediated conflict resolution activities, such as information search and retrieval, recording negotiation process history and task allocation - whilst the creative negotiation activities such as generating new solutions, preventing and detecting conflicts are still left to the human experts. This paper describes the development of a framework for the support of multi-party negotiation for multi-agent systems, which will be introduced through a general overview of the requirements of multi-agent negotiation. Finally, the current architecture of the developed prototype for a CONCurrent Engineering Negotiation SUpport System (CONCENSUS) is presented. (C) 1998 Chapman & Hall.",,第3页.xls
951,Human-Collective Collaborative Site Selection [arXiv],2020,"Robotic collectives are large groups (at least 50) of locally sensing and communicating robots that encompass characteristics of swarms and colonies, whose emergent behaviors accomplish complex tasks. Future human-collective teams will extend the ability of operators to monitor, respond, and make decisions in disaster response, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring problems. This manuscript evaluates two collective best-of-n decision models for enabling collectives to identify and choose the highest valued target from a finite set of n targets. Two challenges impede the future use of human-collective shared decisions: 1) environmental bias reduces collective decision accuracy when poorer targets are easier to evaluate than higher quality targets, and 2) little is understood about shared human-collective decision making interaction strategies. The two evaluated collective best-of-n models include an existing insect colony decision model and an extended bias-reducing model that attempts to reduce environmental bias in order to improve accuracy. Collectives using these two strategies are compared independently and as members of human-collective teams. Independently, the extended model is slower than the original model, but the extended algorithm is 57% more accurate in decisions where the optimal option is more difficult to evaluate. Human-collective teams using the bias-reducing model require less operator influence and achieve 25% higher accuracy with difficult decisions, than the human-collective teams using the original model. Further, a novel human-collective interaction strategy enables operators to adjust collective autonomy while making multiple simultaneous decisions.",,第3页.xls
952,Toward a Heterogeneous Multi-robot Framework for Priority-Based Sanitization of Railway Stations,2023,"We present a new framework for the prioritized multi-robot sanitization of railway stations based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The proposed framework allows us to define teams of robots having different sanitizing strategies/capabilities, e.g., faster robots rapidly sanitizing small areas in cooperation with slower but long-range ones. Here, robot-specific policies are defined in order to accommodate the different capabilities of the single agents, while two global metrics are defined to assess the performance of the overall team. This capability of managing heterogeneous teams is an important requirement for the infrastructure manager Rete Ferroviaria Italiana S.p.A., which plans to verify to what extent different technologies or different strategies can be combined to reduce costs or increase cleaning efficiency. We tested our framework considering real data collected by the WiFi network of the main Italian railway station, Roma Termini, comparing its results with a similar Deep Reinforcement Learning system where homogeneous robots are employed.",,第3页.xls
953,The RoboCup Physical Agent Challenge: Phase I,1998,"Traditional AI research has not given due attention to the important role that physical bodies play for agents as their interactions produce complex emergent behaviors to achieve goals in the dynamic real world. The RoboCup Physical Agent Challenge provides a good test bed for studying how physical bodies play a significant role in realizing intelligent behaviors using the RoboCup framework (Kitano et al., 1995). In order for the robots to play a soccer game reasonably well, a wide range of technologies needs to be integrated, and a number of technical breakthroughs must be made. We present three challenging tasks as the RoboCup Physical Agent Challenge Phase I: moving the ball to the specified area (shooting, passing, and dribbling) with no, with stationary, or with moving obstacles; catching the ball from an opponent or a team-mate (receiving, goal keeping, and intercepting); and passing the ball between two players. The first two tasks are concerned with single-agent skills, while the third is related to a simple cooperative behavior. Motivation for these challenges and evaluation methodology is given.",,第3页.xls
954,From insect to Internet: Situated control for networked robot teams,2001,"Ant-like systems take advantage of agents' situatedness to reduce or eliminate the need for centralized control or global knowledge. This reduces the need for complexity of individuals and leads to robust, scalable systems. Such insect-inspired situated approaches have proven effective both for task performance and task allocation. The desire for general, principled techniques for situated interaction has led us to study the exploitation of abstract situatedness - situatedness in non-physical environments. The port-arbitrated behavior-based control approach provides a well-structured abstract behavior space in which agents can participate in situated interaction. We focus on the problem of role assumption, distributed task allocation in which each agent selects its own task-performing role. This paper details our general, principled Broadcast of Local Eligibility (BLE) technique for role-assumption in such behavior-space-situated systems, acid provides experimental results from the CMOMMT target-tracking task.",,第3页.xls

956,ADTEP: An agent-based decision-supporting system for Taguchi experiment planning,2001,"In this paper, we present an agent-based decision-supporting system for Taguchi experiment planning. Among the four major parts of Taguchi experiment, the planning phase includes the most important decision-making issues such as determination of experiment objectives, quality characteristics, and control factors. The planning phase, however, has not been paid proper attention by experiment designers. We have developed ADTEP (Agent-based Decision-supporting system for Taguchi Experiment Planning) to facilitate the planning tasks of experiment designer. ADTEP is composed of two agent-based mechanisms. The first employs an Internet agent that collects the domain knowledge from knowledge providers who may be distributed in remote places. Another agent then visualizes the collected knowledge and reports it to the experiment designer. Engineers who would normally have difficulties in collaborating because of limitations on their time or because they are in different places can easily work together in the same experiment team and brainstorm to make good decisions. The second agent-based mechanism offers context-sensitive advice generated by another intelligent agent during the experiment planning process. It prevents the experiment designer from making mistakes, which will increase the feasibility of the experiment and minimize the unnecessary expense of time and resources.",,第3页.xls
957,Let Me Take Over: Variable Autonomy for Meaningful Human Control.,2021,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to expand its reach, the demand for human control and the development of AI systems that adhere to our legal, ethical, and social values also grows. Many (international and national) institutions have taken steps in this direction and published guidelines for the development and deployment of responsible AI systems. These guidelines, however, rely heavily on high-level statements that provide no clear criteria for system assessment, making the effective control over systems a challenge. Human oversight is one of the requirements being put forward as a means to support human autonomy and agency. In this paper, we argue that human presence alone does not meet this requirement and that such a misconception may limit the use of automation where it can otherwise provide so much benefit across industries. We therefore propose the development of systems with variable autonomy-dynamically adjustable levels of autonomy-as a means of ensuring meaningful human control over an artefact by satisfying all three core values commonly advocated in ethical guidelines: accountability, responsibility, and transparency.",,第3页.xls

959,A Harmony-Seeking Firefly Swarm to the Periodic Replacement of Damaged Sensors by a Team of Mobile Robots,2012,"Mobile robots nowadays can assist wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in many jeopardizing scenarios that unexpectedly arise during their operational lifetime. We focus on an emerging kind of cooperative networking system in which a small team of robotic agents lies at a base station. Their mission is to service an already-deployed WSN by periodically replacing all damaged sensors in the field with passive, spare ones so as to preserve the existing network coverage. This novel application scenario is here baptized as multiple-carrier coverage repair (MC2R) and modeled as a new generalization of the vehicle routing problem. A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm is put forward to derive nearly-optimal sensor replacement trajectories for the robotic fleet in a short running time. The composite scheme relies on a swarm of artificial fireflies in which each individual follows the exploratory principles featured by Harmony Search. Infeasible candidate solutions are gradually driven into feasibility under the influence of a weak Pareto dominance relationship. A repair heuristic is finally applied to yield a full-blown solution. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the first one in literature that tackles MC2R instances. Empirical results indicate that promising solutions can be achieved in a limited time span.",,第3页.xls
960,"Inform, Explain, or Control: Techniques to Adjust End-User Performance Expectations for a Conversational Agent Facilitating Group Chat Discussions",2023,"A conversational agent (CA) effectively facilitates online group discussions at scale. However, users may have expectations about how well the CA would perform that do not match with the actual performance, compromising technology acceptance. We built a facilitator CA that detects a member who has low contribution during a synchronous group chat discussion and asks the person to participate more. We designed three techniques to set end-user expectations about how accurately the CA identifies an under-contributing member: 1)information: explicitly communicating the accuracy of the detection algorithm, 2)explanation: providing an overview of the algorithm and the data used for the detection, and 3)adjustment: enabling users to gain a feeling of control over the algorithm. We conducted an online experiment with 163 crowdworkers in which each group completed a collaborative decision-making task and experienced one of the techniques. Through surveys and interviews, we found that the explanation technique was the most effective strategy overall as it reduced user embarrassment, increased the perceived intelligence of the CA, and helped users better understand the detection algorithm. In contrast, the information technique reduced members' contributions and the adjustment technique led to a more negative perceived discussion experience. We also discovered that the interactions with other team members diluted the effects of the techniques on users' performance expectations and acceptance of the CA. We discuss implications for better designing expectation-setting techniques for AI-team collaboration such as ways to improve collaborative decision outcomes and quality of contributions.",,第3页.xls
961,ON THE MODELING AND AGENT-BASED SIMULATION OF A COOPERATIVE GROUP ANAGRAM GAME,2019,"Anagram games (i.e., word construction games in which players use letters to form words) have been researched for some 60 years. Games with individual players are the subject of over 20 published investigations. Moreover, there are many popular commercial anagram games such as Scrabble. Recently, cooperative team play of anagram games has been studied experimentally. With all of the experimental work and the popularity of such games, it is somewhat surprising that very little modeling of anagram games has been done to predict player behavior/actions in them. We devise a cooperative group anagram game and develop an agent-based modeling and simulation framework to capture player interactions of sharing letters and forming words. Our primary goals are to understand, quantitatively Predict, and explain individual and aggregate group behavior, through simulations, to inform the design of a group anagram game experimental platform.",,第3页.xls

Sentinel system is an intelligent agent of cyberattack-detection kit, whose user interface (UI) was designed and implemented as a proof-of-concept in the simulation. The goal for this sentinel system is to improve the pilots' Situation Awareness (SA) of the system vulnerability and resiliency, such that the HMT performance can be improved against disruptive events. Based on the literature of cyberattacks on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control systems, realistic mission operation and cyberattack scenarios were identified and implemented on a simulated UAV ground control station (GCS). In the follow-up experiment, up to twenty-four Air Force pilots will be instructed to supervise the UAVs under specific mission scenarios, and to respond for system recovery solutions generated on Sentinel UI after detection of cyberattacks. Understanding the interactive behaviors of the pilot and Sentinel under mission contexts and cyberattacks is expected to help improve HMT performance.",,第3页.xls
963,Incentive compatible mechanism design for synthetic task allocation in virtual organizations,2005,"In most computational organizational models, the designers of traditional task allocation mechanisms generally make an implicit assumption that organizational agents will report their true capabilities to the mechanisms. This assumption is not true any more for the virtual organizations [1]. One of the most important benefits of a virtual organization is executing synthetic tasks by forming temporary team composed of experts from different fields and independent organizations through Internet. In this paper, we formalize a synthetic task allocation problem to the algorithmic mechanism design optimization problem [12,15]. Each synthetic task needs to be accomplished through the cooperation among agents who belong to different groups that are self-interested and have different specialties. The objective of this problem is to minimize the total amount of time of finishing a bunch of synthetic tasks. We developed two incentive compatible mechanisms for the synthetic task allocation problem studied in this paper.",,第3页.xls
964,Distributed black virus decontamination and rooted acyclic orientations,2015,"In a network supporting mobile agents, a particular threat is that posed by the presence of a black virus (BV), a harmful entity capable of destroying any agent arriving at the site where it resides, and of then moving to all the neighbouring sites. A moving BV can only be destroyed if it arrives at a site where an anti-viral agent is located. The objective for a team of mobile anti-viral system agents, called cleaners, is to locate and permanently eliminate the BV, whose initial location is unknown. The goal is to perform this task with the minimum number of network infections and agent casualties. The problem of optimal black virus decontamination (BVD) has been investigated for special classes of highly regular network topologies, a (centralized) solution exists for networks of known arbitrary topology. In this paper, we consider the BVD problem in networks of arbitrary and unknown topology, we prove that it can be solved optimally in a purely decentralized way by asynchronous agents provided with 2-hop visibility. In fact, we prove that our proposed protocols always correctly decontaminate the network with theminimum number of system agents' casualties and network infections. Furthermore, we show thatthe total number of system agents is also optimal. Finally, we prove an interesting correspondence between the BVD problem and the problem of computing a rooted acyclic orientation of a given graph with minimum outdegrees. As a consequence, our protocols provide a distributed optimal solution to this graph optimization problem.",,第3页.xls
965,Knowledge-based conflict resolution for cooperation among expert agents,1991,"Cooperating human experts are able to integrate their skills and knowledge productively to achieve goals beyond their individual capabilities. Machine agents may someday increase their power similarly by working in teams of specialized experts. To do this, the systems must be able to communicate knowledge, propose solutions, resolve conflicts that occur during problem-solving and agree on results. The authors describe the Cooperating Experts Framework (CEF), a generic framework that supports cooperative problem-solving among sets of knowledge-based systems. The systems solve subproblems relevant to their specific expertise and integrate their efforts using conflict resolution strategies. CEF provides scheduling and communication support for the agents, a set of conflict resolution strategies, and a set of heuristics for choosing the most effective strategy for the situation. They also describe STEAMER, a system implemented in the CEF framework, that designs steam condensers.",,第3页.xls
966,Safe Explainable Agents for Autonomous Navigation using Evolving Behavior Trees,2023,"Machine learning and reinforcement learning are increasingly used to solve complex tasks in autonomous systems. However, autonomous agents represented by large neural networks are not transparent leading to their assurability and trustworthiness becoming critical challenges. Large models also result in a lack of interpretability which causes severe obstacles related to trust in autonomous agents and human-machine teaming. In this paper, we leverage the hierarchical structure of behavior trees and hierarchical reinforcement learning to develop a neurosymbolic model architecture for autonomous agents. The proposed model, referred to as Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs), integrates the required components to represent the learning tasks as well as the switching between tasks to achieve complex long-term goals. We design an agent for autonomous navigation and we evaluate the approach against a state-of-the-art hierarchical reinforcement learning method using a Maze Simulation Environment. The results show autonomous agents represented by EBTs can be trained efficiently. The approach incorporates explicit safety constraints into the model and incurs significantly fewer safety violations during training and execution. Further, the model provides explanations for the behavior of the autonomous agent by associating the state of the executing EBT with agent actions.",,第3页.xls
967,Conversational Agents for Insurance Companies: From Theory to Practice [arXiv],2019,"Advances in artificial intelligence have renewed interest in conversational agents. Additionally to software developers, today all kinds of employees show interest in new technologies and their possible applications for customers. German insurance companies generally are interested in improving their customer service and digitizing their business processes. In this work we investigate the potential use of conversational agents in insurance companies theoretically by determining which classes of agents exist which are of interest to insurance companies, finding relevant use cases and requirements. We add two practical parts: First we develop a showcase prototype for an exemplary insurance scenario in claim management. Additionally in a second step, we create a prototype focusing on customer service in a chatbot hackathon, fostering innovation in interdisciplinary teams. In this work, we describe the results of both prototypes in detail. We evaluate both chatbots defining criteria for both settings in detail and compare the results and draw conclusions for the maturity of chatbot technology for practical use, describing the opportunities and challenges companies, especially small and medium enterprises, face.

968,Simulating Customer Experience and Word-Of-Mouth in Retail - A Case Study,2010,"Agents offer a new and exciting way of understanding the world of work. In this paper we describe the development of agent-based simulation models, designed to help to understand the relationship between people management practices and retail performance. We report on the current development of our simulation models which includes new features concerning the evolution of customers over time. To test the features we have conducted a series of experiments dealing with customer pool sizes, standard and noise reduction modes, and the spread of customers' word of mouth. To validate and evaluate our model, we introduce new performance measure specific to retail operations. We show that by varying different parameters in our model we can simulate a range of customer experiences leading to significant differences in performance measures. Ultimately, we are interested in better understanding the impact of changes in staff behavior due to changes in store management practices. Our multi-disciplinary research team draws upon expertise from work psychologists and computer scientists. Despite the fact we are working within a relatively novel and complex domain, it is clear that intelligent agents offer potential for fostering sustainable organizational capabilities in the future.",,第3页.xls
969,"Exploring large-scale, distributed system behavior with a focus on information assurance",2001,"Large distributed, heterogeneous systems (LDHS's) are increasingly critical to our computational infrastructure, but security research in this area has been difficult. Traditional approaches involve time-consuming and non-repeatable red-team attacks, where results are often incomplete and difficult to interpret. An alternative involves formal analysis of models, but this approach is not feasible with. dynamic, heterogeneous systems. The Agent-Based Configurable (ABC) Testbed combines modeling and simulation with innovative visualization. In the ABC Testbed, researchers can model system components at suitable levels of fidelity, execute those models, and analyze the resulting data set, which captures all actions performed by system components, as well as the causes of these actions, or Events. The ABC Testbed's visualization tool represents these Events as a directed graph, which permits powerful analysis, exploration, and drill-down capabilities. To date, we have developed a prototype of the ABC Testbed, and demonstrated its power by emulating a live experiment and exploring its detailed behavior.",,第3页.xls
970,Multi-Agent Intention Recognition using Logical Hidden Semi-Markov Models,2014,"Intention recognition (IR) is significant for creating humanlike and intellectual agents in simulation systems. Previous widely used probabilistic graphical methods such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) cannot handle unstructural data, so logical hidden Markov models (LHMMs) are proposed by combining HMMs and first order logic. Logical hidden semi-Markov models (LHSMMs) further extend LHMMs by modeling duration of hidden states explicitly and relax the Markov assumption. In this paper, LHSMMs are used in multi-agent intention recognition (MAIR), which identifies not only intentions of every agent but also working modes of the team considering cooperation. Logical predicates and connectives are used to present the working mode; conditional transition probabilities and changeable instances alphabet depending on available observations are introduced; and inference process based on the logical forward algorithm with duration is given. A simple game Killing monsters is also designed to evaluate the performance of LHSMMs with its graphical representation depicted to describe activities in the game. The simulation results show that, LHSMMs can get reliable results of recognizing working modes and smoother probability curves than LHMMs. Our models can even recognize destinations of the agent in advance by making use of the cooperation information.",,第3页.xls
971,Enhancements for Monte-Carlo Tree Search in Ms Pac-Man,2012,"In this paper enhancements for the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework are investigated to play Ms Pac-Man. MCTS is used to find an optimal path for an agent at each turn, determining the move to make based on randomised simulations. Ms Pac-Man is a real-time arcade game, in which the protagonist has several independent goals but no conclusive terminal state. Unlike games such as Chess or Go there is no state in which the player wins the game. Furthermore, the Pac-Man agent has to compete with a range of different ghost agents, hence limited assumptions can be made about the opponent's behaviour. In order to expand the capabilities of existing MCTS agents, five enhancements are discussed: 1) a variable depth tree, 2) playout strategies for the ghost-team and Pac-Man, 3) including long-term goals in scoring, 4) endgame tactics, and 5) a Last-Good-Reply policy for memorising rewarding moves during playouts. An average performance gain of 40,962 points, compared to the average score of the top scoring Pac-Man agent during the CIG'11, is achieved by employing these methods.",,第3页.xls
972,INTELLIGENT MULTIAGENT COORDINATION BASED ON REINFORCEMENT HIERARCHICAL NEURO-FUZZY MODELS,2014,"This paper presents the research and development of two hybrid neuro-fuzzy models for the hierarchical coordination of multiple intelligent agents. The main objective of the models is to have multiple agents interact intelligently with each other in complex systems. We developed two new models of coordination for intelligent multiagent systems, which integrates the Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical Neuro-Fuzzy model with two proposed coordination mechanisms: the MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical Neuro-Fuzzy with a market-driven coordination mechanism (MA-RL-HNFP-MD) and the MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical Neuro-Fuzzy with graph coordination (MA-RL-HNFP-CG). In order to evaluate the proposed models and verify the contribution of the proposed coordination mechanisms, two multiagent benchmark applications were developed: the pursuit game and the robot soccer simulation. The results obtained demonstrated that the proposed coordination mechanisms greatly improve the performance of the multiagent system when compared with other strategies.",,第3页.xls
973,Interactive mechanism for cooperative design in Web environment based on multi-agent technology,2006,"Considering the low efficient of resource reuse for lack of consideration of user's role, team, design stage, and individuation in design activity, an agent-based interactive mechanism is proposed to build CSCW supported environment. Firstly, an interactive agent model is used to describe user feature in CSCW design activity. The definition of role, people preference, ability description as well as the definition of action, mental state, and other descriptions is formally represented in ABI agent structure. Then, based on analysis of design activity, a general design meta-resource (DMR) structure is constructed as the basic meta-unit to extract, organize, manage, and operate resources. Therefore, by combining user feature with design resource feature into resource matching calculation, design resources are accessed and pushed to the people with more pertinence. A practical resource-based system has been implemented for a jewel design enterprise. The result shows that the system makes design activity more effectively by pushing design resources with a high precision.",,第3页.xls

The system can be used to aid learning and teaching in different subject areas and to provide user-oriented support in searching course-related information, concept teaching and learning, and conceptual and task-oriented domain structuring. AIMS has an agent-based system architecture, which accommodates a team of agents mediating the process of providing information to the individual user. Each of those agents is an active system entity characterised by a set of specific roles with respect to the main system functionality. In this paper we present a general view on AIMS with an emphasis on its agent-based architecture and the domain and user knowledge.",,第3页.xls

976,Convergence Rates of Average-Reward Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Randomized Linear Programming,2022,"In tabular multi-agent reinforcement learning with average-cost criterion, a team of agents sequentially interacts with the environment and observes local incentives. We focus on the case that the global reward is a sum of local rewards, the joint policy factorizes into agents' marginals, and full state observability. To date, few global optimality guarantees exist even for this simple setting, as most results yield convergence to stationarity for parameterized policies in large/possibly continuous spaces. To solidify the foundations of MARL, we build upon linear programming (LP) reformulations, for which stochastic primal-dual methods yield a model-free approach to achieve optimal sample complexity in the centralized case. We develop multi-agent extensions, whereby agents solve their local saddle point problems and then perform local weighted averaging. We establish that the sample complexity to obtain near-globally optimal solutions matches tight dependencies on the cardinality of the state and action spaces, and exhibits classical scalings with respect to the network in accordance with multi-agent optimization. Experiments corroborate these results in practice.",,第3页.xls
977,Distributed resource scheduling based on multi-node negotiation for grid systems,2007,"An intelligent resource scheduling strategy for grid systems was proposed based on the theory of multi-agent. Grid nodes independently chose subtasks in grid systems. Due to the autonomous characteristics of grid nodes, different support degrees were assigned to each grid node for different tasks. The fuzzy cognitive map was employed to construct a support degree negotiation model. Considering that each grid node possesses different types of resources, definition of the standard support degree was presented to ensure feasibility and validity of the support degree negotiation model. Without the upper level resource scheduling unit, task teams were constituted by multiple grid nodes through competition and negotiation to maximize interests of each grid node. The proposed scheduling method is applicable for distributed computation, which makes the grid computation system possess better real-time performance and robustness.",,第3页.xls

Biter implements a client for the RoboCup simulator. It provides users with the basic functionality needed to start designing sophisticated RoboCup teams. Some of its features include a world model with absolute coordinates, a graphical debugging tool, a set of utility functions, and a generic agent architecture (GAA) with some basic behaviors such as dribble ball to goal and dash to ball. The GAA incorporates an elegant object-oriented design meant to handle the type of activities typical for an agent in a multiagent system. These activities include reactive responses, long-term behaviors, and conversations with other agents.

979,The effects of co-operation on multiagent search in task-oriented domains,2004,"This paper studies the benefits of teaming and selflessness when using multiagent search to solve task-oriented problems. A formal framework for multiagent search is presented, which forms a superset of the task-oriented domain, coalition formation, distributed constraint satisfaction and NK landscape search problems. The paper focuses on task-oriented domain problems and shows how the benefits of teaming and selflessness arise in this domain. These experimental results are compared to similar results in the NK domain - from which a predictive technique is imported. Namely, it is shown that better allocations are found when the dynamics of the multiagent system lie between order and chaos. Several other specific findings are presented such as the fact that neither absolute selfishness nor absolute selflessness result in better allocations, and the fact that the formation of small teams usually leads to better allocations.",,第3页.xls
980,Expert Finding and Query Answering for Collaborative Inter-organizational System by Using Rule Responder,2011,"Collaborative inter-organizational system (C-IOS) is defined as information technology-based systems that engage multiple business partners for achieving some common value-added goals. In the past, many papers from the literature addressed a large number of techniques on collaborative agents. The techniques range from basic information exchange to sophisticated negotiation. Specifically, for C-IOS's two important tasks namely Experts Finding (EF) and Query Answering (QA) are required in collaboration. These two specific tasks facilitate supply-chain mediation and may be subsequent procurement negotiation. EF concerns about finding or match-making the right personnel in an organization as a committee member for fulfilling a part of the job. QA screens initially whether the resources and commitments are potentially available. The two tasks supposedly would have executed prior to any further collaboration, and the communication is cross organizations. This paper contributes a design of C-IOS that supports EF and QA for inter-organizational collaboration. The underlying technical framework is by Rule Responder which is a powerful tool for creating virtual organizations as multi-agent systems that support collaborative teams on the Semantic Web. A use case of hosting an academic conference among different organizations is illustrated with our proposed concepts in this paper.",,第3页.xls
981,A multi-user virtual environment for building and assessing higher order inquiry skills in science,2010,"This study investigated novel pedagogies for helping teachers infuse inquiry into a standards-based science curriculum.

The students interacted with 'avatars' of other students, digital artefacts and computer-based 'agents' acting as mentors and colleagues in a virtual community of practice set during the time period when bacteria were just being discovered. This paper describes the results from three implementations of the River City, virtual environment in 200405 with approximately 2000 students from geographically diverse urban areas.

It is argued that some instances lend themselves to a distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) approach. The use of DAI techniques in current telecommunications systems appears quite natural in light of two trends in the way these systems are designed: the distribution of functionality and the incorporation of intelligence. The author illustrates the relevance of DAI techniques to the feature-interaction problem by discussing existing work (lodes, team-CPS, multistage negotiation, and negotiating agents) that address one or more instances of the problem. He further identifies the kind of cooperation and coordination that the feature-interaction problem requires and the interesting research problems it poses to distributed artificial intelligence.",,第3页.xls
983,Informing food protection education: a project to define and classify resources for a cross-disciplinary expert community,2011,"In the wake of the September 2001 attacks, the U.S. government founded the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with responsibility to develop a National Infrastructure Protection Plan for securing critical infrastructures and key resources. DHS established interdisciplinary networks of academic expertise administered through Centers of Excellence across the country, each addressing a different aspect of homeland defense. The National Center for Food Protection and Defense (NCFPD), created in 2004, organized over 150 experts around five theme groups: Agent Behavior, Event Modeling, Systems Strategies, Risk Communication, and Educational Programs. The fifth theme group, Educational Programs, was the focus of a special library project to assist experts in delivering high-quality education and training programs to develop a cadre of professionals equipped to deal with future threats to the food system. An initial database provided National Center for Food Protection and Defense experts with a listing of educational resources and their uniform resource locators (URLs). In 2009, NCFPD formed a team of librarians and subject experts to finalize the framework for a working collection of food protection educational resources. The framework consisted of 1) a scope of work for the database, 2) descriptive metadata elements and classification decisions, and 3) a vetting instrument to maintain the utility and currency of selected information. This paper describes the work performed by the database team to create criteria for inclusion and classification of resources consistent with NCFPD end-users' evolving needs. A content validity method is described that was used to gauge whether the team's conceptual definition of the domain of information was congruent with that of the expert community being served.",,第3页.xls

We describe the agent models and communication mechanism, and explain how they handle complex interactions among agents. A distributed trajectory planning approach based on artificial potential fields is also presented.Experimental results show that our multi-agent planning and control framework is suitable for flexible robotic assembly tasks.

986,Design and analysis of agents for supply chain management: experiences from the trading agent competition,2008,"Rapid globalization in recent decades and the consequent demands make it essential for supply chains (SCs) and their managers to account for real-world dynamics in managing businesses to successfully compete and emerge as market leaders. The vast majority of SC models discussed in the literature are static: greatly stylized, generally local and decision specific. While they present a number of important insights into the working of SCs, they are constricted by the model-related assumptions and replication- related problems. The dynamic nature of the business environment is subjecting SC players to a much more volatile market environment than ever before. Agent-based solutions are particularly relevant in this changing market context. Agent-based approach for supply chain management (SCM) was given a boost with the unveiling of the TAC-SCM competition in 2003 by Carnegie Mellon university and the Swedish institute of computer science through the trading agent competition (TAC). Based on our competition experience for 2 years, we advocate in this paper the importance of incorporating real-world marketplace dynamics into SC modelling through agent-based solutions. We present innovative strategies adopted by some of the successful teams in the competition and detail important aspects of our own agent.",,第3页.xls

On a soccer field the core capabilities a player must have are to navigate the field, track the ball and other agents, recognize the difference between agents, collaborate with other agents, and hit the ball in the correct direction. USC's Dreamteam of robots can be described as a group of mobile autonomous agents collaborating in a rapidly changing environment. The key characteristic of this team is that each soccer robot is an autonomous agent, self-contained with all of its essential capabilities on-board. Our robots share the same general architecture and basic hardware, but they have integrated abilities to play different roles (goalkeeper, defender or forward) and utilize different strategies in their behavior. Our philosophy in building these robots is to use the least possible sophistication to make them as robust as possible.

988,Multi-Agent Distributed Cooperation Decision Making Based on Incomplete Information Prediction,2022,"In order to solve the problem of difficulty in learning cooperative strategies and decision-making of multi-agent caused by the incomplete information and the inability to guarantee stable communication in the partial observable multi-agent adversarial environment, inspired by the learning and reasoning functions of the human cerebral cortex through memory, a new multi-agent distributed cooperative strategy learning method based on incomplete information prediction in a partially observable adversarial environment is proposed. Through the use of historical memory and current observation information, support vector regression (SVR) is used to predict invisible information in the environment, and the prediction information of the unobserved part and the observed information are fused as the basis for cooperative strategy learning and decision-making. Then, through the use of decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning method for cooperative strategy learning, the decision model of each agent in the team is obtained. The method is verified by multi-agent cooperative strategy learning and decision-making in a typical partial observable adversarial environment. The results show that this method can significantly improve the level of multi-agent cooperative decision-making while ensuring high prediction accuracy for unobserved parts.",,第3页.xls
989,A multi-agent architecture for teaching dermatology.,1998,"This work proposes the integration of computer-aided instruction systems in the curricula of medical education, and describes an intelligent tutoring system used for teaching Dermatology. The Dermatology Tutor uses a self-organized society of autonomous software agents which have different capabilities or roles. The society contains tutor, medical and information agents which participate in the tutoring process and collaborate through deliberation in order to achieve a tutoring task. The agents are built according to a BDI architecture, which implements the mental attitudes of beliefs (B), desires (D) and intentions (I). Each medical agent is a specialist in a medical field, while a tutoring agent, which implements a widely accepted dermatology teaching process, coordinates the overall operation of the system. Depending on the subject that is to be taught during any session, the tutoring agent forms teams of medical agents, which in turn use search agents to retrieve information. Although the presented multi-agent architecture is dedicated to teaching dermatology (since the tutor agent is specialized in Dermatology), it can be extended to other domains also with the incorporation of other tutor agents.",,第3页.xls

991,COSMOA an ontology-centric multi-agent system for co-ordinating medical responses to large-scale disasters,2005,"Planning for large-scale disasters is becoming increasingly important especially with terrorism on the rise. Preparations are particularly necessary in the planning and provision of emergency medical services. Whilst emergency service training exercises have improved the situation current emergency plans can be rigid and may not take into account the operational conditions at the time. Gathering information from distributed sources, integrating it and then making decisions are required in order to make plans more dynamic. Such complexity makes it impossible for any single human or even a team to fulfil the roles adequately. In this paper we discuss how multi-agent systems can be employed to help address this problem. We describe COSMOA an ontology-centric multi-agent system for supporting hospitals during the response to a large-scale disaster by producing a web-based emergency plan. A prototype of COSMOA has been implemented and we discuss some of the preliminary results.",,第3页.xls

993,Periodic Data Retrieval Problem in Rings Containing a Malicious Host,2010,"In the problems of exploration of faulty graphs, a team of cooperating agents is considered moving in a network containing one or more nodes that can harm the agents. A most notable among these problems is the problem of black hole location, where the network contains one node that destroys any incoming agent, and the task of the agents is to determine the location of this node. The main complexity measure is the number of agents needed to solve the problem. In this paper we begin with a study of malicious hosts with more varied behavior. We study the problem of periodic data retrieval which is equivalent to periodic exploration in fault-free networks, and to black hole location in networks with one black hole. The main result of the paper states that, in case of rings, it is sufficient to protect the internal state of the agent (i.e. the malicious host cannot change or create the content of agent's memory), and the periodic data retrieval problem is solvable by a constant number of agents.",,第3页.xls
994,Multi-Agent Hierarchical Architecture Modeling Kinematic Chains employing Continuous RL Learning with Fuzzified State Space,2008,"In the context of multi-agent systems, we are proposing a hierarchical robot control architecture that comprises artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and traditional control methodologies, based on the realization of a learning team of agents in a continuous problem setting. In a multi-agent system, action selection is important for cooperation and coordination among the agents. By employing reinforcement learning (RL) methods in a fuzzified state-space, we accomplish to design a control architecture and a corresponding methodology, engaged in a continuous space, which enables the agents to learn, over a period of time, to perform sequences of continuous actions in a cooperative manner, in order to reach their goal without any prior generated task model. By organizing the agents in a nested architecture, as proposed in this work, a type of problem-specific recursive knowledge acquisition is attempted. Furthermore, the agents try to exploit the knowledge gathered in order to be in position to execute tasks that indicate certain degree of similarity. The agents correspond in fact to independent degrees of freedom of the system, and achieve to gain experience over the task that they collaboratively perform, by exploring and exploiting their state-to-action mapping space. A numerical experiment is presented in this paper, performed on a simulated planar 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator, in order to evaluate both the proposed hierarchical multi-agent architecture as well as the proposed methodological framework. It is anticipated that such an approach can be highly scalable for the control of robotic systems that are kinematically more complex, comprising multiple DOFs and potentially redundancies in open or closed kinematic chains, particularly dexterous manipulators.",,第3页.xls
995,Mission operations with an autonomous agent,1998,"The Remote Agent (RA) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system which automates some of the tasks normally reserved for human mission operators and performs these tasks autonomously on-board the spacecraft. These tasks include activity generation, sequencing, spacecraft analysis, and failure recovery. The RA will be demonstrated as a flight experiment on Deep Space One (DS1), the first deep space mission of the NASA's New Millennium Program (NMP). As we moved from prototyping into actual flight code development and teamed with ground operators, we made several major extensions to the RA architecture to address the broader operational context in which RA would be used. These extensions support ground operators and the RA sharing a long-range mission profile with facilities for asynchronous ground updates; support ground operators monitoring and commanding the spacecraft at multiple levels of detail simultaneously; and enable ground operators to provide additional knowledge to the RA, such as parameter updates, model updates, and diagnostic information, without interfering with the activities of the RA or leaving the system in an inconsistent state.The resulting architecture supports incremental autonomy, in which a basic agent can be delivered early and then used in an increasingly autonomous manner over the lifetime of the mission It also supports variable autonomy, as it enables ground operators to benefit from autonomy when they want it but does not inhibit them from obtaining a detailed understanding and exercising tighter control when necessary. These issues are critical to the successful development and operation of autonomous spacecraft.",,第3页.xls
996,"A unified framework for reinforcement learning, co-learning and meta-learning how to coordinate in collaborative multi-agent systems",2010,"Coordination among multiple autonomous, distributed cognitive agents is one of the most challenging and ubiquitous problems in Distributed AI and its applications in general, and in collaborative multi-agent systems in particular. A particularly prominent problem in multi-agent coordination is that of group, team or coalition formation. A considerable majority of the approaches to this problem found in the literature assume fixed interactions among autonomous agents involved in the coalition formation process. Moreover, most of the prior research where agents are actually able to learn and adapt based on their past interactions mainly focuses on reinforcement learning techniques at the individual agent level. We argue that, in many important applications and contexts, complex large-scale collaborative multi-agent systems need to be able to learn and adapt at multiple organization, hierarchical and logical levels. In particular, the agents need to be able to learn both at the level of individual agents and at the system or agent ensemble levels, and then to integrate these different sources of learned knowledge and behavior, in order to be effective at solving complex tasks in typical dynamic, partially observable and noisy multi-agent environments. In this paper, we describe a conceptual framework for addressing the problem of learning how to coordinate effectively at three qualitatively distinct levels - those of (i) individual agents, (ii) small groups of agents, and (iii) very large agent ensembles (or alternatively, depending on the nature of a multi-agent system, at the system or central control level). We briefly illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed conceptual framework with an example of how it would apply to an important practical coordination problem, namely that of distributed coordination of a large ensemble of unmanned vehicles on a complex multi-task mission.

997,Improving Coordination via Emergent Communication in Cooperative Multiagent Systems: A Genetic Network Programming Approach,2009,"The design and development of strategies to coordinate the actions of multiple agents is a central research issue in the field of multiagent systems. To address this issue, in our previously reported research we proposed a novel methodology based on Genetic Network Programming (GNP) to allow agents in the pursuit domain to autonomously learn an effective coordination strategy in order to achieve group behavior. GNP is a newly developed Evolutionary Computation (EC) technique whose genome is network structure.In this paper, we extend our methodology by allowing agents in the pursuit domain to autonomously learn communication. We consider autonomous and independently learning agents, and we seek to obtain an optimal solution for the team as a whole. We design a novel methodology for the emergence of communication between agents in cooperative multiagent systems based on GNP and we seek to obtain more coordination. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in evolving communicating agents and furthermore a comparison is made between agents with and without communication in order to show that the emergent communication among agents is beneficial Le., improves their coordination. In addition, we show the robustness of generated programs which is achieved as a side-effect of the capability of communication.",,第3页.xls

One of the fundamental challenges of multi-UAV systems is autonomous team coordination. This paper looks at flocking with small fixed-wing UAVs in the context of a model -free reinforcement learning problem. Dyna-Q(lambda) with a variable learning rate is employed by the agents to learn a control policy that facilitates flocking in a leader -follower topology while operating in a stochastic environment. Simulation results demonstrate the followers learning and adapting their policies to non -stationary stochastic environments.",,第3页.xls
999,Learning Complementary Multiagent Behaviors: A Case Study,2010,"As machine learning is applied to increasingly complex tasks, it is likely that the diverse challenges encountered can only be addressed by combining the strengths of different learning algorithms. We examine this aspect of learning through a case study grounded in the robot soccer context. The task we consider is Keepaway, a popular benchmark for multiagent reinforcement learning from the simulation soccer domain. Whereas previous successful results in Keepaway have limited learning to an isolated, infrequent decision that amounts to a turn-taking behavior (passing), we expand the agents' learning capability to include a much more ubiquitous action (moving without the ball, or getting open), such that at any given time, multiple agents are executing learned behaviors simultaneously. We introduce a policy search method for learning GETOPEN to complement the temporal difference learning approach employed for learning PASS. Empirical results indicate that the learned GETOPEN policy matches the best hand-coded policy for this task, and outperforms the best policy found when PASS is learned. We demonstrate that PASS and GETOPEN can be learned simultaneously to realize tightly-coupled soccer team behavior.",,第3页.xls
0,Communication constraints in the average consensus problem,2008,"The interrelationship between control and communication theory is becoming of fundamental importance in many distributed control systems, such as the coordination of a team of autonomous agents. In such a problem, communication constraints impose limits on the achievable control performance. We consider as instance of coordination the consensus problem. The aim of the paper is to characterize the relationship between the amount of information exchanged by the agents and the rate of convergence to the consensus. We show that time-invariant communication networks with circulant symmetries yield slow convergence if the amount of information exchanged by the agents does not scale well with their number. On the other hand, we show that randomly time-varying communication networks allow very fast convergence rates. We also show that by adding logarithmic quantized data links to time-invariant networks with symmetries, control performance significantly improves with little growth of the required communication effort.

1,Multi-agent simulation to implementation: a practical engineering methodology for designing space flight operations,2007,"OCAMS is a practical engineering application of multi-agent systems technology, involving redesign of the tools and practices in a complex, distributed system. OCAMS is designed to assist flight controllers in managing interactions with the file system onboard the International Space Station. The simulation to implementation development methodology combines ethnography, participatory design, multiagent simulation, and agent-based systems integration. We describe the model of existing operations and how it was converted into a future operations simulation that embeds a multiagent tool that automates part of the work. This hybrid simulation flexibly combines actual and simulated systems (e.g., mail) and objects (e.g., files) with simulated people, and is validated with actual data. A middleware infrastructure for agent societies is thus demonstrated in which agents are used to link arbitrary hardware and software systems to distributed teams of people on earth and in space-the first step in developing an interplanetary multiagent system.",,第4页.xls
2,Coordinated CRLB-based Control for Tracking Multiple First Responders in 3D Environments,2020,"In this paper we study the problem of tracking a team of first responders with a fleet of autonomous mobile flying agents, operating in 3D environments. We assume that the first responders exhibit stochastic dynamics and evolve inside challenging environments with obstacles and occlusions. As a result, the mobile agents probabilistically receive noisy line-of-sight (LoS), as well as non-line-of-sight (NLoS) range measurements from the first responders. In this work, we propose a novel estimation (i.e., estimating the position of multiple first responders over time) and control (i.e., controlling the movement of the agents) framework based on the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). More specifically, we analytically derive the CRLB of the measurement likelihood function which we use as a control criterion to select the optimal joint control actions over all agents, thus achieving optimized tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-agent multi-target estimation and control framework is demonstrated through an extensive simulation analysis.",,第4页.xls
3,EMPHASIZING ON THE TIMING AND TYPE Enhancing the Backchannel Performance of Virtual Agent,2012,"Addressing backchannel feedbacks to virtual agent listener gives the agent human-like conversation skills and creates rapport in Human-Computer Interaction. We argue the limitations of current approaches in predicting and generating backchannel. Following two hypotheses emphasizing on the timing and type of backchannel; we introduce an improved system to enhance the agent listener's performance. By using Newcastle Personality Assessor before parasocial consensus sampling and then neural networks, we can obtain the personality rules and select different backchannel timing thresholds for specific it listener according to its own personality. After a context-free perceptual study, we will build two emotional backchannel lexicons showing positive affection and negative affection respectively. In accordance with the empathy strategy, the system will select one type of backchannel from the corresponding emotional backchannel lexicon. The improved system will be more suitable for different conversation occasions and greatly increase the naturalness between the human speaker and the virtual agent listener in the future.",,第4页.xls
4,Evaluation Study and Results of Intelligent Pedagogical Agent-led Learning Scenarios in a Virtual World,2014,"The use of intelligent pedagogical agents (IPAs) has shown to provide positive learning results and new learning possibilities. The IPA has specific importance in immersive learning environments to enable 24/7 availability, offer a learning companion opportunity, and increase learner engagement. In that regard, a proof of concept prototype implementation of an intelligent pedagogical agent (IPA) in the Open Wonderland virtual world environment was created. This paper reports a qualitative evaluation study and experiment performed by a team of six experts in relevant areas of expertise.

8,Evaluating Ad Hoc Teamwork Performance in Drop-In Player Challenges,2017,"Ad hoc teamwork has been introduced as a general challenge for AI and especially multiagent systems [16]. The goal is to enable autonomous agents to band together with previously unknown teammates towards a common goal: collaboration without pre-coordination. A long-term vision for ad hoc teamwork is to enable robots or other autonomous agents to exhibit the sort of flexibility and adaptability on complex tasks that people do, for example when they play games of pick-up basketball or soccer. As a testbed for ad hoc teamwork, autonomous robots have played in pick-up soccer games, called drop-in player challenges, at the international RoboCup competition. An open question is how best to evaluate ad hoc teamwork performancehow well agents are able to coordinate and collaborate with unknown teammatesof agents with different skill levels and abilities competing in drop-in player challenges. This paper presents new metrics for assessing ad hoc teamwork performance, specifically attempting to isolate an agents coordination and teamwork from its skill level, during drop-in player challenges. Additionally, the paper considers how to account for only a relatively small number of pick-up games being played when evaluating drop-in player challenge participants.",,第4页.xls

10,A clinical data repository as an autonomous agent,2005,"In general, hospital information system should provide interoperability hat usually and operate independence of other HIS. This study proposes a new HIS paradigm that can be implemented within standard HL7 interface engine and clinical data repository (CDR). We have developed an alternative architecture relying on agent solutions with distributed queries to heterogeneous databases. This architecture creates a very fine and flexible repository that can handle queries with the bases of standard HL7 messaging structure. Deploying agent solutions to manipulate autonomy of storage management and sociality for communication with open world is another issue that keeps this system from reinventing existing wheels in medical informatics. This study the first attempt to construct CDR based private clinic. We used the information stored in the clinical patient record system of the internal medicine private hospital which is used rational database. We were searched increasing the 1,000 data entry from 1,000 to 10,000. By the result, experimental CDR showed highly efficient performance more than 6,000. In the future, the CDR can be further extended for clinical information among private hospitals estranged from EHR (electronic health records).",,第4页.xls
11,Management of shared data in federated cooperative peer environment,1993,"In a network of autonomous cooperating agents, complex distributed objects can be shared and exchanged. The novel feature presented in this paper is handling complex distributed objects, that we claim to be essential for cooperating teams of engineers e.g. in CIM, and in an environment that supports the integration of a group of expert systems. A model is presented here for the creation, retrieval, and modification of complex objects that are distributed in a federation of cooperating agents. The information that agents are willing to share with others in the federation is uniformly represented as inter-related objects. This defines a distributed object graph that spans over the entire federation of agents. Complex objects form a connected subgraph of this distributed object graph. To support safe cooperation and sharing of complex objects, while preserving agents' autonomy, agents can bilaterally negotiate the access rights and deletion policies on distributed complex objects and when necessary these rights are propagated. Since the access rights are negotiated among agents, and not imposed by a central authority, the autonomy of each agent is fully maintained. To enable application programs to define and retrieve a complex object as a single entity, a linearization mechanism is introduced in the paper. The model described here has been developed as a part of the PEER system. PEER is a federated objectbase, designed and implemented as part of the Archon abstract machine, which provides an environment for the integration of heterogeneous cooperating expert systems.",,第4页.xls

13,Competitive coevolutionary multi-agent systems: the application to mapping and scheduling problems,1997,"A new paradigm for a parallel and distributed evolutionary computation is proposed in this paper. The main idea of the proposed approach is based on considering a given system as a multiagent system with game-theoretic models of interaction between players. For this purpose a model of noncooperative N-person games with limited interaction is considered. Each player in the game has a payoff function and a set of actions. While players compete to maximize their payoffs, we are interested in the global behavior of the team of players, measured by the average payoff received by the team. To evolve a global behavior in the system, we propose three distributed schemes with evaluation of only local fitness functions. The first scheme uses E-learning automata and is compared with two coevolutionary schemes, which we call loosely coupled genetic algorithms and loosely coupled classifier systems, respectively. We present simulation results which indicate that the global behavior in the systems emerges and is achieved in particular by only a local cooperation between players acting without global information about the system. The models of multi-agent systems are applied to develop parallel and distributed algorithms of dynamic mapping and scheduling tasks in parallel computers.",,第4页.xls
14,Decontamination of arbitrary networks using a team of mobile agents with limited visibility,2007,"In this paper, we consider the problem of decontaminating synchronous networks with mobile agents using breadth-first- search (BFS) technique. We consider various networks with different number of home bases to study the relationship between the number of home bases and the mobile agents/steps required to decontaminate. Through experiments, we demonstrate that as the number of home bases increases, the number of mobile agents required decreases in all network topologies considered. We observed that as the number of home bases increases the number of steps taken to decontaminate the network also decreases. The overuse of mobile agents due to the BFS strategy increases with the decrease in the number of contaminated nodes. For synchronous networks, increasing the number of home bases has an impact on the number of mobile agents needed. In particular, we note that this translates to a reduced number of mobile agents required for certain number of home bases.",,第4页.xls

16,Operational Collective Intelligence of Humans and Machines,2024,"We explore the use of aggregative crowdsourced forecasting (ACF) [2,42] as a mechanism to help operationalize collective intelligence of human-machine teams for coordinated actions. We adopt the definition for Collective Intelligence as: A property of groups that emerges from synergies among data-information-knowledge, softwarehardware, and individuals (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities) that enables just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone. [52] Collective Intelligence emerges from new ways of connecting humans and AI to enable decisionadvantage, in part by creating and leveraging additional sources of information that might otherwise not be included. Aggregative crowdsourced forecasting (ACF) is a recent key advancement towards Collective Intelligence wherein predictions (X% probability that Y will happen) and rationales (why I believe it is this probability that X will happen) are elicited independently from a diverse crowd, aggregated, and then used to inform higher-level decision-making. This research asks whether ACF, as a key way to enable Operational Collective Intelligence, could be brought to bear on operational scenarios (i.e., sequences of events with defined agents, components, and interactions) and decision-making, and considers whether such a capability could provide novel operational capabilities to enable new forms of decision-advantage.",,第4页.xls

It is known that formal methods provide a rigorous analysis of the complexity in both design of control and implementation of systems. This article presents an agent-based framework of formal modeling on the design of communication and control strategies of a team of autonomous robotics, to attain the specified tasks in a coordinated manner.

19,An agent-based approach to concurrent cable harness design,1994,"An approach to providing computational support for concurrent design is discussed in the context of an industrial cable harness design problem. Key issues include the development of an architecture that supports collaboration among specialists, the development of hierarchical representations that capture different characteristics of the design, and the decomposition of tasks to achieve a trade-off between efficiency and robustness. An architecture is presented in which the main design tasks are supported by agents-asynchronous and semiautonomous modules that automate routine design tasks and provide specialized interfaces for working on particular aspects of the design. The agent communication and coordination mechanisms permit members of an engineering team to work concurrently, at different levels of detail and on different versions of the design. The design is represented hierarchically, with detailed models maintained by the participating agents. Abstractions of the detailed models, called agent model images, are shared with other agents. In conjunction with the architecture and design representations, issues pertaining to the exchange of information among different views of the design, management of dependencies and constraints, and propagation of design changes are discussed.",,第4页.xls
20,Formation control of multi-agent with diverse delays,2010,"The formation control problem of second-order delayed multi-agent system was analyzed in order to reveal the swarming behavior of mobile agent system. The dynamic team of mobile multiple agents was researched with the hypothesis of the directed interconnected graph with a globally reachable node, and the diverse communication delays during the information transmission and the diverse input delays during the information processing. A control protocol with the diverse communication delays and the diverse input delays was presented by analyzing the movement characteristic of multi-agent system. The frequency feature of the delayed system was analyzed by applying the Laplace's transform of frequency domain. The characteristic equation of closed-loop control system was studied by utilizing the Greshgorin' s disc theorem. The convergence condition to ensure the formation control of the delayed system was obtained based on the generalized Nyquist criterion. The condition was a decentralized condition that only applied the local information of every agent irrespective of the others. The computer simulations showed the validity of the results.",,第4页.xls
21,Mining opponent behavior: a champion of RoboCup Coach Competition,2006,"Opponent modeling is one of the most attractive and practical arenas in multi agent system (MAS) for predicting and identifying the future behaviors of opponent. This paper introduces an approach towards opponent modeling in RoboCup Soccer Coach Simulation. In this scene, an autonomous coach agent is able to identify the weaknesses or patterns of the opponent by analyzing the opponent's past games and advising own players. To gain this goal, we introduce a 3-tier learning architecture. At first, by gathering data from the environment, sequential events of the players are identified. Then the weaknesses or patterns of the opponent are predicted using statistical calculations. Eventually, by comparing the opponent patterns with the rest of team's behavior, a model of the opponent is constructed. According to this architecture, coach models the opponent and to simplify pattern recognition, provides an appropriate strategy to play against the opponent. This structure is tested in RoboCup Soccer Coach Simulation and MRLCoach was the champion at Iran Open 2006.",,第4页.xls
22,"Advances in Human-Automation Collaboration, Coordination and Dynamic Function Allocation",2019,"Effective integration of humans and automation in control systems engineering has been an ongoing effort since the original publication of McRuer's descriptions of human operators in servomechanism systems in 1959. Over the past 60 years, increasing capabilities of automation and computer systems have resulted in changing considerations of function allocation and human-automation interaction since Fitts' Humans are better at / Machines are better at descriptions of the early 1950s. The processes of distributed autonomy and dynamic function allocation in modern human-automation and human-robotic interactions benefit from increased computing capabilities, resulting in systems with potentially fluid (and sometimes conflicting) boundaries for human vs. automation control. Using examples from human and robotic spaceflight, robotics can demonstrate significant autonomy (automated safe-moding and restart by Mars rovers), and humans may have limited autonomy (when astronauts conducting extravehicular activity rely on and wait for ground controllers to create or modify procedures to complete required tasks). Proposed future advances in human-automation interaction and coordination include the development of centaur teams of humans interacting with sophisticated software and robotic agents as team members (rather than fixed allocations as human-controlled servos or automation-controlled autonomous systems). Approaches within the authors' lab include qualitative research of process and cognitive task demands to create functional architecture for AI applications in cyber security. Another method uses agent-based modeling to incorporate individual thinking style and interpersonal interactions in task performance simulations, effectively creating more robust hybrid systems incorporating cognitive and social factors in complex settings.",,第4页.xls

Statistics from the Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) and industry security analysts show that about 80 percent of all malicious activities come from current or former employees. Insider threats have become so critical that organizations have incorporated periodic user access rights audits in their information security policies to be carried out by systems auditors. The potential for fraud exists if system users have excess access rights to IS resources that are not appropriately segregated in line with the specific user's daily roles and responsibilities. Thus, more than ever, one of the prime concerns in any audit for management is the logical access to computer systems and data.",,第4页.xls
24,Immersive training of clinical decision making with AI driven virtual patients - a new VR platform called medical tr.AI.ning.,2023,"Background: Medical students need to be prepared for various situations in clinical decision-making that cannot be systematically trained with real patients without risking their health or integrity. To target system-related limitations of actor-based training, digital learning methods are increasingly used in medical education, with virtual reality (VR)- training seeming to have high potential. Virtually generated training scenarios allow repetitive training of highly relevant clinical skills within a protected, realistic learning environment. Thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI), face-to-face interaction with virtual agents is feasible. Combining this technology with VR-simulations offers a new way of situated context-based, first-person training for medical students.Project goal and method: The authors' aim is to develop a modular digital training platform for medical education with virtual, interactable agents and to integrate this platform into the medical curriculum. The medical tr.AI.ning platform will provide veridical simulation of clinical scenarios with virtual patients, augmented with highly realistic medical pathologies within a customizable, realistic situational context. Medical tr.AI.ning is scaled to four complementary developmental steps with different scenarios that can be used separately and so each outcome can successively be integrated early within the project. Every step has its own focus (visual, movement, communication, combination) and extends an author toolbox through its modularity. The modules of each step will be specified and designed together with medical didactics experts.Perspective: To ensure constant improvement of user experience, realism, and medical validity, the authors will perform regular iterative evaluation rounds.Furthermore, integration of medical tr.AI.ning into the medical curriculum will enable long-term and large-scale detection of benefits and limitations of this approach, providing enhanced alternative teaching paradigms for VR technology.Hintergrund: Medizinstudierende mussen auf verschiedene Situationen in klinischer Entscheidungsfindung vorbereitet werden, die nicht systematisch mit echten Patienten geubt werden konnen, ohne ihre Gesundheit oder Integritat zu gefahrden.

26,Predicting the future state of the robocup simulation environment: Heuristic and neural networks approaches,2003,"One of the challenges in multi-agent systems is the prediction of the future state of the environment. This is because the future behavior of each agent and its relationship with other agents in the environment must be predicted according to an appropriate agent model. Such a prediction about the future of the environment in a large state space, like the Robocup simulation environment, in which most agents act on the basis of uncertain knowledge, is quite hard. Given the above context, a novel multi-agent game presentation and analysis tool has been developed. One of the agents in this tool is responsible for the prediction of individual and team behaviors. To overcome the problem of uncertain knowledge, the prediction is only made for the simulated commentator who needs to anticipate the player agent receiving the ball after a shoot by another player agent. The predictor agent has been implemented both heuristically and with neural networks. Using the logged data form Robocup 2002 simulation league, as our test data, the neural network approach had a higher success rate of true predictions than our heuristic simulation.",,第4页.xls

29,The probabilistic model to represent the behavior of anapplied multi-agent system,2016,"Problems of collective behavior and group management attracted the attention of researchers more than half a century. In recent years their importance has increased significantly due to topical interest to such problems as management of a robot team, flight control and mission accomplishment of groups of unmanned aerial vehicles and other mobile systems. The problems of managing groups of mobile objects, which have to coordinate their behavior in space and to cooperate to achieve a given result, are especially difficult. A sufficiently developed mathematical tool that could be acceptable for behavior control of the system agents in practice has not been fully established by the present time. This work presents an attempt to create the necessary mathematical grounds for a particular class of multi-agent systems, the practical application of which is obvious and needs no comment.The probabilistic model to represent the behavior of an applied multi-agent system that introduces the game interaction between a set of agents and a target has been developed. The agent's behavior is non-deterministic and therefore unpredictable from the target viewpoint. The system allows both coordinated and autonomous agent's behavior that depends on availability of information about the presence and position of workable agents for each other. Agent's behavior is determined with the aid of the algorithm that includes identification of the probabilistic model parameters using maximized objective functions representing individual and group probabilities for target defeating. Both the model and algorithm ensure the behavior control for relevant applied multi-agent systems.",,第4页.xls
30,Mixed Strategies in Combinatorial Agency,2010,"In many multiagent domains a set of agents exert effort towards a joint outcome, yet the individual effort levels cannot be easily observed. A typical example for such a scenario is routing in communication networks, where the sender can only observe whether the packet reached its destination, but often has no information about the actions of the intermediate routers, which influences the final outcome. We study a setting where a principal needs to motivate a team of agents whose combination of hidden efforts stochastically determines an outcome. In a companion paper we devise and study a basic combinatorial agency model for this setting, where the principal is restricted to inducing a pure Nash equilibrium. Here we study various implications of this restriction. First, we show that, in contrast to the case of observable efforts, inducing a mixed-strategies equilibrium may be beneficial for the principal. Second, we present a sufficient condition for technologies for which no gain can be generated. Third, we bound the principal's gain for various families of technologies. Finally, we study the robustness of mixed equilibria to coalitional deviations and the computational hardness of the optimal mixed equilibria.",,第4页.xls

32,A hierarchy of reactive behaviors handles complexity,2001,"This paper discusses the hierarchical control architecture used to generate the behavior of individual agents and a team of robots for the RoboCup Small Size competition. Our reactive approach is based on control layers organized in a temporal hierarchy. Fast and simple behaviors reside on the bottom of the hierarchy, while an increasing number of slower and more complex behaviors are implemented in the higher levels. In our architecture deliberation is not implemented explicitly, but to an external viewer it seems to be present. Each layer is composed of three modules. First, the sensor module, where the perceptual dynamics aggregates the readings of fast changing sensors in time to form complex, slow changing percepts. Next, the activation module computes the activation dynamics that determines whether or not a behavior is allowed to influence actuators, and finally the actuator module, where the active behaviors influence the actuators to match a target dynamics. We illustrate our approach by describing the bottom-up design of behaviors for the RoboCup domain.",,第4页.xls

35,Massive multi-agent data-driven simulations of the GitHub ecosystem [arXiv],2019,"Simulating and predicting planetary-scale techno-social systems poses heavy computational and modeling challenges. The DARPA SocialSim program set the challenge to model the evolution of GitHub, a large collaborative software-development ecosystem, using massive multi-agent simulations. We describe our best performing models and our agent-based simulation framework, which we are currently extending to allow simulating other planetary-scale techno-social systems. The challenge problem measured participant's ability, given 30 months of meta-data on user activity on GitHub, to predict the next months' activity as measured by a broad range of metrics applied to ground truth, using agent-based simulation. The challenge required scaling to a simulation of roughly 3 million agents producing a combined 30 million actions, acting on 6 million repositories with commodity hardware. It was also important to use the data optimally to predict the agent's next moves. We describe the agent framework and the data analysis employed by one of the winning teams in the challenge. Six different agent models were tested based on a variety of machine learning and statistical methods. While no single method proved the most accurate on every metric, the broadly most successful sampled from a stationary probability distribution of actions and repositories for each agent. Two reasons for the success of these agents were their use of a distinct characterization of each agent, and that GitHub users change their behavior relatively slowly.

36,A Tool To Prioritize Code Smell In Distributed Development,2017,"A code smell is a symptom in the source code that helps to identify a design problem. Several tools for detecting and ranking code smells according to their criticality to the system have been developed. However, existing works assume a centralized development approach, which does not consider systems being developed in a distributed fashion. The main problem in a distributed group of developers is that a tool cannot always ensure a global vision of (smells of) the system, and thus inconsistencies among the rankings provided by each developer are likely to happen. These inconsistencies often cause unnecessary refactorings and might not focus the whole team on the critical smells system-wide. Along this line, this work proposes a multi-agent tool, called D-JSpIRIT, which helps individual developers to reach a consensus on their smell rankings by means of distributed optimization techniques.",,第4页.xls
37,On emergence of scalable tactical and strategic behaviour,2001,"The principle of behavioral programming suggests to derive low-level controllers from symbolic high-level task descriptions in a predictable way. This paper presents an extension of the principle of behavioral programming-by identifying a feedback link between emergent behaviour and a scalable deep behaviour projection (DBP) agent architecture. In addition, we introduce a new variant of the RoboCup Synthetic Soccer, called Circular Soccer. This variant simulates matches among multiple teams on a circular field, and extends the RoboCup Simulation towards strategic game-theoretic issues. Importantly, the Circular Soccer world provides a basis for an architecture scale-ability evaluation, and brings us closer to the idea of meta-game simulation.",,第4页.xls
38,Composing and sharing dynamic models in an agent-based concurrent engineering environment,1999,"Sharing design information in a distributed engineering team is a challenging problem. Ideally, the information exchange should be flexible enough to accommodate different levels of abstraction required for different engineering design and analysis tasks. We propose a solution in which specialists, and the programs they use, are modeled as agents who share a common communication language and ontology. The ontology includes both a symbolic representation of the equations describing system behavior and the conditions (such as parameter ranges) over which the model is valid. We use the a hybrid modeling paradigm to generate consistent models at multiple levels of abstraction and demonstrate the approach with design analysis tasks for a stepper motor actuated positioning system.",,第4页.xls
39,Spontaneous Organizations: Collaborative Computing Model of a Networked Organization,2012,"In most real life organizations, actions usually occur irrationally among their members which modify the behaviors of the organizations. As in Occupy Wall Street (OWS), for instance, that starts in 2011, and it was ongoing over more than 600 communities since then. Social movement, as in the OWS, frequently detected to increase the network rapidly. Therefore, our attention in this paper is on social networks among agents and their effects on the organization and the others. We show a study of such a movement that we label as Spontaneous Organization (SO). We illustrate a life cycle of the SO from the formation of it until the dissolution while covering some important concepts that case such a huge viral spreading. We present a method that can be used to assign tasks to the agents inside the organization depending on their level of fitness. A simulation for a small example of the real life that mimics a spontaneous organization will be implemented using NetLogo for further validation.",,第4页.xls
40,Communication and interaction with learning agents in virtual soccer,2000,"This paper presents a learning system based on Artificial Life for the animation of virtual entities. The model uses an extension of a classifiers system to build dynamically the behavior of agents by emergence. A behavior is selected into a set of binary rules that evolves continuously to ensure the maximization of predefined goals. The reinforcement allows to reward a rule and then to evaluate its efficiency faced to a given context. We investigate the interaction between virtual agents and a human controlled clone immersed in virtual soccer. in the simulation, each entity evolves in real-time by using the ability of cooperation and communication with teammates. We evaluate the benefits of the communication inside a team and present how it can improve the learning of a group thanks to a rule-sharing and a human intervention.",,第4页.xls
41,Cooperative validation in distributed control systems design,2007,"The team of engineers designing and implementing distributed control system software must communicate within a multidisciplinary environment. One of the main problems is the interaction between hardware and software solutions. Software project presumptions may not be based only on minimum hardware requirements and on technology rules. Modem distributed control systems embrace all aspects of a complex and widespread object. Hence, every modification within any discipline requires interference into the system and validation of its new features, which in turn constraints effectiveness of designing. This paper discusses how to increase effectiveness and speed up validation, in a standardised CAD environment, by using: Multi-Agent System in order to limit the number of interactions between particular subsystems, ontology for assisting topology description and properties of system entropy for assessment of introduced solutions. The proposed system was implemented and worked out in a biotechnological pilot plant.",,第4页.xls
42,Botnet Statistical Analysis Tool for Limited Resource Computer Emergency Response Team,2009,"Botnet is recognized as one of the fastest growing threat to the Internet and most users do not aware that they were victimized. ThaiCERT is one of many computer emergency response teams that have limited resources in term of budget to monitor and handle this kind of threat. An interim solution for teams with limited resource is to subscribe to the Shadowserver Foundation's mailing list instead of deploying their own capturing and monitoring tools. The valuable information from the Shadowserver Foundation in form of plaintext e-mails may be difficult to manage and analyze. However, there is a need to analyze information provided by the Shadowserver Foundation to be able to efficiently handle botnet's incidents for our own constituency. In this manuscript, we present our approach to handle the botnet threat using available information from the Shadowserver Foundation and describe our automate tool using In, our incident handling team. Finally, we present our statistical data on botnet's threat in our constituency over the last two years.",,第4页.xls

We propose conventions for describing agent actions and interactions, and offer advice for effective use of boundary objects in a group process of building ABMs. We found that 1) an early boundary object was helpful for teaching stakeholders basic ABM concepts; 2) physical correspondence between boundary objects and model interfaces improved participant engagement; 3) group ownership of the model was threatened when the modeling team failed to capture needed model elements through the boundary object; 4) adherence to boundary object conventions improved when participants were given specific charges; 5) with hands-on exposure, the model graphical user interface became an effective boundary object.",,第4页.xls
44,Next generation of methods and tools for team work based care in speech and language therapy,2005,"Speech and language therapists (SLTs) are faced daily with a diversity of speech and language disabilities, which are associated with a variety of conditions ranging from client groups with overall cognitive deficits to those with more specific difficulties. It is desirable that those working with such a range of problems and with such a demanding workload plan care efficiently. Therefore, the introduction of methodologies, reference models of work and tools, which significantly improve the effectiveness of therapy, are particularly welcome. This paper describes a web-based tool for diagnosis, treatment and e-Learning in the field of Language and Speech therapy. The system is an easy to use technology environment. It allows SLTs to find the optimum treatment for each patient, by incorporating different treatment actors. In addition, it also allows any non-specialist user--SLT, patient or helper (relative etc.)--to explore their creativity, by designing their own communication aid in an interactive manner, with the use of editors like: configuration and vocabulary. The system has been tested and piloted by potential users (SLTs and patients) in Greece and UK. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第4页.xls
45,"EISEval, a generic reconfigurable environment for evaluating agent-based interactive systems",2013,"The evaluation of interactive systems has been an active subject of research for many years. Many methods have been proposed, but most of them do not take the architectural specificities of an agent-based interactive system into account, nor do they focus on the link between architecture and evaluation. In this paper, we present an agent-based architecture model for interactive systems. Then, based on this architecture, we propose a generic, reconfigurable evaluation environment, called EISEval, designed and developed to help evaluators analyze and evaluate certain aspects of interactive systems in general and of agent-based architecture interactive systems in particular: User Interface (UI), non-functional properties (e.g., response time, complexity) and user characteristics (e.g., abilities, preferences, progress). System designers can draw useful conclusions from the evaluation results to improve the system. This environment was applied to evaluate an agent-based interactive system used to supervise an urban transport network in a study organized in laboratory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

46,AI-Empowered Policy for Science & Technology Decision Intelligence Developing New Quality Productive Forces for Knowledge Services,2024,"The onset of ChatGPT, Sora, Claude-3, and the like, has brought about the era of AIGC for text, images, and videos. Literature review, scientometric analysis, and S&T trends analysis have also being rapidly taken over by AI tools, thus making traditional knowledge services (KS) falling into a low-quality productivity trap. It is difficult to develop new quality productive forces with competitive vitality and resilience by only using AI to optimize the execution efficiency of traditional KS business logic. AI, as illustrated by Large Language Models (LLM), has broken the reductionist research model that disassembles complex phenomena and systems into individual parts to study and solve, and the turing computing model that pursues deterministic computing, therefore able to handle the dimensional disaster from the combinatorial explosion of complex multi-interactive systems. This helps us to truly take complex problems, dynamic decision conditions, and selective operational solutions as the goal of KS, and provides users with decision intelligence. This may be the starting point in the search for new quality productive forces in KS. But it is imperative to ask what is the real problem from the point of First Principle. Starting from the fundamental needs of decision users of KS, we need to think clearly about what KS should do, can do, and must do. Admittedly, when problems of decision-makers ask for various data or information analysis, what they really need is to answer is not just what is but why is so and what can/should I do in their S&T planning, organizing, resourcing, evaluating, etc., under their specific conditions. If so, KS should now be positioned as a user decision-making productivity service, focusing on Policy for S&T (P4ST), hence transforming KS from the literature-oriented or data-oriented or indicator-oriented to user-problem/solution-oriented models, and from data or computational intelligence to cognitive and decision intelligence. Based on several examples, this paper proposes a generalized decision-making genomic model for AIempowered Policy for Science & Technology (AI4P4ST). The model consists of an Agent axis (multi-levels from individuals to nations), an Action axis (planning, organizing, budgeting, evaluation, etc.), and an Outcome axis (plans, institutions, teams, projects, papers, patents, products, etc.). Use of this model supports intelligent decisionmaking analysis under the dynamics of complex systems. With multiple combinations of variables that interact in known or unknown ways, we can perform multi-modal cross-scale modeling and analysis of multi-dimensional multi-variates, continuously adjusting to approximate possible solutions with quantifiable uncertainties, so that decision-makers can select for a decision. AI4P4ST analysis can progressively implement the P4ST analysis pipelines that supports the dynamics of complex systems. The LLM Prompt Engineering and its many augmented models can be used to build an AI4P4ST Chain of Analyses. In addition, technologies such as AI Agents, Multi-Agents Models, and Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, as well as mechanisms such as LangChain or GPTSwarm, can be employed to support AIenabled application processes that combine multiple LLMs and specialized tools, thus enabling intelligent processes such as planning, prediction, experimentation, verification, and analysis for AI4P4ST. Of course, AI4P4ST still faces challenges from complex data environments and complex social dynamics, including multi-modal heterogeneous data environments, boundary uncertainty, strong game adversariality, difficulties in handling critical states, and weak counterfactual reasoning.",,第4页.xls
47,Object-oriented design processes of electronic commerce in a multi-agent environment,2004,"Corporations are moving from traditional management into a world of agile and electronic business. Such businesses have continually sought to develop information technology (IT) systems, in order to assist in the decision-making of the business process. Due to rapid changes in the business environment this process is subject to ongoing examination. To ensure the agility of electronic commerce, business design process problems must be addressed by a team of specialists or intelligent agents, and be based on object-oriented design, characterized by computability, reusability, and exchangeability. This paper proposes a multi-agent system encompassing an object-oriented approach, to design processes for electronic commerce. This approach entails solutions to design processes, for decision-makers who are geographically separated and operate on differing computer platforms. By combining various objects, different types of design processes can be solved with the same agent-based framework, making this approach very responsive. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world construct that involves combining objects to complete an electronic commerce model: in particular the logistics objective.",,第4页.xls
48,A Generic Model for a Robotic Agent System using GAIA Methodology: Two Distinct Implementations,2010,"The emergence of multi-agent systems in the past years has led to a necessity of developing new methodologies to assist in the requirements and architectural analysis, and in the design phases of such a system, and as a consequence, several Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodologies have been proposed. In this paper, we analyze the GAIA methodology and some proposed extensions, and use this methodology to design an abstract generic system model for an open multi-robot application. We then derive two distinct specific models for two different applications - the first with the intention of using intelligent wheelchairs in a hospital environment, and the second targeting the use of teams of autonomous aircrafts. The successful adoption of the generic model in the design stages of the two distinct systems not only validates the proposed model and shows that it can be used in open multi-agent systems, but also shows it is also flexible enough to be used in systems as diverse as these. By adapting the GAIA methodology for the design of open systems, this work enables designers to model open systems in a faster and simpler form, decreasing the time needed to complete several tasks, while maintaining a high-level overview of the system.",,第4页.xls
49,Analysis of trust in autonomy for convoy operations,2016,"With growing use of automation in civilian and military contexts that engage cooperatively with humans, the operator's level of trust in the automated system is a major factor in determining the efficacy of the human-autonomy teams. Suboptimal levels of human trust in autonomy (TiA) can be detrimental to joint team performance. This mis-calibrated trust can manifest in several ways, such as distrust and complete disuse of the autonomy or complacency, which results in an unsupervised autonomous system. This work investigates human behaviors that may reflect TiA in the context of an automated driving task, with the goal of improving team performance. Subjects performed a simulated leader-follower driving task with an automated driving assistant. The subjects had could choose to engage an automated lane keeping and active cruise control system of varying performance levels. Analysis of the experimental data was performed to identify contextual features of the simulation environment that correlated to instances of automation engagement and disengagement. Furthermore, behaviors that potentially indicate inappropriate TiA levels were identified in the subject trials using estimates of momentary risk and agent performance, as functions of these contextual features. Inter-subject and intra-subject trends in automation usage and performance were also identified. This analysis indicated that for poorer performing automation, TiA decreases with time, while higher performing automation induces less drift toward diminishing usage, and in some cases increases in TiA. Subject use of automation was also found to be largely influenced by course features.",,第4页.xls
50,PRIMAL: Pathfinding via Reinforcement and Imitation Multi-Agent Learning,2019,"Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is an essential component of many large-scale, real-world robot deployments, from aerial swarms to warehouse automation. However, despite the community's continued efforts, most state-of-the-art MAPF planners still rely on centralized planning and scale poorly past a few hundred agents. Such planning approaches are maladapted to real-world deployments, where noise and uncertainty often require paths be recomputed online, which is impossible when planning times are in seconds to minutes. We present PRIMAL, a novel framework for MAPF that combines reinforcement and imitation learning to teach fully decentralized policies, where agents reactively plan paths online in a partially observable world while exhibiting implicit coordination. This framework extends our previous work on distributed learning of collaborative policies by introducing demonstrations of an expert MAPF planner during training, as well as careful reward shaping and environment sampling. Once learned, the resulting policy can be copied onto any number of agents and naturally scales to different team sizes and world dimensions. We present results on randomized worlds with up to 1024 agents and compare success rates against state-of-the-art MAPF planners. Finally, we experimentally validate the learned policies in a hybrid simulation of a factory mockup, involving both real world and simulated robots.",,第4页.xls
51,Efficient Distributed Sensing using Adaptive Censoring based Inference,2013,"In many distributed sensing applications it is likely that only a few agents will have valuable information at any given time. Since wireless communication between agents is resource-intensive, it is important to ensure that the communication effort is focused on communicating valuable information from informative agents. This paper presents communication-efficient distributed sensing algorithms that avoid network cluttering by having only agents with high Value of Information (VoI) broadcast their measurements to the network, while others censor themselves. A novel contribution of the presented distributed estimation algorithm is the use of an adaptively adjusted VoI threshold to determine which agents are informative. This adaptation enables the team to better balance between the communication cost incurred and the long-term accuracy of the estimation. Theoretical results are presented establishing the almost sure convergence of the communication cost and estimation error to zero for distributions in the exponential family. Furthermore, validation through real datasets shows that the new VoI-based algorithms can yield improved parameter estimates than those achieved by previously published hyperparameter consensus algorithms while incurring only a fraction of the communication cost.",,第4页.xls
52,An interactive agent for resource pushing towards Web-based cooperative design,2006,"On the purpose of providing design resources to user with higher precision in cooperative design activity, based on an interactive agent model, the workflow features such as user's role, team, design stage, and other individual information is introduced into resources searching and selected process. First, a resource-based cooperative supported design environment is built as work environment for agent and user. Then, a formalized structure is used to describe user features in interactive agent model. The definition of role, preference, ability description as well as the definition of action, mental state, and other descriptions is included in interactive agent structure. Also a general logical design resource structure is constructed as the basic meta-unit to extract, organize, manage, and operate resources based on analysis of design activity. Therefore, by combining user preference especially some workflow features with design resource feature into resource matching calculation, design resources are pushed to users with more pertinence. A resource-based system has been implemented for a design enterprise. Although the interactive agent still could not act as a user avatar as ideal, it has provided user an easy design environment to re-use resources effectively.",,第4页.xls
53,Manufacturing systems control in printed wiring board assembly using distributed artificial intelligence,1996,"This research used distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) to promote the integration and coordination that is possible in a surface mount printed wiring board assembly facility. The prototype DAI based system helps to provide (near) real-time responses to manufacturing systems engineering related problems. A group of intelligent agents are used to form a problem solving team. This DAI system was developed and implemented on a local area network on which several personal computers are connected, each functioning as an intelligent agent. Object oriented programming concepts were used. Six intelligent agents were used to implement the dynamic production planning task. The planning task is divided into sub-tasks which could be solved by the individual intelligent agents. The communication and cooperation between the intelligent agents is achieved by a blackboard based communication framework. A fuzzy coordination technique was used to resolve conflicts between the solutions generated by the intelligent agents and to negotiate between them.",,第4页.xls
54,Logics of Common Ground,2017,"According to Clark's seminal work on common ground and grounding, participants collaborating in a joint, activity rely on their shared information, known as common ground, to perform that activity successfully, and continually align and augment this information during their collaboration. Similarly, teams of human and artificial agents require common ground to successfully participate in joint activities. Indeed, without appropriate information being shared, using agent autonomy to reduce the workload on humans may actually increase workload as the humans seek to understand why the stems are behaving as they are. While many researchers have identified the importance of common ground in artificial intelligence, there is no precise definition of common ground on which to build the foundational aspects of multi-agent collaboration. In this paper, building previously-defined model logics of belief, we present logic definitions for four different We define modal logics for three existing notions of common ground and introduce a new notion of common ground, called salient common. ground. Salient common ground captures the common ground of a group participating in an activity and is based on the common ground that arises from that activity as well as on the common ground they shared prior to the activity. We show that the four definitions,share some properties, and our analysis suggests possible refinements of the existing informal and semi-formal definitions.",,第4页.xls
55,An Environment for Combinatorial Experiments in a Multi-agent Simulation for Disaster Response,2018,"We present a research environment for combinatorial experiments for the RoboCupRescue Simulation, which is a platform for the study of disaster-relief strategies using multi-agent simulations. To simulate the agents in disaster-relief situations in the RoboCupRescue Simulation, it is necessary to implement a wide variety of algorithms for tasks such as such as group formation, path planning, and task allocation. Recently, we proposed a modular framework, the Agent Development Framework, that enables researchers to implement, study, and test each algorithm independently. Because the algorithms developed in this framework are mutually replaceable, it is possible to combine algorithms developed by different researchers. In this study, we further propose an experimental environment to efficiently handle the experiments of a huge number of possible combinations of the algorithms. As a demonstration, we test various combinations of the algorithms developed by the participants of RoboCup 2017 and show that there indeed exists a set of the algorithms that is superior to the original ones developed by each team.",,第4页.xls
56,The effects of generalized reciprocal exchange on the resilience of social networks: an example from the prehispanic Mesa Verde region,2003,"The initial version of the model used in this study, Village 1.0, was implemented by Tim Kohler and a team of developers mostly from Washington State University. The original model addressed environmental constraints only and did not attempt to model social interaction. In a recent paper we employed cultural algorithms as a framework in which to add selected social considerations. In this paper we extend our previous model by adding the ability of agents to perform symmetrically initiated or asymmetrically initiated generalized reciprocal exchange. We have developed a state model for agents' knowledge and, given agents' different responses based on this knowledge. Experiments have shown that the network structure of the systems without reciprocity was the simplest but least resilient. As we allowed agents more opportunities to exchange resources we produced more complex network structures, larger populations, and more resilient systems. Furthermore, allowing the agents to buffer their requests by using a finite state model improved the relative resilience of these larger systems. Introducing reciprocity that can be triggered by both requestors and donors produced the largest number of successful donations. This represents the synergy produced by using the information from two complementary situations within the network. Thus, the network has more information with which it can work and tended to be more resilient than otherwise.",,第4页.xls
57,Distributed schema management in a cooperation network of autonomous agents,1993,"For data-intensive, computation-intensive, collaborative engineering application environments such as computer-integrated manufacturing, a natural architecture is a network of loosely-coupled, autonomous, and heterogeneous agents, where each agent runs on a single workstation. Each agent is autonomous in its decision to keep a part of its information private or to share information with other agents. Loose and tight interdependencies among the agents' information can be defined through the integration and interrelation of agent schemas. Complex derivation/integration of agent schemas and their referential integrities can be supported by a schema management mechanism. This facility, which is essential for cooperating teams in industrial automation applications, is the novel feature presented in this paper. The integrated schema created locally at each agent is a coherent view on the local and the global information accessible by this agent. Hence, the physical and logical distribution of information through the network is entirely hidden from the end user of the network and absent from their queries. The schema management mechanism supports the definition of complex derived types and derived mappings, remote referencing among information stored in various agents, and their referential integrities. The schema management mechanism described is a part of PEER. PEER is part of the Archon abstract machine, which provides an environment for the integration of heterogeneous cooperating expert systems.",,第4页.xls
58,Agent-based support for balancing teleoperation and autonomy in urban search and rescue,2006,"Today's artificial intelligence technology is insufficient to support autonomous task performance in complex domains such as urban search and rescue, forcing extensive reliance on human teleoperation of robots. This, however, also has problems: humans quickly suffer from cognitive overload and have difficulties in constructing a representation of the space around a remotely placed robot. In this paper we describe an approach to multirobot control for such environments that focuses on combining the limited abilities of modern autonomous control systems together with human control. At the centre of this approach is a pair of software agents running on each robot: one to recognize problems in the environment from the perspective of a robot, and another to mediate the interaction between a robot and a human controller. The intent of this approach is to allow a human to better control a team of robots, being interrupted only when the situation demands. We describe the implementation of this approach using simulated Pioneer robots, and evaluate the approach in comparison to autonomous and teleoperated mobile robots in a rescue domain.",,第4页.xls
59,Psychological responses to simulated displays of mismatched emotional expressions,2008,"Embodied agents are often designed with the ability to simulate human emotion. This paper investigates the psychological impact of simulated emotional expressions on computer users with a particular emphasis on how mismatched facial and audio expressions are perceived (e.g. a happy face with a concerned voice). In a within-subjects repeated measures experiment (N = 68), mismatched animations were perceived as more engaging, warm, concerned and happy when a happy or warm face was in the animation (as opposed to a neutral or concerned face) and when a happy or warm voice was in the animation (as opposed to a neutral or concerned voice). The results appear to follow cognitive dissonance theory as subjects attempted to make mismatched expressions consistent on both the visual and audio dimensions of animations, resulting in confused perceptions of the emotional expressions. Design implications for affective embodied agents are discussed and future research areas identified. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls
60,Motion synchronization in unmanned aircrafts formation control with communication delays,2013,"This paper proposes a formation control strategy for unmanned aircrafts using a virtual structure. Cross coupled sliding mode controllers are introduced to cope with uncertainties in the attitude measurement systems of the unmanned aircrafts and unmeasurable bounded external disturbances such as wind effects, and also to provide motion synchronization in the multi-agent system. This motion synchronization strategy improves the agents convergence to their desired positions, and this is useful for a multi-agent system with faulty agents.Moreover, the proposed motion synchronization strategy is not restricted to specific communication topologies, and sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the multi-agent system stability in the presence of communication delays. Numerical simulations are presented for a team of five unmanned aircrafts to make a pentagon formation and confirm the accepted performance of the proposed control strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

61,Guiding swarm behavior by soft control,2018,"Guiding swarm behavior is one of important problems in the area of swarm intelligence. While in many multiagent systems, the local rules for each agent is difficult or impossible to be redesigned. Even for artificial systems, it is not easy to design simple local rules for each agent which can lead the group emerge desired collective behavior. In this chapter, we introduce a new method called Soft Control which does not need to change the underlying local rules of agents, but to add some special agents, called shills which can be controlled by us, into the system. It is a nondestructive intervention method because shills are still treated as normal agents by normal ones. The soft-control method is effectively applied to three different multiagent system models to guide the swarm behavior: (1) guide consensus of a Vicsek-like flocking model by adding one intelligent shill, (2) promote cooperation for a group of players that play the end-unknown repeated prisoners dilemma game by adding a cooperating team of shill plays and (3) add one or some shills to guide the collective opinion of the DeGroot model system.",,第4页.xls
62,"Agents supporting humans and organizations in open, dynamic environments",2002,"Summary form only given. The presence of the digital infosphere and the continuous growth of e-commerce have generated important shifts in the ways people and organizations get information and make decisions. These shifts necessitate increased automation and creation of infrastructure, standards and policies to enable machines to automatically access information, understand it, fuse it as needed, and engage in collaborative problem solving to support decision making. Fulfilling such goals presents many challenges, including semantic interoperability, agent-based collaboration, information customization, automated and flexible service discovery and transactions across the Internet. Services are discovered and invoked manually by human users. In the near future, such service discovery and use will be mediated by agents acting on behalf of humans. This opens the possibilities for agents and humans to be team partners and coordinate sharing information, responsibility and control according to the task requirements. There are many challenges to accomplish such collaboration. A crucial one is making the Web agent-understandable, i.e. allowing for semantic annotation of content. The combination of the semantic Web and agent technology is the harbinger of the next Web revolution. Instead of being populated only with human-readable documents, the Web will be populated with agent-mediated services. In addition, agents will support human decision-making and human institutions through autonomous interactions, such as negotiations, coalition formation, and agent-mediated markets. In the Laboratory of Advanced Agent Technology at Carnegie Mellon University, the author has been developing multiagent infrastructure, tools, and algorithms that comprise a Reusable Environment of Task-Structured Intelligent Networked Agents (RETSINA). This infrastructure can be used for developing distributed heterogeneous intelligent agents that interact in various ways including a peer-to-peer manner, as well as agent-mediated services that describe themselves in semantically meaningful ways, discover one another dynamically, interoperate and compose themselves on-the-fly and on-demand, given particular tasks and goals to be fulfilled. This infrastructure has been used to support humans and organizations in open and dynamic environments, where information sources, agents and communication links may appear and disappear dynamically. The developed multiagent applications range from financial portfolio management, to distributed crisis action planning, team coordination, reactive and anticipatory assistance, location-based collaboration and e-commerce. She gives an overview of agent research and presents current research results and future challenges. Up until now, this vision has been conceived and pursued mainly in academia and research labs. However, recent industrial interest in flexible interoperable automated transactions, Web services, and the availability of tools to enable some form of service automation (e.g. UDDI, WSDL, X-lang, WSFL, e-speak, NET, etc.) holds the promise of fast progress in this area.",,第4页.xls
63,"Agent-based architectural framework enhancing configurability, autonomy and scalability of context-aware pervasive services",2010,"Multi-agent software architectures have gained in popularity due to their beneficial behavior in designing and implementing sophisticated applications. However, current approaches in implementing such architectures have led to application-specific, non-scalable implementations which limit the reusablity and improvement of the whole architecture. Moreover, these attempts lack features to enhance the user experience, thus slowing the adoption of the resulting services. In this paper we describe a fully-fledged multi-agent architecture covering a large variety of preferred features including capabilities of 'plugging' ubiquitous services, servicing mobile users, interconnecting remote similar architectures and interfacing with advanced software components such as knowledge bases. This framework exploits a wide-range of context-aware components making it essentially context-aware, allowing for the development of ubiquitous context-aware human-centric services, which are the focus of our research. To illustrate the flexibility of this architectural framework, we present four services which were built using this architectural paradigm by different development teams and elaborate on their overall behavior.",,第4页.xls
64,Unlocking Organizational Potential: A Computational Platform for Investigating Structural Interdependence in Design,2009,"A team's design-the structuring of its resources and flows of knowledge-is an important element determining its effectiveness. An essential element in achieving a team's problem-solving potential is the role that interdependence, in both the task and the organization, plays in determining the dynamic and emergent system-level properties of the organization. In this paper, we present a computational platform for experimentally investigating the influence of informational dependencies found in the design of a complex system for exploring their role in determining system behaviors and performance. The approach presented in this paper is a multiagent simulation of the conceptual design of space mission plans by Team X, an advanced project design group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The algorithm is composed of rich descriptive models of both the team-types and timing of interactions, collaborative methods, sequencing, rates of convergence- and the task-primary variables, their behaviors and relations, and the approaches used to resolve them. The objective is to create an environment of interaction representative of that found in actual design sessions. Better understanding how the dynamics arising from organizational and domain interdependencies impact an organization's ability to effectively resolve its task should lead to the development of guidelines for better coping with task complexities, suggest ways to better design organizations, as well as suggest ways for improving the search for innovative solutions.",,第4页.xls
65,Blast those sequences: a Gridified framework for bioinformatics blast using the A3pviGrid,2008,"Probably the single most important concern of the biotechnology industry is to improve existing biotechnology applications and tools due to the exponential increase in the size of the datasets. Improving application specific performance, pertaining to sudden and dynamic changes in the execution environment has been a widely researched problem. This research was undertaken to find application specific performance problems in the field of applied Bioinformatics. We specifically narrow down on an important everyday bioinformatics application namely Blast, used commonly by biologists for everyday research. A detailed literature study was undertaken to observe the gaps specific to the applications performance subjected to different quality of service constraints and system specific parameters under the confluence of a dynamic mini grid test bed. A number of gaps were identified; throughput in terms of latency (message passing); scalability (load balancing) and application performance (reliability) needs to be addressed. An experimental mini grid test bed was implemented to simulate various conditions and to test the proposed hypotheses. The implemented architecture utilizes game theoretic optimization and agent based team formation (Coalition) algorithms to improve upon scalability with respect to team formation. Due to the dynamic nature of distributed systems (as discussed in previous works) all interactions are made local within a team transparently. This paper is a proof of concept of an experimental mini-Grid test-bed aimed at improving performances of bioinformatics Blast application in terms of scalability and stability. Experimental results and detailed literature on current approaches are explored to conduct a set of generic experiments to validate our claims.",,第4页.xls
66,Distributed Formation Stabilization Using Relative Position Measurements in Local Coordinates,2016,"In this paper, we present a novel distributed method to stabilize a set of agents moving in a two dimensional environment to a desired rigid formation. In our approach, each agent computes its control input using the relative positions of a set of formation neighbors but, contrary to most existing works, this information is expressed in the agent's own independent local coordinate frame, without requiring any common reference. The controller is based on the minimization of a Lyapunov function that includes locally computed rotation matrices, which are required due to the absence of a common orientation. Our contribution is that the proposed distributed coordinate-free method achieves global stabilization to a rigid formation with the agents using only partial information of the team, does not require any leader units, and is applicable to both single-integrator or unicycle agents. To guarantee global stability, we require that the network induced by the agent interactions belongs to a certain class of undirected rigid graphs in two dimensions, which we explicitly characterize. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated with numerical simulations.",,第4页.xls
67,Towards Better Crisis Management in Support Services Organizations Using Fine Grained Agent Based Simulation,2016,"Critical support service operations have to run 24 x 7 and 365 days a year. Support operations therefore do contingency planning to continue operations during a crisis. In this paper we explore the use of fine-grained agent-based simulation models, which factor in human-behavioral dimensions such as stress, as a means to do better people planning for such situations. We believe the use of this approach may allow support operations managers to do more nuanced planning leading to higher resilience, and quicker return to normalcy. We model a prototypical support operation, which runs into different crisis severity levels, and show for each case, a reasonable size of the crisis team that would be required. We identify two contributions in this paper: First, emergency planning using agent based simulations have mostly focused, naturally, on societal communities such as urban populations. There has not been much attention paid to study crisis responses within support services organizations and our work is an attempt to address this deficit. Second, our use of grounded behavioral elements in our agent models allows us to build complex human behavior into the agents without sacrificing validity.",,第4页.xls
68,"Stay back, clever thing! Linking situational control and human uniqueness concerns to the aversion against autonomous technology",2019,"As artificial intelligence advances towards unprecedented levels of competence, people's acceptance of autonomous technology has become a hot topic among psychology and HCI scholars. Previous studies suggest that threat perceptionsregarding observers' immediate physical safety (proximal) as well as their more abstract concepts of human uniqueness (distal)impede the positive reception of self-controlled digital systems. Developing a Model of Autonomous Technology Threat, we propose both of these threat forms as common antecedents of users' general threat experience, which ultimately predicts reduced technology acceptance. In a laboratory study, 125 participants were invited to interact with a virtual reality agent, assuming it to be the embodiment of a fully autonomous personality assessment system. In a path analysis, we found correlational support for the proposed model, as both situational control and human uniqueness attitudes predicted threat experience, which in turn connected to stronger aversion against the presented system. Other potential state and trait influences are discussed. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第4页.xls
69,Coalition formation: From software agents to robots,2007,"A problem that has recently attracted the attention of the research community is the autonomous formation of robot teams to perform complex multirobot tasks. The corresponding problem for software agents is also known in the multi-agent community as the coalition formation problem. Numerous algorithms for software agent coalition formation have been provided that allow for efficient cooperation in both competitive and cooperative environments. However, despite the plethora of relevant literature on the software agent coalition formation problem, and the existence of similar problems in theoretical computer science, the multirobot coalition formation problem has not been sufficiently grounded for different tasks and task environments. In this paper, comparisons are drawn to highlight the differences between software agents and robotics, and parallel problems from theoretical computer science are identified. This paper further explores robot coalition formation in different practical robotic environments. A heuristic-based coalition formation algorithm from our previous work was extended to operate in precedence ordered cooperative environments. In order to explore coalition formation in competitive environments, the paper also studies the RACHNA system, a market based coalition formation system. Finally, the paper investigates the notion of task preemption for complex multi-robot tasks in random allocation environments.",,第4页.xls
70,Intelligent agent support for collaborative engineering design,2001,"Engineering designing is a multifaceted, multidisciplinary activity requiring timely and transparent access to, and exchange of, accurate, pertinent data, information and knowledge. The provision of intelligent computational support for engineering designing has resulted in the development of numerous models, architectures and systems. In organisational terms however, the literature indicates the existence of philosophical-implementational discrepancy between extant computational solutions and the concurrent engineering philosophy. This paper presents an overview of: (i) an agent-based model (the Holonic, Heterarchical, Agent-based, Engineering Designing Model - HHABEDM); (ii) a corresponding architecture (HHABEDA); and (iii) an implemented proof-of-concept prototype system (HHABEDS) for collaborative engineering designing which, it is claimed, redresses this discrepancy.",,第4页.xls
71,Multiagent-Based Allocation of Complex Tasks in Social Networks,2015,"In many social networks (SNs), social individuals often need to work together to accomplish a complex task (e.g., software product development). In the context of SNs, due to the presence of social connections, complex task allocation must achieve satisfactory social effectiveness; in other words, each complex task should be allocated to socially close individuals to enable them to communicate and collaborate effectively. Although several approaches have been proposed to tackle this so-called social task allocation problem, they either suffer from being centralized or ignore the objective of maximizing the social effectiveness. In this paper, we present a distributed multiagent-based task allocation model by dispatching a mobile and cooperative agent to each subtask of each complex task, which also addresses the objective of social effectiveness maximization. With respect to mobility, each agent can transport itself to a suitable individual that has the relevant capability. With respect to cooperativeness, agents can cooperate with each other by forming teams and moving to a suitable individual jointly if the cooperation is beneficial. Our theoretical analyses provide provable performance guarantees of this model. We also apply this model in a set of static and dynamic network settings to investigate its effectiveness, scalability, and robustness. Through experimental results, our model is determined to be effective in improving the system load balance and social effectiveness; this model is scalable in reducing the computation time and is robust in adapting the system dynamics.",,第4页.xls
72,Conversational Agents for Insurance Companies: From Theory to Practice,2019,"Advances in artificial intelligence have renewed interest in conversational agents. Additionally to software developers, today all kinds of employees show interest in new technologies and their possible applications for customers. German insurance companies generally are interested in improving their customer service and digitizing their business processes. In this work we investigate the potential use of conversational agents in insurance companies theoretically by determining which classes of agents exist which are of interest to insurance companies, finding relevant use cases and requirements. We add two practical parts: First we develop a showcase prototype for an exemplary insurance scenario in claim management. Additionally in a second step, we create a prototype focusing on customer service in a chatbot hackathon, fostering innovation in interdisciplinary teams. In this work, we describe the results of both prototypes in detail. We evaluate both chatbots defining criteria for both settings in detail and compare the results and draw conclusions for the maturity of chatbot technology for practical use, describing the opportunities and challenges companies, especially small and medium enterprises, face.",,第4页.xls
73,Distributed planning algorithm for coalition logistics in semi-trusted environment,2006,"We present a collective approach to coalition logistics planning that presents the features crucial for application in an adversarial environment: planning and communication efficiency, well-defined levels of information to be shared, tight integration of trustfulness with the planning and stability with respect to imprecise trustfulness values. To achieve this goal, we combine multi-agent negotiation with efficient fuzzy and flexible linear programming techniques from operation research field. Alternating rounds of global optimization and restricted negotiation split the task into sub-tasks, create teams, assign them to the tasks and provide a task-resource mapping. Resulting plan execution can be easily verified and verification results can be used to update the trust and social models and potentially to perform re-planning immediately.",,第4页.xls
74,Compacting and Grouping Mobile Agents on Dynamic Rings,2019,"We consider computations by a distributed team of autonomous mobile agents that move on an unoriented dynamic ring network. In particular, we consider 1-interval connected dynamic rings (i.e. at any time, at most one of the edges might be missing). The agents move according to a Look-Compute-Move life cycle, under a synchronous scheduler. The agents may be homogenous (thus identical and monochromatic) or they may be heterogenous (distinct agents have distinct colors from a set of c >= 1 colors). For monochromatic agents starting from any dispersed configuration we want the agents to form a compact segment, where agents occupy a continuous part of the ring and no two agents are on the same node - we call this the Compact Configuration Problem. In the case of multiple colors (c > 1), agents of the same color are required to occupy continuous segments, such that agents having the same color are all grouped together, while agents of distinct colors are separated. These formation problems are different from the classical and well studied problem of Gathering all agents at a node, since unlike the gathering problem, we do not allow collisions (each node may host at most one agent of a color). We study these two problems and determine the necessary conditions for solving the problems. For all solvable cases, we provide algorithms for both the monochromatic and the colored version of the compact configuration problem, allowing for at most one intersection between the colored segments (which cannot be avoided in a dynamic ring). All our algorithms work even for the simplest model where agents have no persistent memory, no communication capabilities and do not agree on a common orientation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work on the compaction problem in any type of dynamic network.",,第4页.xls
75,Colearning in differential games,1998,"Game playing has been a popular problem area for research in artificial intelligence and machine learning for many years. In almost every study of game playing and machine learning, the focus has been on games with a finite set of states and a finite set of actions. Further, most of this research has focused on a single player or team learning how to play against another player or team that is applying a fixed strategy for playing the game. We explore multiagent learning in the context of game playing and develop algorithms for colearning in which all players attempt to learn their optimal strategies simultaneously. Specifically, we address two approaches to colearning, demonstrating strong performance by a memory-based reinforcement learner and comparable but faster performance with a tree-based reinforcement learner.",,第4页.xls

We cast this problem in a probabilistic game-theoretic framework and consider two computationally feasible pursuit policies: greedy and global-max. We implement this scenario on a fleet of UGVs and UAVs by using a distributed hierarchical system architecture. Finally, we present both simulation and experimental results that evaluate the pursuit policies relating expected capture times to the speed and intelligence of the evaders and the sensing capabilities of the pursuers.",,第4页.xls
77,A component based implementation of agents and brokers for design coordination,2001,"NASA's mission design coordination has been based on expert opinion of parametric data presented in Excel or PowerPoint. Common access is required to more powerful design tools supporting performance simulation and analysis. Components provide the means for inexpensively adding the desired functionality,.An information exchange was developed to provide the physical models required to perform performance analysis of mission designs. The exchange product is continuous polymorphic model data over finite time intervals. Using Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) components, information brokers were developed to provide controlled access to the products. Each access is a persistent contextual transaction specific to a design team.Information agent Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) were developed to translate information requests, search among the brokers, retrieve the exchange products and ultimately generate high level model information such as state or attitude. An in-process dual component interface was developed to provide direct access from off-ice productivity tools to the agent DLLs.",,第4页.xls
78,Analysis of multi-agent activity using petri nets,2010,This paper presents the use of place/transition petri nets (PNs) for the recognition and evaluation of complex multi-agent activities. The PNs were built automatically from the activity templates that are routinely used by experts to encode domain-specific knowledge. The PNs were built in such a way that they encoded the complex temporal relations between the individual activity actions. We extended the original PN formalism to handle the propagation of evidence using net tokens. The evaluation of the spatial and temporal properties of the actions was carried out using trajectory-based action detectors and probabilistic models of the action durations. The presented approach was evaluated using several examples of real basketball activities. The obtained experimental results suggest that this approach can be used to determine the type of activity that a team has performed as well as the stage at which the activity ended.

79,Requirements elicitation for agent-based applications,2006,"Requirements Elicitation for a software system is a key stage in a successful development. At the same time, it is one of the most challenging, because requirements have to consider the mutual influences between the envisioned system and the human context where it will work. These influences cover aspects such as organization, motivation, evolution, and cognition, taking place in a specific setting. The agent paradigm facilitates the analysis of these features because of its intentional and social nature. Nevertheless, determining the information that should be obtained and the way it should be modelled is not a trivial task. Developers are experts in software systems but they are not always familiarized with the concrete domain of those systems. The Requirements Elicitation Guide, a technique based on the Activity Theory from Social Sciences, can be applied to support developers in these issues. This guide empowers the development team with the experience of Social Sciences in these issues. This paper introduces the guide and shows its application in a case study about a web application.",,第4页.xls
80,Special issue on ontologies and standards for intelligent systems: editorial,2022,"Day by day, new intelligent systems and autonomous machines are being developed to help and assist humans in a myriad of activities ranging from smart manufacturing to smart cities. Such new-generation intelligent systems need to work in teams and communicate with humans and other agents/robots to share information and coordinate activities. Furthermore, there is an increasing demand from government agencies and the private sector alike to use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for tasks including search and rescue, surveillance, and monitoring. As these intelligent systems have to interact with humans in several scenarios involving multi-agent collaboration, data collection, and decision-making, it is urgent to discuss the technical as well as the ethical aspects in their design and function. Hence, ontology-based models for this Robotics and Automation (R&A) domain have the potential to enable a clear communication among the different intelligent systems and stakeholders, the formulations of standards, and the building of AI-based and robotics systems with full alignment with what stakeholders expect from these intelligent systems, in terms of economical benefits and enhanced human well-being.",,第4页.xls

A team of mobile agents called searchers starts at an arbitrary node of an unknown network. Their goal is to execute a search strategy that guarantees capturing a fast and invisible intruder regardless of its movements using as few searchers as possible. As a way of modeling two-dimensional shapes, we restrict our attention to networks that are embedded into partial grids: nodes are placed on the plane at integer coordinates and only nodes at distance one can be adjacent. We give an on-line algorithm for the searchers that allows them to compute a connected and monotone strategy that guarantees searching any unknown partial grid with the use of O(n) searchers, where n is the number of nodes in the grid. We prove also a lower bound of Omega(n/ log n) in terms of achievable competitive ratio of any on-line algorithm.",,第4页.xls

86,The threat from within [data security],2005,"Malicious insiders represent today's toughest challenge for security architects. Traditional database security tools are rendered useless by the trusted employee who has the right credentials. Enterprises are under increasing regulatory and market pressure to protect sensitive information. The only solution to this problem is vigilance. Security and data centre teams implement and enforce best practices to address insider threat. IT architects support and strengthen the policies by using access control, auditing, and other security features built into all major database platforms. Database intrusion detection systems (IDS) examine the behavior of authorized users. Architects must take the advantage of third party monitoring systems which alleviate the need for databases to engage their own auditing functions which can sap processing and disk resources. However, given the fact that the network based monitoring systems can miss the activity of any user who logs in directly to the database, several third party vendors have to include agents as part of their solution.",,第4页.xls

In this paper, the model is particularly used to explore the therapeutic effectiveness of two drugs that target the tumor vasculature: angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs) and vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). Using sensitivity analyses, the impact of VDA dosing parameters is explored, as is the effects of administering a VDA with an AI.

91,Hidden Markov modeling of team-play synchronization,2004,"Imitation Learning is considered both as a method to acquire complex human and agent behaviors, and as a way to provide seeds for further learning. However, it is not clear what is a building block in imitation learning and what is the interface of blocks; therefore, it is difficult to apply imitation learning in a constructive way. This paper addresses agents' intentions as the building block that abstracts local situations of the agent and proposes a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HMM) in order to tackle this issue. The key of the proposed model is introduction of gate probabilities that restrict transition among agents' intentions according to others' intentions. Using these probabilities, the framework can control transitions flexibly among basic behaviors in a cooperative behavior. A learning method for the framework can be derived based on Baum-Welch's algorithm, which enables learning by observation of mentors' demonstration. Imitation learning by the proposed method can generalize behaviors from even one demonstration, because the mentors' behaviors are expressed as a distributed representation of a flow of likelihood in HMM.",,第4页.xls
92,Learning the Point Gathering Task Using Shared Value Function in Mobile Robots,2009,"Managing the actions of several agents to perform tasks which require coordination and cooperation pose significant research challenges. One such challenge is to synchronize the agents' view of the system to help them take the 'right' actions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called MRCPG (Mobile Robot Coordination Point Gathering Algorithm) for coordinating the actions of a team of mobile robots. The aim is to gather these robots at a particular location in a 2-dimensional plane which is determined during execution. The robots are randomly deployed in the plane and they achieve the goal by communicating periodically. In addition, we impose a Reinforcement Learning framework and the robots learn a Shared Value Function (SVF) based on scalar rewards received. The SVF is used to select the best possible action in each state until at least one robot reaches the goal. Then a Reach-distance heuristic is used to direct the remaining robots to the goal. The algorithm was analyzed through simulations for up to 5 robots and the analysis indicates that communication helped robots perform significantly faster than when they acted independently - measured using the path-length of the first robot to reach the goal as the metric. We also observed that increasing team size enhances the effect of communication and hastens task completion.",,第4页.xls

94,Decentralized Bayesian learning in dynamic games [arXiv],2016,"We study the problem of decentralized Bayesian learning in a dynamical system involving strategic agents with asymmetric information. In a series of seminal papers in the literature, this problem has been studied under a simplifying model where selfish players appear sequentially and act once in the game, based on private noisy observations of the system state and public observation of past players' actions. It is shown that there exist information cascades where users discard their private information and mimic the action of their predecessor. In this paper, we provide a framework for studying Bayesian learning dynamics in a more general setting than the one described above. In particular, our model incorporates cases where players participate for the whole duration of the game, and cases where an endogenous process selects which subset of players will act at each time instance. The proposed methodology hinges on a sequential decomposition for finding perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) of a general class of dynamic games with asymmetric information, where user-specific states evolve as conditionally independent Markov process and users make independent noisy observations of their states. Using our methodology, we study a specific dynamic learning model where players make decisions about investing in the team, based on their estimates of everyone's types. We characterize a set of informational cascades for this problem where learning stops for the team as a whole.",,第4页.xls

The overwhelming ability of ball-handling and passing allows ZJUNlict to greatly threaten its opponent and almost kept its goal clear without being threatened. This paper presents the core technology of its ball-handling and robot movement which consist of hardware optimization, dynamic passing and shooting strategy, and multi-agent cooperation and formation. We first describe the mechanical optimization on the placement of the capacitors, the redesign of the damping system of the dribbler and the electrical optimization on the replacement of the core chip. We then describe our passing point algorithm. The passing and shooting strategy can be separated into two different parts, where we search the passing point on SBIP-DPPS and evaluate the point based on the ball model. The statements and the conclusion should be supported by the performances and log of games on Small Size League RoboCup 2019.",,第4页.xls
98,Matching Observed with Empirical Reality - What you see is what you get?,2014,"This paper outlines the primary steps to investigate if artificial agents can be considered as true substitutes of humans. Based on a Socially augmented microworld (SAM) human tracking behavior was analyzed using time series. SAM involves a team of navigators jointly steering a driving object along different virtual tracks containing obstacles and forks. Speed and deviances from track are logged, producing high-resolution time series of individual (training) and cooperative tracking behavior. In the current study 52 time series of individual tracking behavior on training tracks were clustered according to different similarity measures. Resulting clusters were used to predict cooperative tracking behavior in fork situations. Results showed that prediction was well for tracking behavior shown at the first and, moderately well at the third fork of the cooperative track: navigators switched from their trained to a different tracking style and then back to their trained behavior. This matches with earlier identified navigator types, which were identified on visual examination. Our findings on navigator types will serve as a basis for the development of artificial agents, which can be compared later to behavior of human navigators.",,第4页.xls
99,Terrain coverage with ant robots: A simulation study,2001,"In this paper, we study a simple means for coordinating teams of simple agents. In particular, we study ant robots and how they can cover terrain once or repeatedly by leaving markings in the terrain, similar to what ants do. These markings can be sensed by all robots and allow them to cover terrain even if they do not communicate with each other except via the markings, do not have any kind of memory, do not know the terrain, cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths. The robots do not even need to be localized, which completely eliminates solving difficult and time-consuming localization problems. In this paper, we use real-time heuristic search methods to implement ant robots and present a simulation study with several real-time heuristic search methods to study their properties for terrain coverage. Our experiments show that all of the realtime heuristic search methods robustly cover terrain even if the robots are moved without realizing this, some robots fail, and some markings get destroyed. These results demonstrate that terrain coverage with real-time heuristic search methods is an interesting alternative to more conventional terrain coverage methods.",,第4页.xls

101,People-Oriented Programming: From Agent-Oriented Analysis to the Design of Interactive Systems,2009,"Where the Object-Oriented paradigm set about abstracting objects, Agent-Oriented (AO) theory draws on Psychology to abstract mentalist notions like: beliefs, perceptions, goals, and intentions. As such, the associated Agent-Oriented analysis can be used quite successfully to design interactive systems for people, delivering applications that are heavily individual-oriented. This reversal of the AO lens focuses analysis back upon people. It puts a multi-faceted agent used in analysis 'into the shoes' of the user and turns the design and implementation into one we call People-Oriented Programming (POP). POP calls on users to gather ethnographic data about themselves using Cultural Probes and on end-user innovation via software toolkits. This turn Of focus is timely as the analyst/designer of interactive systems is facing new challenges regarding flexibility, user situatedness, dynamic environments, incomplete data, diversity in user needs, sensors in the environment, and users emersed in multiple parallel social worlds. Based on an extensive background analysis this paper distills a set of key aspects that any POP effort should possess.",,第4页.xls
102,The Emergence of Adversarial Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning [arXiv],2020,"Many real-world problems require the coordination of multiple autonomous agents. Recent work has shown the promise of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn explicit communication strategies that enable complex multi-agent coordination. These works use models of cooperative multi-agent systems whereby agents strive to achieve a shared global goal. When considering agents with self-interested local objectives, the standard design choice is to model these as separate learning systems (albeit sharing the same environment). Such a design choice, however, precludes the existence of a single, differentiable communication channel, and consequently prohibits the learning of inter-agent communication strategies. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a learning model that accommodates individual non-shared rewards and a differentiable communication channel that is common among all agents. We focus on the case where agents have self-interested objectives, and develop a learning algorithm that elicits the emergence of adversarial communications. We perform experiments on multi-agent coverage and path planning problems, and employ a post-hoc interpretability technique to visualize the messages that agents communicate to each other. We show how a single self-interested agent is capable of learning highly manipulative communication strategies that allows it to significantly outperform a cooperative team of agents.",,第4页.xls
103,Cooperative Human-Robot Grasping With Extended Contact Patches,2020,"Grasping large and heavy objects with a robot assistant is one of the most interesting scenarios in physical Human-Robot Interaction. Many solutions have been proposed in the last 40 years, focusing not only on human safety, but also on comfort and ergonomics. When carrying objects with large planar surfaces, classical contact models developed in robotic grasping cannot be used. This is why we conceived a contact model explicitly considering contact area properties and thus suitable to deal with grasps requiring large contact patches from the robot side. Together with the model, this work proposes a decentralized control strategy to implement cooperative object handling between humans and robots. Experimental results showed that the proposed method performs better than a simpler one, which does not account for contact patch properties. The control strategy is decentralized and needs minimal exteroceptive sensing (force/torque sensor at the robot wrist), so the proposed approach can easily be generalized to human-robot teams composed of more than two agents.",,第4页.xls
104,CAROSSE: an agent-oriented CAD tool for designing complex electronic systems,2000,"In this article we present an original approach as an aid to the design of complex systems in an industrial context. While the dominant approach in DAI consists in tackling the design from the angle of teams of human designers (multi-expert systems, cognitive MAS), we describe the system to be designed by the simile of interacting artificial ecosystems, each one inhabited by heterogeneous agents whose objective is to work collectively towards the aims set by one of the designers. We argue that this approach allows us to obtain the qualities of modularity, reusability and extensibility, while at the same time allowing the different points of view and levels of abstraction used in the design process to be represented. The example, which illustrates our approach, is the CAROSSE project, fruit of the cooperation between the LIP6, the LORIA and the car constructor PSA, whose aim is to integrate intelligent assistance tools into the present automobile design processes.",,第4页.xls
105,Stable Emergent Agent Distributions under Sensing and Travel Delays,2008,"In order for a team of cooperating agents to achieve a group goal (such as searching for targets, monitoring an environment, etc.) those agents must be able to share information and achieve some level of coordination. Since realistic methods of communication between agents have limited range and speed, the agents' decision-making strategies must operate with incomplete and outdated information. Moreover, in many situations the agents must travel to particular locations in order to perform various tasks, and so there will also be a delay between any particular decision and its effect. In this paper we develop an asynchronous framework that models the behavior of a group of agents that is spatially distributed across a predefined area of interest. We derive general conditions under which the group is guaranteed to converge to a specific distribution within the environment without any form of central control and despite unknown but bounded delays in sensing and travel. The achieved distribution is optimal in the sense that the proportion of agents allocated over each area matches the relative importance of that area. Finally, based on the derived conditions, we design a cooperative control scheme for a multi-agent surveillance problem. Via Monte Carlo simulations we show how sensing and travel delays and the degree of cooperation between agents affect the rate at which they achieve the desired coverage of the region under surveillance.",,第4页.xls
106,"The Amazon Initiative: A multidisciplinary, international consortium for prevention, mitigation and reduction of resource degradation",2005,"An institutional consortium has been formed in the Amazon to implement collaborative programs to reverse resource degradation through sustainable land use systems. The Amazon Initiative (AI) Consortium for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Natural Resources was created in mid-2003 and formalized in 2004 by the National Agricultural Research Institutions of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, together with four centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research: CIAT, CIFOR, ICRAF, and IPGRI. Associate institutions include regional research centers and universities. Consortium partners are creating an inter-institutional and interdisciplinary team, which will function as a distributed network of scientists, working at different sites in the Amazon. Under this arrangement, the Amazon Initiative will create conditions for institutional articulation and strengthen analytical skills to identify priorities for research and development intervention. In addition, the AI will develop methodological tools and information communication mechanisms to enhance the role of local agents for the sustainable development of their regions. In doing so, the AI will contribute to enhancing living conditions of traditional populations and smallholders in the region, while effectively contributing to integrated natural resource management and conservation efforts in sites highly exposed to development pressures in six Amazonian countries.",,第4页.xls
107,A FORMAL LANGUAGE THEORETIC APPROACH TO DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ON DYNAMIC NETWORKS,2010,"In this paper, we present a formal language theoretic approach to the behavior of complex systems of cooperating and communicating agents performing distributed computation on dynamic networks. In particular, we model peer-to-peer networks and the information harvest of Internet crawlers on the World Wide Web, employing grammar systems theoretical constructions. In grammar systems theory, the grammars can be interpreted as agents, whilst the generated language describes the behavior of the system. To characterize the various phenomena that may arise in peer-to-peer networks, we apply networks of parallel multiset string processors. The multiset string processors form teams, send and receive information through collective and individual filters. We deal with the dynamics of the string collections. To describe the information harvest of the crawlers, we employ certain regulated rewriting devices in eco-grammar systems. We illustrate the wide range of applicability of the regulated rewriting devices in the field of web crawling techniques. We demonstrate that these eco-grammar systems with rather simple component grammars suffice to identify any recursively enumerable language.",,第4页.xls
108,Towards Adaptive Networks - Generalized utility functions in Multi-Agent Frameworks,2024,"Autonomous management of multiple services is a crucial requirement of 6G networks. In recent years, researchers have been working on using artificial intelligence(AI) to orchestrate intents, autonomously, through Intent Management Functions (IMFs). These IMFs can handle conflicting service intents and prioritize the global objective based on predefined utility function and intent priorities. However, for such frameworks to be successful in real-life scenarios, they must be flexible to business situations. Service priorities can change, and the utility function that measures the fulfillment of objectives may also vary in definition. This paper proposes a novel method that enables the IMF to adapt to unseen forms of utility functions and changes in service priorities at run-time without requiring additional training. We assume the IMF contains agents trained using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to perform actions and multiple such MARL systems are orchestrated by Ad-hoc teaming approaches. Results on a network emulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods that require additional training to achieve the same flexibility, thereby saving costs and increasing adaptability.",,第4页.xls

This ongoing research is being performed by the Research Group in Individual Oriented Modeling at the University Autonoma of Barcelona with close collaboration of the hospital staff team. The objective of the proposed ABM procedure is to optimize the performance of such complex and dynamic healthcare EDs. Exhaustive search optimization is used to find the optimal ED staff configuration, which includes doctors, triage nurses, and admission personnel, i.e., a multi-dimensional problem. An index is proposed to minimize patient length of stay in the ED. The results obtained by using alternatives Monte Carlo and Pipeline schemes are promising and a better understanding of the problem is achieved. The impact of such schemes to reduce the computational cost of exhaustive search is outlined.",,第4页.xls
110,Battlespace situation awareness for Force XXI,1997,"Timely battlefield digitization and battlespace visualization is a requirement to keep pace with ever-diminishing military decision cycle times driven by evolving weapons systems and pacing military doctrine for Force XXI. One ingredient to battlefield situation awareness is imagery intelligence. This paper proposes a novel architecture for an imagery analysis environment to seamlessly provide imagery intelligence. A critical component of this proposed architecture is emerging intelligent software agent technology levering human-computer interface (HCI) technology. This combination enables a modular, scaleable, and reconfigurable battlefield situation awareness and exploitation environment. The consequent impact of this paper is the definition of an entirely new method to support military intelligence, planning and execution processes. The proposed architecture effectively provides real-time/near real-time sensor fusion, sensor management, and battle management in a single collaborative environment. This paper provides the design and describes the technologies necessary to make this system a reality.",,第4页.xls
111,A distributed adverse drug reaction detection system using intelligent agents with a fuzzy recognition-primed decision model,2007,"Discovering unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance as early as possible is highly desirable. Nevertheless, current postmarketing surveillance methods largely rely on spontaneous reports that suffer from serious underreporting, latency, and inconsistent reporting. Thus these methods are not ideal for rapidly identifying rare ADRs. The multiagent systems paradigm is an emerging and effective approach to tackling distributed problems, especially when data sources and knowledge are geographically located in different places and coordination and collaboration are necessary for decision making. In this article, we propose an active, multiagent framework for early detection of ADRs by utilizing electronic patient data distributed across many different sources and locations. In this framework, intelligent agents assist a team of experts based on the well-known human decision-making model called Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD). We generalize the RPD model to a fuzzy RPD model and utilize fuzzy logic technology to not only represent, interpret, and compute imprecise and subjective cues that are commonly encountered in the ADR problem but also to retrieve prior experiences by evaluating the extent of matching between the current situation and a past experience. We describe our preliminary multiagent system design and illustrate its potential benefits for assisting expert teams in early detection of previously unknown ADRs.

112,Toward a Cross-Cultural and Cross-Language Multi-Agent Recommendation Model for Food and Nutrition,2012,"In this paper, we present our efforts to develop a multi-agent-based framework for cross-cultural and cross-language personalized health and nutrition semantic search. Many agents that share either the same culture or same language or same health profile could share valuable information found through their semantic search. Their interests in a common viewpoint have some similarities which could be used to shorten the learning curve and give good search results effectively. Each agent is representing a user with a specific culture, language and personal health profile. What an agent likes as culture is likely similar to a different agent with the same culture. The same thing applies with language and health profiles. For example, an agent with a diabetes profile could help another agent that has a similar health profile with its valuable findings. We introduce how multi-agents could team up to contribute to each other, learn from each other, and share valuable information with each other using collaborative profile ontology. We propose a cross-cultural, cross-language, health-and nutrition-based ontology profile that could be used as the basis for collaboration between different agents.",,第4页.xls
113,A Decentralized Cooperative Control Scheme With Obstacle Avoidance for a Team of Mobile Robots,2014,"The problem of formation control of a team of mobile robots based on the virtual and behavioral structures is considered in this paper. In the virtual structure, each mobile robot is modeled by an electric charge. The mobile robots move toward a circle, and due to repulsive forces between the identical charges, regular polygon formations of the mobile robots will be realized. For swarm formation, a virtual mobile robot is located at the center of the circle, and other mobile robots follow it. In the introduced approach, each mobile robot finds its position in the formation autonomously, and the formation can change automatically in the case of change in the number of the mobile robots. This paper also proposes a technique for avoiding obstacles based on the behavioral structure. In this technique, when a mobile robot gets close to an obstacle, while moving toward its target, a rotational potential field is applied to lead the mobile robot to avoid the obstacle, without locating in local minimum positions.",,第4页.xls

115,Intruder capture in sierpinski graphs,2007,"In this paper we consider the problem of capturing an intruder in a networked environment. The intruder is defined as a mobile entity that moves arbitrarily fast inside the network and escapes from a team of software agents. The agents have to collaborate and coordinate their moves in order to isolate the intruder. They move asynchronously and they know the network topology they are in is a particular fractal graph, the Sierpinski graph SG(n).We first derive lower bounds on the minimum number of agents, number of moves and time steps required to capture the intruder. We then consider two models: one in which agents have a capability, of seeing the state of their neighbors; the second one in which the actions of the agents are leaded by a coordinator. One of our goals is to continue a previous study on what is the impact of visibility on complexity: we have found that in this topology the visibility assumption allows us to reach an optimal bound on the number of agents required for the cleaning strategy. On the other hand, the second strategy relies only on local computations but requires an extra agent and a higher (by a constant) complexity in terms of time and number of moves.",,第4页.xls

Application examples are also given to illustrate the information feedback strategies.",,第4页.xls
117,Work in progress - towards a tool to analyze qualitative aspects of the relations among members of social networks,2009,"This paper discusses a tool to study the relations among group members of a social network that evolve using a virtual environment. Understanding how these relations are built and maintained is essential to foster favorable conditions that can facilitate collective and individual learning. The focus of interest is how inner relations affect both the collective and individual learning of its members. We consider a group as being a set of relations among people and artifacts. As an example, we might determine which relations among members of a Project Team (predominantly goal-oriented) are different from the ones found in Communities of Practice (predominantly learning-oriented), and how they affect the learning of their members. We propose to characterize the relations among members by analyzing text content of social exchanges (e.g. email messages, blog posts, chat sessions, etc). The approach originality relies on taking into account the distinct points of view of its actors. Due to the distributed character of the problem (a virtual group), we intend to develop this tool by using a Multi- Agent System, whose architecture we present in this paper.",,第4页.xls
118,"Distributed information retrieval and dissemination in swarm-based networks of mobile, autonomous agents",2003,"In this paper, we present an optimal design for local explicit communication and collaboration in a swarm-based, mobile, robotic system. We propose a methodology for finding the design parameter, i.e., the communication range, for a fast, distributed information exchange and dissemination among the teammates, and a reliable and efficient information retrieval by the base station(s). Our approach consists of maximizing the interaction/collaboration rate, and hence the rate of information exchange between the mobile agents in the presence of destructive interferences. The proposed approach takes into account the spatial distribution of the agents, which is a function of the agents' movement pattern in the environment. We illustrate the usefulness and efficiency of local interaction between the teammates and its effect on information retrieval, first by presenting a collaborative, sensing task consisting of using a team of autonomous agents with limited sensing capabilities to count some objects scattered throughout an enclosed region. Then we introduce a general mathematical methodology for maximizing the collaboration rate, and hence the rate of information spread in similar networks of multiple, cooperating mobile agents. We validate our results with a sensor-based simulator of real, mobile robots.",,第4页.xls
119,Decision Support for Choosing an Appropriate Simulation Method for Dynamic Material Flow Analysis,2015,"When improving industrial process chains in terms of productivity it is becoming more and more important to not only consider the static, but also the dynamic behavior of value streams. The effects of intended changes on production systems often are unknown and could underlie vast variations due to the planned outcome. In order to validate such changes before implementation, the use of material flow simulation is widely discussed in research and industrial practice. Such optimization projects usually require the collaboration of production system and simulation experts. Through the increased dissemination of various simulation tools on the market as well as multiple simulation methods available (discrete event, agent based and system dynamics) the actual selection of a suitable simulation setting is a challenging task. To support such optimization teams in the selection of an appropriate simulation method a decision making approach based on comparative criteria is shown and discussed in this article, concluding with a case study.",,第4页.xls
120,Modeling interaction strategies using POS: An application to soccer robots,2006,"As seen earlier POS is a general agent conversation protocol engineering formalism that has proved efficient when used in communities of software information agents. The aim of this paper is to show how much POS is simple, easy to use, and very appropriate for implementing interaction protocols in a collaborative agent setting. In order to exemplify our approach we focus on an application domain with real time constraints such as soccer robots and show how an inherently symbolic abstract system like POS can be neatly integrated with agents whose internal architecture is reactive and relies on bottom-up behavior-based techniques.First, we shortly discuss aspects of heterogeneity with respect to soccer robots and present the RoboCup experimental setting. Then we sketch the difficulties that arise when trying to coordinate an heterogeneous team with conventional methods. In response, we introduce some elements of the POS (Protocol Operational Semantics) model. The following sections examine several basic behaviors of the JavaSoccer simulation environment as it is later used along with TeamBots to highlight POS' capabilities, demonstrate how POS is a suited theoretical tool and leads to extremely compact and modular code due to its high expressive power, and discuss the obtained results. Finally we conclude the article with a comparison to related works as well as some perspectives about the engineering of interaction protocols.",,第4页.xls

We present the development of an efficient and robust distributed collaborative search algorithm for a team of unmanned robots that must locate the emitter of a toxic plume in an urban setting. We aim to provide a scientific, yet practical, approach to the design and analysis of rapidly deployable, scalable, adaptive, cost-effective groups of autonomous robots to replace or complement humans in the hazardous task of localizing the source of toxic chemical, biological or radiological plumes.

122,"Categorical Soft Data Fusion via Variational Bayesian Importance Sampling, with Applications to Cooperative Search",2011,"This paper considers Bayesian data fusion with categorical 'soft sensor' information, such as human input in cooperative multi-agent search applications. Previous work studied variational Bayesian (VB) hybrid data fusion, which produces optimistic posterior covariance estimates and requires simple Gaussian priors with softmax likelihoods. Here, a new hybrid fusion procedure, known as variational Bayesian importance sampling (VBIS), is introduced to combine the strengths of VB and fast Monte Carlo methods to produce more reliable Gaussian posterior approximations for Gaussian priors and softmax likelihoods. VBIS is then generalized to problems involving complex Gaussian mixture priors and multimodal softmax observation models to obtain reliable Gaussian mixture posterior approximations. The utility and accuracy of the VBIS fusion method is demonstrated on a multitarget search problem for a real cooperative human-automaton team.",,第4页.xls
123,"Been there, done that: a personalised mobile agent system for the next generation of call centres",2001,"The call centre industry is currently facing a dichotomy. The growth of call centres is exploding worldwide, with an estimated 5% of all people in the UK expected to be employed in one by year 2005. At the moment, the call centre is still central to the customer contact strategies of most organisations, but the rules are being rewritten with the emergence of the so-called `dot-com' companies who regard the electronic channel as their principal interface with the customer. If that was not problematic enough, customers' expectations are growing, demanding more choice, flexibility, easy navigation and greater intimacy. In this paper, we present the Virtual Inhabited Call Centre (VICC), a novel Web-based call centre that leverages the power of a mobile multi-agent architecture. VICC is not so much an attempt to develop a technology, but about the potential of using a set of new technologies for the benefit of everyone.",,第4页.xls

125,A multi-agent system for supporting the prediction of protein structures,2004,"In the last years numerous tools for predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins have been proposed. Although their performance is constantly increasing, they are not sufficiently general to be exploited in any prediction problem. As a consequence, in order to improve the prediction quality, it could be particularly useful to jointly apply different prediction tools to the same problem and, then, integrate their results. In such a context, since the various predictors could have different performances on the same prediction, the choice of the predictors to jointly apply for guaranteeing the best performances appears crucial. In this paper we propose X-MACoP, an XML multi-agent system for supporting a user in the prediction of the three-dimensional structures of proteins. In particular, X-MACoP carries out the following tasks, in a way completely transparent for the user: (i) choice of the most promising predictor team to apply for the prediction problem of interest for the user; (ii) integration of the results produced by the predictors of the team for constructing a unique global prediction for the user; (iii) possible translation of predictor inputs and outputs in such a way that a user handles a unique data format.",,第4页.xls
126,Cooperative Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems: A Survey,2019,"The emergence of the Internet of things and the widespread deployment of diverse computing systems have led to the formation of heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) to complete a variety of tasks. Motivated to highlight the state of the art on existing MAS while identifying their limitations, remaining challenges, and possible future directions, we survey recent contributions to the field. We focus on robot agents and emphasize the challenges of MAS sub-fields including task decomposition, coalition formation, task allocation, perception, and multi-agent planning and control. While some components have seen more advancements than others, more research is required before effective autonomous MAS can be deployed in real smart city settings that are less restrictive than the assumed validation environments of MAS. Specifically, more autonomous end-to-end solutions need to be experimentally tested and developed while incorporating natural language ontology and dictionaries to automate complex task decomposition and leveraging big data advancements to improve perception algorithms for robotics.",,第4页.xls

The paper discusses research on co-operative robots, the design of their control architectures and proposes future developments and improvements by presenting design methods, evaluation of the control systems, and applications such as robot football. Different forms of co-operation are presented. In particular, the paper shows how multiple mobile robot systems architectures may be designed by examining six key issues. (1) centralised, decentralised or hybrid control, (2) heterogeneous or homogeneous robots, (3) co-operation with or without communication, (implicit or explicit communication), (4) making agents that work as a team, (5) multiple mobile robots path planning, and (6) learning. The paper also reviews and gives brief descriptions of the most common architectures for co-operative robots, emphasising the theory and the implementation of these techniques.

129,Trust in multi-agent systems,2006,"Research in Multi-Agent Systems has revealed that Agents must enter into a relationship voluntarily in order to collaborate, otherwise that collaborative efforts may fail [1,2]. When examining this problem, trust becomes the focus in promoting the ability to collaborate, however trust itself is defined from several perspectives. Trust between agents within Multi-Agent System may be analogous to the trust that is required between humans. A Trust, Negotiation, Communication model currently being developed, is based around trust and may be used as a basis for future research and the ongoing development of Multi-Agent System (MAS).This paper is focused on discussing how the architecture of an agent could be designed to provide it the ability to foster trust between agents and therefore to dynamically organise within a team environment or across distributed systems to enhance individual abilities. The Trust, Negotiation, Communication (TNC) model is a proposed building block that provides an agent with the mechanisms to develop a formal trust network both through cooperation(1) or confederated or collaborative associations(2). The model is conceptual, therefore discussion is limited to the basic framework.",,第4页.xls

Due to the situation of CAS operations being more and more complicated, the mission of CAS is becoming harder to operate than in past operations. Adjusting the role of teammate in a strike team is crucial in close air support (CAS). In this paper, we depict the role types of the Joint CAS team and the models of the role mental states such as the role belief, role goal and role plan firstly; and then we propose the role adjusting strategy based on the CAS situation and mission, i.e., the situation-oriented and the mission-oriented role adjusting strategies, such as role belief, role goal, and role plan adjusting strategies etc., so that the role of the teammate can be adjusted to meet the requirement of the joint CAS and the combat effectiveness can be increased in maximum degrees.",,第4页.xls

132,A dynamic input-output work capacity model for a group of agents,2012,"Work capacity models are very important tool in profiling a person against a defined set of competencies usually related to knowledge and skills, and the person's physical and behavioral characteristics and constraints. In the case of an engineering student, for example, these set of competencies may be defined by a mentor or adviser such as, but are not limited to: knowledge on certain theoretical and practical aspects, skills in analyzing and designing engineering systems, leadership skills, and team-work, for example. Physical and behavioral characteristics, on the other hand, would depend on the person being assessed and various methods are also available in literature. However, work capacity models available in literature suffer from various drawbacks such as: 1) they do not reflect the fact that work capacity vary with time and external conditions; and 2) work capacity models are usually used to describe a single agent and not on a group of agents. In order to be able to include these drawbacks and convert them as added features, a dynamic input-output model describing the work capacity of a group of agents is devised using simple linear algebra and system theory concepts. We show that such models could be utilized in the academe in assessing the net work capacity (NWC) of a group of student working on a thesis topic, or even in the industry in assessing the NWC of a certain group of employees in a department, for example.",,第4页.xls
133,The effect of trust and its antecedents towards determining users' behavioral intention with voice-based consumer electronic devices,2022,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have ushered in a new era of consumer electronic (CE) devices: the voice-based CE devices (VCED's). A striking feature that separates these from other CE devices are their anthropomorphic capabilities. While current CE research has given a strong focus on improving various technical and security aspects of the VCED's, not much efforts have been given to explore their diffusion and acceptance in the society. However, if the CE community is to progress then there is an urgent need to view these systems from a sociotechnical perspective and take the user perceptions into account for further product development. In this work we propose a novel research framework by incorporating Human Computer Interaction (HCI) theories and Para Social Relationship Theory for exploring the effect of trust on the behavioral intention of users towards VCED's, keeping in mind their human-like attributes. Data is analyzed using a Structural Equation Modelling approach from 675 users of VCED devices from two Asian countries. Results show that the functional aspects of performance and effort expectancy, and social aspects of presence and cognition affect the trust factor. Privacy concerns do not affect trust. Overall, the results suggest that users treat VCED's as social objects employing social rules while interaction that indicates a dual nature of anthropomorphic systems.

Multi-robot area coverage is encountered in many applications of multi-robot systems including unmanned search and rescue, aerial reconnaissance, robotic demining, automatic lawn mowing, and inspection of engineering structures. We envisage that multi-robot coverage can be performed efficiently if robots are coordinated to form small teams while covering the environment. In this paper, we use a technique from coalitional game theory called a weighted voting game that allows each robot to dynamically identify other team members and form teams so that the efficiency of the area coverage operation is improved. We propose and evaluate a novel technique of computing the weights of a weighted voting game based on each robot's coverage capability and finding the best minimal winning coalition(BMWC). Also we designed a greedy method and a heuristic method to find BMWC in O(n log n) time and O(n(2)) time respectively. We tested these two algorithm with our base line method.",,第4页.xls

The RoboCube is conceptualized to implement players with as many on-board features as possible in an extremely flexible way. For this purpose, the RoboCube provides significant computation power and memory as well as a multitude of I/O interfaces within the space constraints.

136,Robust multi-robot cooperation through dynamic task allocation and precaution routines,2006,"In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a multi-robot cooperation framework to collectively execute inter-dependent tasks of an overall complex mission requiring diverse capabilities. Given a heterogeneous team of robots and task dependencies, the proposed framework provides a distributed mechanism for assigning tasks to robots in an order that efficiently completes the mission. The approach is robust to unreliable communication and robot failures. It is a distributed auction-based approach, and therefore scalable. In order to obtain optimal allocations, effective bid evaluations are needed. Additionally to maintain optimality in noisy environments, dynamic re-allocations of tasks are needed as implemented in dynamic task selection and coalition maintenance scheme that we propose. Real-time contingencies are handled by recovery routines, called Plan B precautions in our framework. Here, in this paper, we present performance results of our framework for robustness in simulations that include variable message loss rates and robot failures. Experiments illustrate robustness of our approach against several contingencies.",,第4页.xls
137,Human-robot cooperation using multi-agent-systems,2001,"In this paper a new intelligent robot control scheme is presented which enables a cooperative work of humans and robots through direct contact interaction in a partially known environment. Because of the high flexibility and adaptability, the human-robot cooperation is expected to have a wide range of applications in uncertain environments, not only in future construction and manufacturing industries but also in service branches. A multi-agent control architecture gives an appropriate frame for the flexibility of the human-robot-team. Robots are considered as intelligent autonomous assistants of humans which can mutually interact on a symbolic level and a physical level. This interaction is achieved through the exchange of information between humans and robots, the interpretation of the transmitted information, the coordination of the activities and the cooperation between independent system components. Equipped with sensing modalities for the perception of the environment, the robot system KAMRO (Karlsruhe Autonomous Mobile Robot) is introduced to demonstrate the principles of the cooperation among humans and robot agents. Experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of our concept.",,第4页.xls

Rather than directly marking their environment, the robots announce their successful paths through a common localization space. It is found that the algorithm is robust to significant localization error, suggesting that the method will be viable for teams of real robots.",,第4页.xls
139,Working as a team: using social criteria in the timed patrolling problem,2012,"The multi-agent patrolling task constitutes a challenging issue for Artificial Intelligence and has the potential to cover a variety of domains ranging from agent-based simulations to crises management. Several techniques have been proposed in the last few years to address the multi-agent patrolling task with a closed-system setting. A few centralized strategies were also described to address the open-system setting, in which the agents can enter or leave the patrolling task at will.In this article, we propose two decentralized, cooperative, auction-based strategies in which agents trade the nodes they have to visit. These strategies are inspired from the computational social choice theory and allow the agents to reason on the performances of the group rather than on their own. We show that these strategies perform at least as well as the state-of-the-art centralized performances, and better on specific criteria.",,第4页.xls
140,On Evolving Multi-agent FX Traders,2014,"Current frameworks for identifying trading agents using machine learning are able to simultaneously address the characterization of both technical indicator and decision tree. Moreover, multi-agent frameworks have also been proposed with the goal of improving the reliability and trust in the agent policy identified. Such advances need weighing against the computational overhead of assuming such flexibility. In this work a framework for evolutionary multi-agent trading is introduced and systematically benchmarked for FX currency trading; including the impact of FX trading spread. It is demonstrated that simplifications can be made to the 'base' trading agent that do not impact on the quality of solutions, but provide considerable computational speedups. The resulting evolutionary multi-agent architecture is demonstrated to provide significant benefits to the profitability and improve the reliability with which profitable policies are returned.",,第4页.xls
141,Dynamic Models of Appraisal Networks Explaining Collective Learning,2016,"This paper proposes models of learning process in groups of individuals who collectively execute a sequence of tasks and whose actions are determined by individual skill levels and networks of interpersonal appraisals and influence. The closely-related proposed models have increasing complexity, starting with a centralized manager-based assignment and learning model, and finishing with a social model of interpersonal appraisal, assignments, learning, and influences. We show how rational optimal behavior arises along the task sequence for each model. Our models are grounded in replicator dynamics from evolutionary games, influence networks from mathematical sociology, and transactive memory systems from organization science.",,第4页.xls
142,Massive Multi-agent Data-Driven Simulations of the GitHub Ecosystem,2019,"Simulating and predicting planetary-scale techno-social systems poses heavy computational and modeling challenges. The DARPA SocialSim program set the challenge to model the evolution of GitHub, a large collaborative software-development ecosystem, using massive multi-agent simulations. We describe our best performing models and our agent-based simulation framework, which we are currently extending to allow simulating other planetary-scale techno-social systems. The challenge problem measured participants ability, given 30 months of meta-data on user activity on GitHub, to predict the next months activity as measured by a broad range of metrics applied to ground truth, using agent-based simulation. The challenge required scaling to a simulation of roughly 3 million agents producing a combined 30 million actions, acting on 6 million repositories with commodity hardware. It was also important to use the data optimally to predict the agents next moves. We describe the agent framework and the data analysis employed by one of the winning teams in the challenge. Six different agent models were tested based on a variety of machine learning and statistical methods. While no single method proved the most accurate on every metric, the broadly most successful sampled from a stationary probability distribution of actions and repositories for each agent. Two reasons for the success of these agents were their use of a distinct characterization of each agent, and that GitHub users change their behavior relatively slowly.",,第4页.xls
143,Collaborative Space Surveillance,2009,"This paper presents a space-based, space-surveillance study wherein the goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the modeling and simulation of a distributed multi-agent multiple satellites tracking and prediction system. A flexible and modular system architecture that enables collaborative and efficient teaming among distributed agents is delineated. Hierarchical objective methodology is deployed to align the mission objectives with the diverse agents' capabilities and resources. A set of satellite platform and sensor configuration/models is considered. Detailed mathematical models of the satellite orbits including the mutual visibility function are simulated for combinations of GEO and LEO orbits. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)/Distributed Unscented Information Filter (DUIF) for high-accuracy orbital determination and tracking is demonstrated to show that the LEO orbit estimation from the GEO satellite with only angle measurements based on UKF is an excellent approach. Simulation studies show that the rate of filter convergence depends on sample time period, initial error, process error, measurement errors as well as the relative geometry of the LEO and GEO satellite orbits.",,第4页.xls

145,A psychological process model of the solution of mechanics problems by elementary school students: An interdisciplinary project,1998,"The purpose of this study is to propose a process model to explain elementary school students' solutions of three simple problems in elementary mechanics. Forty eight 5(th) grade students were given three drawings depicting objects of various sizes in different kinetic states or being pushed by a human agent. They were asked to say whether a force was being exerted on the objects and to explain why. A process model has been proposed to explain students' answers to the three questions. The innovation of the process model is that it attempts to link two levels of representation: A semantic level, where a concept is analysed in terms of the presuppositions, beliefs, and mental models that underlie it and a syntactic level that specifies how concepts are related to other concepts in hierarchical categories. The work has been validated by a computer model designed by the AI team (Vosniadou, Kayser, Champesme, Ioannides & Dimitrakopoulou, in press).",,第4页.xls
146,Deterministic Network Exploration by Anonymous Silent Agents with Local Traffic Reports,2014,"A team consisting of an unknown number of mobile agents starting from different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different times, have to explore the network: Every node must be visited by at least one agent, and all agents must eventually stop. Agents are anonymous (identical), execute the same deterministic algorithm, and move in synchronous rounds along links of the network. They are silent: They cannot send any messages to other agents or mark visited nodes in any way. In the absence of any additional information, exploration with termination of an arbitrary network in this model, devoid of any means of communication between agents, is impossible. Our aim is to solve the exploration problem by giving to agents very restricted local traffic reports. Specifically, an agent that is at a node nu in a given round is provided with three bits of information answering the following questions: Am I alone at nu? Did any agent enter nu in this round? Did any agent exit v in this round? We show that this small amount of information permits us to solve the exploration problem in arbitrary networks. More precisely, we give a deterministic terminating exploration algorithm working in arbitrary networks for all initial configurations that are not perfectly symmetric; that is, in which there are agents with different views of the network. The algorithm works in polynomial time in the (unknown) size of the network. A deterministic terminating exploration algorithm working for all initial configurations in arbitrary networks does not exist.",,第4页.xls
147,Towards better information transparency in the air traffic landing system: A novel agent-based model with implicit interactions,2019,"With the ever-increasing demands of air traffic flow management, its landing system requires fundamental improvements to meet the future needs. For the current landing system, information gaps between parties (i.e. pilots and air traffic controllers) cause interaction conflicts, which hinder a system's risks detection and mitigation. Therefore, a well-implementation of data-links can promise a better information transparency, by facilitating the development of team cognition and the execution of implicit interaction between parties to predictively adapt to changing conditions. To achieve it, this research proposes a smart interaction system based on the two agent-based models (ABMs), and further compared them to examine the improvements of a system's reliability and efficiency. Results show that implicit interaction significantly reduces the reactive actions needed to cope with congestions and system errors. Moreover, the efficiency of resource utilization is also improved without causing significant delay, and hence characterizes a more reliable and efficient landing system.",,第4页.xls
148,Using hierarchical dynamical systems to control reactive behavior,2000,"This paper describes the mechanical and electrical design, as well as the control strategy, of the FU-Fighters robots, a F180 league team that won the second place at RoboCup'99. It explains how we solved the computer vision and radio communication problems that arose in the course of the project.The paper mainly discusses the hierarchical control architecture used to generate the behavior of individual agents and the team. Our reactive approach is based on the Dual Dynamics framework developed by H. Jager, in which activation dynamics determines when a behavior is allowed to influence the actuators, and a target dynamics establishes how this is done. We extended the original framework by adding a third module, the perceptual dynamics. Here, the readings of fast changing sensors are aggregated temporarily to form complex, slow changing percepts. We describe the bottom-up design of behaviors and illustrate our approach using examples from the RoboCup domain.",,第4页.xls

150,Self-emergence of a common lexicon by evolution in teams of autonomous agents,2012,"In multi-agent systems, the study of language and communication is an active field of research. In this paper we present the application of evolutionary strategies to the self-emergence of a common lexicon in a population of agents. By modeling the vocabulary or lexicon of each agent as an association matrix or look-up table that maps the meanings (i.e. the objects encountered by the agents or the states of the environment itself) into symbols or signals we check whether it is possible for the population to converge in an autonomous, decentralized way to a common lexicon, so that the communication efficiency of the entire population is optimal. We have conducted several experiments aimed at testing whether it is possible to converge with evolutionary strategies to an optimal Saussurean communication system. We have organized our experiments alongside two main lines: first, we have investigated the effect of the population size on the convergence results. Second, and foremost, we have also investigated the effect of the lexicon size on the convergence results. To analyze the convergence of the population of agents we have defined the population's consensus when all the agents (i.e. 100% of the population) share the same association matrix or lexicon. As a general conclusion we have shown that evolutionary strategies are powerful enough optimizers to guarantee the convergence to lexicon consensus in a population of autonomous agents.

151,Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risk of Language Models,2024,"Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have the potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and other researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute bash commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks, which break down a task into intermediary steps for more gradated evaluation; we add subtasks for 17 of the 40 tasks. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 7 models: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. Without guidance, we find that agents are able to solve only the easiest complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o having the highest success rates. Finally, subtasks provide more signal for measuring performance compared to unguided runs, with models achieving a 3.2\% higher success rate on complete tasks with subtask-guidance than without subtask-guidance.

153,"Distributed contract networks of sensor agents with adaptive reconfiguration: modelling, simulation, implementation and experiments",2001,"As both sensors and communication technologies are becoming more powerful at decreasing costs, sensor networks are constantly growing in complexity, i.e. in the information they generate and in the need for coordinating network resources. In this paper we comparatively explore the performance of multi-level hierarchical networks and flat networks, i.e, arrays of sensor agents with specific competences but without predefined communication or control structures. We develop a model of the performance of these types of networks for analysing the throughput of sensing tasks depending on a variety of network and sensor parameters. This analytical model serves as the basis for numerical simulation runs, which reveal the specific advantages of the different network structures. Motivated by these results, we develop an adaptive control scheme, which enables the network to organise itself at runtime so as to achieve the highest result precision in minimum time with minimum communication overhead, maximum parallelism and maximum fault tolerance. This control scheme is a computer-operational version of the contract network, originally proposed for problem solving in distributed artificial intelligence, with agents teaming up dynamically after a negotiation phase following a task specification. The metaphor of contracting also holds the potential to integrate agents that control actuators, e.g. cooperating robots, by assigning appropriate competences to them. Hence the design of sensorimotor systems, whose behaviour is adaptively controlled in a situation-dependent way by a team of different sensors, is a straightforward extension. Moreover, it is also easy to extend the network by adding agents that do not have a sensing component and can only perform sensor data processing tasks. We introduce a complete software framework for implementing these kinds of networks. It consists of a formal specification of the requirements that the sensory component of an agent has to meet and a comprehensive library of C ++ objects encapsulating all of the negotiation protocol and communications routines. In the experimental section of the paper we show how several uncalibrated cameras are used to estimate the trajectory of a manipulator in order to guide the manipulator towards a target in real time. We also illustrate how agent-teams may easily reconfigure during task execution in the case of unexpected events. We then go on to show how complex vision tasks can be broken down into tasks that identical agents may work on in parallel. Finally we show how fusion for vision at a symbolic, i.e. object description level, may contribute to solve the hard problem of recognising occluded objects from different view points. We conclude the paper by summarising our results and sketching future research, in particular the automatic mutual reprogramming of agents using a specifically developed ontology.

154,How to model a likely behavior of a pedagogical agent from a real situation,2015,"The aim of this work is to model the behavior verbal and nonverbal behavior of a Pedagogical Agent (PA) can be integrated into an Intelligent Tutoring System. The following research questions were posed: what is the nonverbal component of an educational communication? How to study this component for a computational model of plausible behavior of a virtual agent? What correlations between educational actions and the direction of gaze of a human agent? To carry out exploratory work, a methodological approach based on multi-modal video corpus study was adopted. Within a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists and didactics of mathematics, an educational situation in which a virtual pedagogical agent is likely was developed. Dyadic interactions between teachers and learners late second early third (15-16 years) in a skills assessment interview in mathematics following the resolution of exercises by students with a mathematics software was filmed. A multi-level annotation scheme to annotate the observed behavior was proposed. The multidisciplinary research subject (ITS, Human-Machine Interfaces, Educational sciences, educational, linguistic etc.) due to the development of the coding scheme a delicate but important work given the wealth of knowledge from different disciplines. After a portion of the collected work annotation corpus statistical measures derived from annotations carried out suggest different strategies for teachers in terms of gaze direction depending on the learner profile and pedagogical actions. These measures have enabled to extract rules to control the nonverbal behavior of a PA.",,第4页.xls
155,Intelligent agent-supported knowledge management,2006,"Knowledge management (KM) has been getting more and more attention from industry and the academy. Various kinds of KM tools have been developed to support KM activities. With these tools, knowledge workers share knowledge and information. These tools and related activities (e.g. management and organisation of discussion forums) achieve significant success and receive great business benefits. However, the existing KM tools are far from enough; most tools only supply a communication platform, and much creative knowledge work still depends entirely on human activities. Obviously, the mental stability of humans significantly affects how knowledge workers perform. Therefore, more sophisticated and intelligent support to knowledge-related activities is needed. This paper discusses the current KM practice and the important role of intelligent agents in KM. Further, the trend and important issues of intelligent-agent supported KM are analysed.",,第4页.xls
156,Fast conflict resolution based on reinforcement learning in multi-agent system,2004,"In multi-agent system where each agent has a different goal (even the team of agents has the same goal), agents must be able to resolve conflicts arising in the process of achieving their goal. Many researchers presented methods for conflict resolution, e.g., Reinforcement learning (RL), but the conventional RL requires a large computation cost because every agent must learn, at the same time the overlap of actions selected by each agent results in local conflict. Therefore in this paper, we propose a novel method to solve these problems.In order to deal with the conflict within the multi-agent system, the concept of potential field function based Action selection priority level (ASPL) is brought forward. In this method, all kinds of environment factor that may have influence on the priority are effectively computed with the potential field function. So the priority to access the local resource can be decided rapidly. By avoiding the complex coordination mechanism used in general multi-agent system, the conflict in multi-agent system is settled more efficiently.Our system consists of RL with ASPL module and generalized rules module. Using ASPL, RL module chooses a proper cooperative behavior, and generalized rule module can accelerate the learning process. By applying the proposed method to Robot Soccer, the learning process can be accelerated. The results of simulation and real experiments indicate the effectiveness of the method.",,第4页.xls
157,Humans and robots together: engineering sociality and collaboration,2020,"Intelligent agents and robots will become part of our daily lives. As they do, they will not only carry out specific tasks in the environment but also to partner with us socially and collaboratively. Groups of social robots may interact with groups of humans performing joint activities. Yet, research related to hybrid groups of humans and robots is still limited. What does it mean to be part of a hybrid group? Can social robots team up with humans? How do humans respond to social robots as partners? Do humans trust them? To research these questions we need a deep understanding of how robots can interact socially in group. That involves being able to identify and characterize group members, evaluate the dependencies between the behaviors of different members, understand and consider different roles, and infer the dynamics of group interactions in a group, led by a common past to build an anticipated future.In this talk I will discuss how to engineer social robots that act autonomously as members of a group collaborating with both humans and other robots. Different aspects need to be considered: what type of interaction mechanisms need to be built in the social robots to act in groups; how to build the capabilities that makes them able to perceive, identify and understand the human members of a group; how to model and retain information about past shared experiences of a group; how to model and adapt to the emotions of a group; and how to allow for a robot to respond to the dynamics of social interactions [Correia et al. 2019].I will start by providing an overview of recent research in social human-robot teams, and present different scenarios to illustrate the work. I will explore the application in the context of education [Alves-Oliveira et al. 2019] and entertainment [Correia et al. 2016] [Oliveira et al. 2018], describing how autonomous robotic partners may take into account different preferences and characteristics by the humans, and act in a social manner respecting the group's characteristics [Correia et al. 2018].",,第4页.xls
158,Software solutions for distributed autonomous multi-functional robotics in space,2016,"Robotics systems in space must deal with a host of software challenges in addition to and amplified by the challenges of a hostile space environment and the remoteness in which they operate. Software automation has been used to good effect in managing some of these challenges to control single robotic systems, even multi-functional systems, in previous unmanned missions without the physical presence of human operators. However, these previous control software artifacts tend to be platform-specific, single-system-focused and not really applicable to multi-agent teams of multi-functional, multi-generational robotic systems. In this paper, we discuss a software architecture based on the Multi-Agent Distributed Adaptive Resource Allocation1(MADARA) and Group Autonomy for Mobile Systems2(GAMS) open source middleware projects that is intended to be deployed in a multi-agent, multi-functional robotic system called the Keck Institute for Space Studies Multi-Planetary Smart Tile.

159,An agent-based decision network for concurrent engineering design,2001,"Engineering design is a complex process. Even in designing a simple product, many decisions must be made by a designer. The problem gets more complex when multiple designers work as a team to design single artifact. In this paper, we take a decision-based approach to model design process and introduce an agent-based decision network (ADN) to support concurrent decision-making and collaboration in design. ADN focuses on making designers consider other team members' decisions when making their own and attempts to achieve coherent design decisions among designers by explicitly representing and enhancing individual design decision-making and negotiation processes. ADN is composed of a decision-based design process model (DDPM), an objective-based negotiation model (OBNM), and a number of intelligent agents, each associated with a human designer. The DDPM was developed to capture individual designers' design processes. OBNM was developed to facilitate objective-based negotiation and to track both dependencies generated and decisions made at each design stage for downstream negotiation support. In ADN, each designer is associated with an agent and both the DDPM and OBNM are captured and facilitated by agents and are not explicitly visible to designers. Agents generate and utilize the DDPM and OBNM information to support their designers. This paper describes the ADN framework in detail, points out its advantages, and presents an application example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ADN framework.",,第4页.xls
160,A study of multiagent system operation within dynamic ad hoc networks,2008,"Two enabling technologies for envisioned tactical network systems are mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing and collaborative multiagent systems (MAS). Despite their respective technical value in enabling more distributed, autonomous networking, open research and engineering questions remain regarding robust interoperation, standardization, and design of these two technologies. Little work has been done to date to examine the interaction and performance of distributed agent designs within MANET environments. This paper examines the interactions and effects of running a team of belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents within a wireless network using emerging MANET protocol frameworks. The focus of the interagent communication model applied in this study is a form of MANET multicast routing and is aimed at improving group-based agent collaboration.

However, the implementation of chatbot technology in the health care system is unclear due to the scarce analysis of publications on the adoption of chatbot in health and medical settings.OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a protocol of a bibliometric analysis aimed at offering the public insights into the current state and emerging trends in research related to the use of chatbot technology for promoting health.METHODS: In this bibliometric analysis, we will select published papers from the databases of CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science that pertain to chatbot technology and its applications in health care. Our search strategy includes keywords such as chatbot, virtual agent, virtual assistant, conversational agent, conversational AI, interactive agent, health, and healthcare. Five researchers who are AI engineers and clinicians will independently review the titles and abstracts of selected papers to determine their eligibility for a full-text review. The corresponding author (ZN) will serve as a mediator to address any discrepancies and disputes among the 5 reviewers. Our analysis will encompass various publication patterns of chatbot research, including the number of annual publications, their geographic or institutional distribution, and the number of annual grants supporting chatbot research, and further summarize the methodologies used in the development of health-related chatbots, along with their features and applications in health care settings. Software tool VOSViewer (version 1.6.19; Leiden University) will be used to construct and visualize bibliometric networks.RESULTS: The preparation for the bibliometric analysis began on December 3, 2021, when the research team started the process of familiarizing themselves with the software tools that may be used in this analysis, VOSViewer and CiteSpace, during which they consulted 3 librarians at the Yale University regarding search terms and tentative results. Tentative searches on the aforementioned databases yielded a total of 2340 papers. The official search phase started on July 27, 2023. Our goal is to complete the screening of papers and the analysis by February 15, 2024.CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence chatbots, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI Inc), have sparked numerous discussions within the health care industry regarding their impact on human health. Chatbot technology holds substantial promise for advancing health care systems worldwide. However, developing a sophisticated chatbot capable of precise interaction with health care consumers, delivering personalized care, and providing accurate health-related information and knowledge remain considerable challenges.

163,Autonomous protection mechanism for joint networks in coalition operations,2007,"Any successful coalition cooperation requires efficient communication network connecting the coalition members. Protection of this joint network requires special techniques as it is highly dynamic, heterogenous and a joint network management team can not always be established. To address the requirements for joint network protection, we propose a design of a highly autonomous, adaptive and decentralized agent-based mechanism for network intrusion detection and self-protection. Detection process is based on correlation of anomalies in network traffic with simple alarms raised by host-based intrusion detection components, in order to achieve a low false positive rate. The self-protection mechanism features distributed, policy driven deployment of automatically generated filters. Our approach doesn't require any direct operator oversight, but all components are subject to policies established by their owners to prevent undesirable behavior or system misuse. The whole approach is validated in a high-level network model with worm propagation scenario.",,第4页.xls

However, the main drawbacks of currently deployed e-Health monitoring systems originate from the fact that patients are 'constrained' within smart rooms and beds fitted with monitoring devices. Such monitoring is not ubiquitous in view of the privacy, mobility and flexibility issues concerning patients. On the other hand, health monitoring products strapped to the patient's body provide no analysis or recommendations of results. A multi-agent architecture for mobile health monitoring is presented, involving a team of intelligent agents that collate patient data, reason collectively and recommend actions to patients and medical staff in a mobile environment.",,第4页.xls
165,T3OMVP: A Transformer-Based Time and Team Reinforcement Learning Scheme for Observation-Constrained Multi-Vehicle Pursuit in Urban Area,2022,"Smart Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) will contribute to vehicle decision-making in the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Multi-vehicle pursuit (MVP) games, a multi-vehicle cooperative ability to capture mobile targets, are gradually becoming a hot research topic. Although there are some achievements in the field of MVP in the open space environment, the urban area brings complicated road structures and restricted moving spaces as challenges to the resolution of MVP games. We define an observation-constrained MVP (OMVP) problem in this paper and propose a transformer-based time and team reinforcement learning scheme ((TOMVP)-O-3) to address the problem. First, a new multi-vehicle pursuit model is constructed based on Decentralized Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) to instantiate this problem. Second, the QMIX is redefined to deal with the OMVP problem by leveraging the transformer-based observation sequence and combining the vehicle's observations to reduce the influence of constrained observations. Third, a simulated urban environment is built to verify the proposed scheme. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed (TOMVP)-O-3 scheme achieves improvements relative to the state-of-the-art QMIX approaches by 9.66 similar to 106.25%, from simple to difficult scenarios.",,第4页.xls
166,MLIMAS: A Framework for Machine Learning in Interactive Multi-Agent Systems,2015,"Multi-agent systems in complex, real time domains require agents to act effectively both autonomously and as part of a team. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with pre-programmed agent behaviors. The agents must instead discover a solution on their own, using learning. In this paper, we present MLIMAS a framework for Machine Learning in Interactive Multi-Agent Systems. The MLIMAS is proposed to provide answers to the issues arising from integrating machine learning algorithms in interactive multi-agent systems, focusing on three questions i) what are the learning targets for agents?, (ii) how can the machine learning system be integrated into the agent architecture?, and (iii) how can agents learn interactively?. MLIMAS addresses those three questions plus supporting multi-agent systems consisting of autonomous and adaptive agents acting in real-time and noisy environments. As a result of such required capabilities, MLIMAS allows dynamic and intelligent behavior of the agents to efficiently achieve their local and coalition goals such through modeling other agents actions, and interactively taking benefits of self and others preferences in learning and achieving the agents goals. We studied the proposed framework in the Taxi Domain compared with the traditional Q-Learning algorithm without interactive share of information. Our experiments showed 2 times improvement for the average award received per agents trail rather than the traditional Q-Learning approach. In addition, we have got %80 improvement for the same number of trials of the agents to reach the passengers. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",,第4页.xls

168,Research on dynamic team formation for multirobot based on Reinforcement Learning,2002,"In the field of the artificial intelligence, more and more attention has been paid to the Reinforcement Learning algorithm with the advantage of its self-learning and self-adaptability. With the development of the multiagent theory in distributed artificial intelligence, the distributed Reinforcement Learning is becoming the focus of this research. In this paper, the state of the Reinforcement Learning algorithm research is illustrated here first. Then the model of the multi-robots' team formation is used as the study model to illuminate the high-level behavior control of the robots with the usage of the Reinforcement Learning. Now, few people apply this way to solve such problem. In the Reinforcement Learning algorithm explained here, the inside reinforcement signals and outside reinforcement signals are applied to show the interests of the robot and its whole group. The control system of the robot is composed of the high-level behavior control and the low-level action control. With this multi-layer control, the task of every part is clear. In the low-level action control, the fuzzy control is used here for the mechanical character of the robot. After using the multi-layer architecture and fuzzy control algorithm, the speed of learning and convergence of the reinforcement is faster. At last the simulation prove the validity of the algorithm.",,第4页.xls
169,Chatbot-mediated Learning: Conceptual Framework for the Design of Chatbot Use Cases in Education,2022,"While chatbots or conversational agents are already common in many business areas, e.g. for customer support, their use in the education sector is still in its infancy. Chatbots might take over the role of a teacher, tutor, conversational partner, learning analyst, team member, support assistant, or recommender system. Within these different roles, chatbots can enhance learning and inherently address many requirements and success factors for learning. The scalability and adaptiveness of conversational AI allow an individualised learning support for all learners combined with collaboration opportunities and thus more equality in education. In this context, the paper at hand discusses this pedagogical potential of chatbots in different roles and social settings resulting in a conceptual framework for the understanding and design of chatbot use cases in education. Based on success factors for learning derived from established learning theories and reports, core attributes and goals of chatbot learning are deducted within three pedagogical domains of individual, social and analytic chatbot learning. By combining this pedagogical dimension with a technological and content dimension, the presented conceptual framework provides an overview of possibilities of how chatbots in education can be used and designed.",,第4页.xls
170,Decision making for multi-objective multi-agent search and rescue missions,2017,"In this paper we introduce a novel rewarding scheme for the classical POMDP formulation. The proposed scheme aims to reinforce preference of objectives. It ensures that a high-priority preferences get high accumulative rewards, solve ambiguities and it can be conducted before the low-priority-preference. In order to show conflicting of objectives, context of search and rescue has been selected for this paper. It involves heterogeneous team with potential conflicting multiobjective situations. Our rewarding scheme has been tested in simulated scenarios using multiple POMDP solvers. Results obtained from the simulated experiments show that the system is able to represent an impact on the human (first responder) through enforcing priority of objectives and iteratively optimize policies to better suit the first responder and the search and rescue mission goals.",,第4页.xls
171,Multiagent knowledge-based environment for concurrent engineering applications,1996,"The systematic integration of humans with the tools, resources, and information assets of an organization is fundamental to concurrent engineering (CE). In an integrated environment, all entities must first be connected, and they then must work cooperatively. Services that support concurrencythrough communication, team coordination, information sharing, and integrationin an interactive and formerly serial product development process provide the foundation for a CE environment. Product developers working concurrently in their application domains need built-in tools and operated-in tools in a computer-aided CE environment.

To solve the problem of real time motion planning and control of several mobile robots, it is necessary to apply methods of neural control, combined with artificial intelligence (AI). The control system may be of single-level type (with equal robots) and two-level type with a special coordinator (supervisor), which provides motion coordination for individual robots. The main and most difficult problem of optimal control of a robot team is to plan robots motion, concerning both obstacles in the working zone and other moving robots. In mathematical sense the problem can be considered as optimization of the whole system functional which consists of individual robot functionals with constraint of some common resources. For a group of mobile robots such resources are represented by a free space in the working zone.",,第4页.xls
173,Towards Addressing Model Uncertainty: Robust Execution-Time Coordination for Teamwork,2011,"Despite their worst-case NEXP-complete planning complexity, DEC-POMDPs remain a popular framework for multiagent teamwork. This paper introduces effective teamwork under model uncertainty (i.e., potentially inaccurate transition and observation functions) as a novel challenge for DEC-POMDPs and presents MODERN, the first execution-centric framework for DEC-POMDPs explicitly motivated by addressing such model uncertainty. MODERN's shift of coordination reasoning from planning-time to execution-time avoids the high cost of computing optimal plans whose promised quality may not be realized in practice. There are three key ideas in MODERN: (i) it maintains an exponentially smaller model of other agents' beliefs and actions than in previous work and then further reduces the computation-time and space expense of this model via bounded pruning, (ii) it reduces execution-time computation by exploiting BDI theories of teamwork, and limits communication to key trigger points, and (iii) it limits its decision-theoretic reasoning about communication to trigger points and uses a systematic markup to encourage extra communication at these points -- thus reducing uncertainty among team members at trigger points. We empirically show that MODERN is substantially faster than existing DEC-POMDP execution-centric methods while achieving significantly higher reward.",,第4页.xls
174,Catalyst.RL: a distributed framework for reproducible RL research [arXiv],2019,"Despite the recent progress in deep reinforcement learning field (RL), and, arguably because of it, a large body of work remains to be done in reproducing and carefully comparing different RL algorithms.

Main features of our library include large-scale asynchronous distributed training, easy-to-use configuration files with the complete list of hyperparameters for the particular experiments, efficient implementations of various RL algorithms and auxiliary tricks, such as frame stacking, n-step returns, value distributions, etc. To vindicate the usefulness of our framework, we evaluate it on a range of benchmarks in a continuous control, as well as on the task of developing a controller to enable a physiologically-based human model with a prosthetic leg to walk and run.

175,An agent-oriented decision support system combining fuzzy clustering and the AHP,2011,"Decision making is a complex process, particularly when it is carried out by multidisciplinary team. Methods based on the analytical hierarchy process have been widely employed because they provide solid mathematical background. Nevertheless, solutions such as the Aggregation of Individual Judgements (AIJ) and the Aggregation of Individual Priorities (AIP) do not offer sufficient explanatory data in regards with the final decision. We developed an agent-based decision support system (DSS) that employs fuzzy clustering to group individual evaluations and the AHP to reach a final decision. Fuzzy clustering is adequate to determine important pieces of data such as the largest group of evaluations that exist around a centroid value. On the other hand, the MAS paradigm offers capabilities for achieving distributed and asynchronous processing of data. The AHP is used after the individual evaluations are clustered, as if the group were a single evaluator. Altogether, the proposed solution enhances the quality of multi-criteria group decision making. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls

The management strategies established for each type of stakeholders were formalised and the impact of these strategies on biodiversity was analyzed at various temporal and spatial scales. Following a short description of the model, three aspects of the modelling process are discussed in more detail: the use of the chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) population as a representative variable for the interactions between stakeholders and territory, the use of nonmonetary economic indicators, and the ways that multi-disciplinary scientific knowledge can be integrated into the model.

177,Hierarchical concurrent engineering in a multiagent framework,1996,"Our experience indicates coordination in concurrent engineering (CE) requires support for two types of relationships among decision makers: supervisor/subordinate and peer-to-peer. Supervisor/subordinate relationships are created by the standard hierarchical decomposition process that is required to solve any large design problem. Peer-to-peer relationships arise when teams of decision makers must interact, without direct guidance, to achieve individual and common goals. In this paper, we describe a general decision-making methodology, which we call hierarchical CE. The emphasis of hierarchical CE is to provide support for both supervisor/subordinate and peel-to-peer relationships. In addition to the concept of hierarchical CE, we present a supporting agent-based framework in which the preferences and constraints of a design supervisor are distributed to design subordinates, who are expected to exploit their local expertise within the context provided by this global information. A distinct separation between feasibility and value facilitates optimal decision-making by design agents, since the bounds on feasibility do not include arbitrary statements about value. This distinction may prove useful for other problem domains as well.",,第4页.xls
178,Decentralized Bayesian learning in dynamic games,2016,"We study the problem of Bayesian learning in a dynamical system involving strategic agents with asymmetric information. In a series of seminal papers in the literature, this problem has been studied under a simplifying model where selfish players appear sequentially and act once in the game, based on private noisy observations of the system state and public observation of past players' actions. It is shown that there exist information cascades where users discard their private information and mimic the action of their predecessor. In this paper, we provide a framework for studying Bayesian learning dynamics in a more general setting than the one described above. In particular, our model incorporates cases where players participate for the whole duration of the game, and cases where an endogenous process selects which sub-set of players will act at each time instance. The proposed methodology hinges on a sequential decomposition for finding perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) of a general class of dynamic games with asymmetric information, where user-specific states evolve as conditionally independent Markov processes and users make independent noisy observations of their states. Using our methodology, we study a specific dynamic learning model where players make decisions about investing in the team, based on their estimates of everyone's types. We characterize a set of informational cascades for this problem where learning stops for the team as a whole.",,第4页.xls
179,Supporting Software Project Management Processes Using the Agent System,2010,"The natural development of information technology area stimulates intense growth of various technologies which support basic organization processes. The range of technologies implies appropriate management thereof, as well as accurate correspondence with conducted activities. Abandonment of activities within individual branches in favour of project approach to performed assignments (especially those connected with software development) has recently become a popular subject of management. This approach involves a variety of technologies which support project tasks. Yet the question arises, how to harmonize proper technologies with project management in an effective way. Agent system that is built by authors is a kind of solution to this problem. That system is a kind of tool which serves to help project managers with the choice of a proper method and technology of project management. One of most important decision taken before project start is method and tools selection. When method is not fitted to project team it can provide to project's failure. Also many times client's knowledge about IT project area can be important for getting success.",,第4页.xls
180,On interactive computation: intelligent tutoring systems - (Extended abstract),1999,"This talk will give an overview of an interdisciplinary research project being developed at The University of Memphis, led by a team of computer scientists, psychologists, and educators. The project's goal is to research and develop prototypes for an intelligent autonomous soft ware agent capable of tutoring a human user on a narrow, but fairly open, domain of expertise. The chosen prototype domain is computer literacy. The agent interacts with the user in natural language and other modalities. It receives input in typewritten form, possesses a good deal of syntactic and semantic capabilities to interpret inputs in context relevant fashion, select appropriate responses (short feedback, dialog moves), and completes the dialog cycle in multimodal form (feedback delivered in short spoken expressions and/or facial gestures, spoken information delivery and pointing to appropriate illustrations, animations, etc.). The performance of the agent is expected to be consistent with the level of performance of untrained human tutors.

182,Hybrid Multi-Agent Strategy Discovering Algorithm for human behavior,2017,"Training in simulators through serious games is widely used in domains where it is too dangerous to train in a real environment. Simulations can help to model complex social and psychological aspects and can enable repetitiveness during game-based learning, which is especially important when opposing or cooperating humans can get hurt. When a trainee team interacts with other humans or software agents with human-like performance, cognitive and psychological properties and interactions that arise in various situations play an important role in serious game training. Therefore, special tools and methods that integrate physical and cognitive activities need to be developed in order to analyze the way trainees tackle the scenario. We have addressed these problems with the Hybrid Multi-Agent Strategy Discovering Algorithm (HMASDA), which builds upon an existing algorithm for physical strategy identification (MASDA) by adding the ability to process and consider cognitive models. To include the cognitive behavior of trainees, and to identify integrated policies based on their overall behavior, we introduced additional features that take into account the trainees' cognitive state, their well-being, and their emotional reactions. Using a predefined asymmetric conflict scenario, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain physical and cognitive descriptions of the behavior that trainees display. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

183,AN INTERACTIVE CONTROL ARCHITECTURE FOR MOBILE ROBOTS,2013,"Programming a robot to handle daily-life tasks in a dynamic changing environment with versatile and responsive behaviours is challenging. An intelligent robot needs to integrate many heterogeneous modules of various features using a powerful control architecture. This study aims to develop a methodology for designing a flexible real-time robot control system using an agent-based approach. The proposed control architecture decomposes a complex robotic control system into agents and allows heterogeneous modules to he integrated more efficiently. The software framework solves resource sharing, message flow and coding problems, and helps to integrate separate processes into a whole system with less effort. The proposed core components guarantee real-time response and high performance of the robotic system.

184,Contradiction of modern and social-humanitarian artificial intelligence,2022,"Purpose The purpose of the paper is to propose an effective approach of artificial intelligence (AI) addressing social-humanitarian reality comprising non-formalizable representation. The new task is to describe processes of integration of AI and humans in the hybrid systems framework. Design/methodology/approach Social-humanitarian dynamics contradict traditional characteristics of AI. Suggested methodology embraces formalized and non-formalized parts as a whole. Holonic and special convergent approaches are combined to ensure purposefulness and sustainability of collective decision-making. Inverse problem solving on topology spaces, control thermodynamics and non-formalizable (considering quantum and relativistic) semantics include observers of eigenforms of reality. Findings Collective decision-making cannot be represented only by formal means. Thus, this paper suggests the equation of hybrid reality (HyR), which integrates formalizable and non-formalizable parts conveying and coalescing holonic approaches, thermodynamic theory, cognitive modeling and inverse problem solving. The special convergent approach makes the solution of this equation purposeful and sustainable. Research limitations/implications The suggested approach is far reaching with respect of current state-of-the-art technology; medium-term limitations are expected in the creation of cognitive semantics. Practical implications Social-humanitarian events embrace all phenomena connected with individual and collective human behavior and decision-making. The paper will impact deeply networked experts, groups of crowds, rescue teams, researchers, professional communities, society and environment. Originality/value New possibilities for advanced AI to enable purposeful and sustainable social-humanitarian subjects.

185,A hybrid multi-agent system architecture for enterprise integration using computer networks,2005,"The manufacturing industries are now experiencing fierce pressure of competition from every corner on this planet. In addition, the advancement in computer networks and information technologies has been gradually reshaping the manufacturing companies by shifting from the industrial age to the information era. Due to these elevated competitiveness and advanced computer technology, a number of new manufacturing and management strategies (e.g., CE or CIM) have emerged for the innovation of manufacturing enterprises. Although they have different definitions and scopes, there are several common issues: inter-enterprise functions integration; inter-enterprise resources integration; and collaboration. This paper proposes a new multi-agent system (MAS) architecture to support the inter-enterprise functions/resources integration and collaboration over the networked environment, including the hybrid agent architecture and hybrid network architecture. In contrast to the existing agent architectures, the proposed agent architecture enables agents to exhibit the hybrid (continuous and discrete) behavior and interactions. In addition, our network architecture is more suitable for building the large-scale distributed manufacturing systems that are prone to dynamic random changes of their environment. Based on the proposed MAS architecture, a collaborative product development environment is implemented as a starting point, and a multidisciplinary team-oriented design problem is illustrated to provide the vision of the proposed MAS architecture.

186,Learning Cooperative Visual Dialog Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning,2017,"We introduce the first goal-driven training for visual question answering and dialog agents. Specifically, we pose a cooperative 'image guessing' game between two agents - Q-BOT and A-BOT-who communicate in natural language dialog so that Q-BOT can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end - from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.We demonstrate two experimental results.First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabularies, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among 'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset [5], where we pretrain on dialog data with supervised learning (SL) and show that the RL fine-tuned agents significantly outperform supervised pretraining. Interestingly, the RL Q-BOT learns to ask questions that A-BOT is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.",,第4页.xls
187,The importance of procedural justice in Human-Machine Interactions: intelligent systems as new decision agents in organizations,2018,"In the present study, the effects of procedural justice (fair or unfair) and the type of decision agent (human, robot, or computer) on employee behavior and attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, or counterproductive work behaviors) were examined. It was predicted that the type of decision agent (or the source of justice) would moderate the relationship between procedural justice and employee behavior and attitudes, with the relationship being strongest when the decision agent is a human team leader, medium when the decision agent is a humanoid robot, and weakest when the agent is a computer system. This research question was investigated with a between-subjects design in two experiments (N1= 149 andN2= 145) that displayed two different decision situations in organizations (allocation of new tasks and allocation of further vocational trainings). Results of both studies showed significant effects of procedural justice on employee behavior and attitudes, confirming the importance of procedural justice at the workplace for both human and system decision agents. Furthermore, both studies failed to verify any interaction effects of procedural justice and the decision agent. This further emphasizes the importance of procedural justice in decision situations because there is no difference in reactions to procedural justice of human or system decisions. Limitations and implications for future research and the integration of justice and human-machine interaction research are discussed. [All rights reserved Elsevier].",,第4页.xls

189,Multi-agent hierarchical architecture modeling kinematic chains employing continuous RL learning with fuzzified state space,2008,"In the context of multi-agent systems, we are proposing a hierarchical robot control architecture that comprises artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and traditional control methodologies, based on the realization of a learning team of agents in a continuous problem setting. In a multi-agent system, action selection is important for cooperation and coordination among the agents. By employing reinforcement learning (RL) methods in a fuzzified state-space, we accomplish to design a control architecture and a corresponding methodology, engaged in a continuous space, which enables the agents to learn, over a period of time, to perform sequences of continuous actions in a cooperative manner, in order to reach their goal without any prior generated task model. By organizing the agents in a nested architecture, as proposed in this work, a type of problem-specific recursive knowledge acquisition is attempted. Furthermore, the agents try to exploit the knowledge gathered in order to be in position to execute tasks that indicate certain degree of similarity. The agents correspond in fact to independent degrees of freedom of the system, and achieve to gain experience over the task that they collaboratively perform, by exploring and exploiting their state-to-action mapping space. A numerical experiment is presented in this paper, performed on a simulated planar 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator, in order to evaluate both the proposed hierarchical multi-agent architecture as well as the proposed methodological framework. It is anticipated that such an approach can be highly scalable for the control of robotic systems that are kinematically more complex, comprising multiple DOFs and potentially redundancies in open or closed kinematic chains, particularly dexterous manipulators.",,第4页.xls

191,A cooperative receding horizon controller for multivehicle uncertain environments,2006,"We consider a setting where multiple vehicles form a team cooperating to visit multiple target points and collect rewards associated with them. The team objective is to maximize the total reward accumulated over a given time interval. Complicating factors include uncertainties regarding the locations of target points and the effectiveness of collecting rewards, differences among vehicle capabilities, and the fact that rewards are time-varying. We propose a receding horizon (RH) controller suitable for dynamic and uncertain environments, where combinatorially complex assignment algorithms are infeasible. The control scheme dynamically determines vehicle trajectories by solving a sequence of optimization problems over a planning horizon and executing them over a shorter action horizon. This centralized scheme can generate stationary trajectories in the sense that they guide vehicles to target points, even though the controller is not explicitly designed to perform any discrete point assignments. This paper establishes conditions under which this stationarity property holds in settings that are analytically tractable, quantifies the cooperative properties of the controller, and includes a number of illustrative simulation examples.",,第4页.xls

Prospective Health Technology Assessment (ProHTA) is a new approach that combines the knowledge of an interdisciplinary team and uses simulation techniques to indicate the effects of new innovations early before the expensive and risky development phase begins.

193,Evolution of Complex Coordinated Behavior,2020,"Cooperative tasks such as herding and hunting are common among higher animals in nature. A particularly complex example is that of mobbing by spotted hyenas. Through careful coordination, a large number of spotted hyenas can attack a group of lions and successfully steal a kill from them, even though lions are much bigger and stronger. This behavior is more complex than others that hyenas exhibit, and it appears to be heritable. How such behavioral advance can emerge in evolution is a fascinating question; it is difficult to study in nature, but computational simulations can provide insight. In simulation, hyenas initially evolved different levels of boldness, corresponding to simple behaviors such as solo attack, delayed attack, and delayed approach. These behaviors can be seen as stepping stones in constructing the more complex mobbing behavior in later generations. These results suggest a general stepping-stone-based mechanism through which complex coordinated behaviors can arise in humans and animals. This insight should prove useful in building cognitive architectures and team strategies for artificial agents in the future.",,第4页.xls

The experimenter can set general parameters, configure the interface, specify the model, insert events and define the resources and capabilities of each player using the scenario development tool. No programming skills are required. Task complexity can be varied by introducing feedback loops, delayed effects, time pressure, situational uncertainty, adjusting model transparency and changing the relationships between system elements. CODEM creates detailed logs of events and actions essential for cognitive process tracing and the evaluation of decision making effectiveness. The first task designed with CODEM is a counter-insurgency scenario in which a coalition force seeks to stabilize a failing state. A genetic algorithm is used to estimate the best strategy in that scenario for comparison with human results. An adversarial version also allows insurgents to be controlled by a human opponent (or a red team) rather than an artificial agent. CODEM can be used as a cognitive engineering testbed and as a training environment for improving decision making and adaptation skills in complex situations.",,第4页.xls

The purpose is to propose methods and tools in order to help designers to optimize and to evaluate design parameters according to technical specifications during the embodiment design phase. For this purpose, multi-agent systems are interesting because of their ability to virtually duplicate the process followed by designers' teams. Because of the high number of parameters and possible combinations, a hybrid search approach based on metaheuristic mechanisms is proposed for optimization. More particularly when the task is a multiple objective combinatorial optimization and preference order cannot be defined, the objective functions of the criteria to optimize cannot be weighted and optimization cannot be resumed to a single-objective one. We specified a hybrid algorithm deriving the best (not dominated) solutions set: the Pareto front, from the possible solutions set. Self-organizing maps are then used to analyze and evaluate the obtained front. Our approach is illustrated in the case of the design of a 2-degrees of freedom robot.",,第4页.xls
198,An analytic environment for systemic risk - risk modeling support for financial policy makers,2012,"Systemic risk in the U.S. financial system has drawn the attention of leaders in government and business alike. The abundance of systemic risk measures and risk models has added to the complex task of understanding, discussing, and acting on the implications of that risk. Tools that assist decision makers to interpret risk measures, and recognize their underlying assumptions may lead to deeper understanding and more effective discussion. This paper describes some initial considerations for building an integrated modeling and analysis environment to aid in assessing complex financial data. The modeling environment is engineered to support execution of quantitative models including agent based and network models against equivalent scenarios of economic conditions. The environment provides tools to compare and visualize model outputs, and to allow decision makers to maintain traceability from model outputs back to their underlying assumptions. This capability may facilitate the operation of a modeling forum where disparate teams of analysts can collaborate to provide insights into the nation's exposure to systemic financial risk.",,第4页.xls
199,Using Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) in Understanding Current User-Support Scenario in the Climate Science Domain of Cyber-Infrastructures,2014,"Cyber-infrastructures have transformed the practice of research. Researchers can now access distributed data worldwide with the help of cyber-infrastructures. User support services play an important role to facilitate researchers to accomplish their research goals with the help of cyber-infrastructures. However, the current user-support practices in cyber-infrastructures are not properly organized (at least in climate cyber-infrastructures) thus over-burdening human support agents. The paper describes the study conducted to evaluate the geographically distributed user-support system currently in practice in the leading cyber-infrastructure namely Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). The members of the investigation team found out that the user-support in ESGF, a global climate cyber-infrastructure need more attention to make it resourceful as well as standardized. The findings about end-user support system were modelled using soft systems methodology (SSM). This approach helped to present the findings of this study to stakeholders in order to capture their feedback about the current system to further improve the system.",,第4页.xls
200,Guardian: a prototype intelligent agent for intensive care-monitoring,1992,"Effective monitoring of device-supported patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is complex, involving interpretation of many variables, comparative evaluation of many therapy options, and control of many patient-management parameters. A growing body of research aims to improve ICU monitoring with computer technology. The authors' project aims to develop a more comprehensive intelligent agent, having a broad range of capabilities, to cooperate on the ICU team. They do not aim to produce a practical system suitable for near-term deployment in the ICU, but rather a `proof of concept', an experimental system that: demonstrably performs and coordinates a range of intelligent reasoning tasks of use in ICU monitoring; does so reliably in a significant range of medical situations; and arguably will scale up to meet the comprehensive set of practical requirements with an appropriate development effort. They have developed an experimental system called Guardian, which exhibits several of the required capabilities and utilizes an underlying architecture hypothesized to support the full range of required capabilities. They describe the Guardian system, its architecture, and its current knowledge base. They then describe its performance and planned research.",,第4页.xls
201,ACTION FAILURE RECOVERY VIA MODEL-BASED DIAGNOSIS AND CONFORMANT PLANNING,2013,"A plan carried on in the real world may be affected by a number of unexpected events, plan threats, which cause significant deviations between the intended behavior of the plan executor (i.e., the agent) and the observed one. These deviations are typically considered as action failures. This paper addresses the problem of recovering from action failures caused by a specific class of plan threats: faults in the functionalities of the agent. The problem is approached by exploiting techniques of the Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) for detecting failures (plan execution monitoring) and for explaining these failures in terms of faulty functionalities (agent diagnosis). The recovery process is modeled as a replanning problem aimed at fixing the faulty components identified by the agent diagnosis. However, since the diagnosis is in general ambiguous (a failure may be explained by alternative faults), the recovery has to deal with such an uncertainty. The paper advocates the adoption of a conformant planner, which guarantees that the recovery plan, if it exists, is executable no matter what the actual cause of the failure. The paper focuses on a single agent performing its own plan, however the proposed methodology takes also into account that agents are typically situated into a multiagent scenario and that commitments between agents may exist. The repair strategy is therefore conceived to overcome the causes of a failure while assuring the commitments an agent has agreed with other team members.",,第4页.xls
202,Evaluating practical negotiating agents: Results and analysis of the 2011 international competition,2013,"This paper presents an in-depth analysis and the key insights gained from the Second International Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC 2011). ANAC is an international competition that challenges researchers to develop successful automated negotiation agents for scenarios where there is no information about the strategies and preferences of the opponents. The key objectives of this competition are to advance the state-of-the-art in the area of practical bilateral multi-issue negotiations, and to encourage the design of agents that are able to operate effectively across a variety of scenarios. Eighteen teams from seven different institutes competed. This paper describes these agents, the setup of the tournament, including the negotiation scenarios used, and the results of both the qualifying and final rounds of the tournament. We then go on to analyse the different strategies and techniques employed by the participants using two methods: (i) we classify the agents with respect to their concession behaviour against a set of standard benchmark strategies and (ii) we employ empirical game theory (EGT) to investigate the robustness of the strategies. Our analysis of the competition results allows us to highlight several interesting insights for the broader automated negotiation community. In particular, we show that the most adaptive negotiation strategies, while robust across different opponents, are not necessarily the ones that win the competition. Furthermore, our EGT analysis highlights the importance of considering metrics, in addition to utility maximisation (such as the size of the basin of attraction), in determining what makes a successful and robust negotiation agent for practical settings.

203,A new concept for disruption management in airline operations control,2011,"The Airline Operations Control Centre (AOCC) of an airline company is the organization responsible for monitoring and solving operational problems. It includes teams of human experts specialized in solving problems related with aircrafts, crewmembers, and passengers, in a process called disruption management or operations recovery. In this article, the authors propose a new concept for disruption management in this domain. The organization of the AOCC is represented by a multi-agent system (MAS), where roles that correspond to the most frequent tasks that could benefit from a cooperative approach, are performed by intelligent agents. The human experts, represented by agents that are able to interact with them, are part of this AOCC-MAS supervising the system and taking the final decision from the solutions proposed by the AOCC-MAS. The authors show the architecture of this AOCC-MAS, including the main costs involved and details about how the system takes decisions. They tested the concept, using several real airline crew-related problems and using four methods: human experts (traditional way), the AOCC-MAS with and without using quality-costs, and the integrated approach presented in this article. The results are presented and discussed.",,第4页.xls
204,Cooperative behavior acquisition for mobile robots in dynamically changing real worlds via vision-based reinforcement learning and development,1999,"In this paper, we first discuss the meaning of physical embodiment and the complexity of the environment in the context of multi-agent learning. We then propose a vision-based reinforcement learning method that acquires cooperative behaviors in a dynamic environment. We use the robot soccer game initiated by RoboCup (Kitano et al., 1997) to illustrate the effectiveness of our method. Each agent works with other team members to achieve a common goal against opponents. Our method estimates the relationships between a learner's behaviors and those of other agents in the environment through interactions (observations and actions) using a technique from system identification. In order to identify the model of each agent, Akaike's Information Criterion is applied to the results of Canonical Variate Analysis to clarify the relationship between the observed data in terms of actions and future observations. Next, reinforcement learning based on the estimated state vectors is performed to obtain the optimal behavior policy. The proposed method is applied to a soccer playing situation. The method successfully models a rolling ball and other moving agents and acquires the learner's behaviors. Computer simulations and real experiments are shown and a discussion is given.

205,Emerging role of aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting,2003,"Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been approved as second-line treatment for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer after first-line treatment with the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen. Anastrozole and letrozole have also recently been widely approved as first-line endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. The three third-generation selective oral AIs approved for use in the United States include two nonsteroidal agents, anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara), and the irreversible steroidal inhibitor exemestane (Aromasin). Several major ongoing clinical trials with a variety of treatment regimens are comparing the relative efficacy of tamoxifen with the steroidal and nonsteroidal AIs in the adjuvant setting. The first strategy compares an AI against tamoxifen directly. Among these are the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial (anastrozole), the BIG FEMTA (Femara-Tamoxifen Breast International Group) trial (letrozole), and the EXEM and TEAM (exemestane) trials. A second strategy is examining the use of an AI as an extension after the initial 5 years of tamoxifen. Examples of this trial design are the MA-17 (letrozole) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP B-33, exemestane) trials. A third approach is the use of these agents in sequence with tamoxifen as therapy within the initial 5 postoperative years. Examples of this approach are the International Collaboration Cancer Group trial (tamoxifen for 2-3 years followed by either tamoxifen or exemestane for the remainder of the 5-year period), the BIG FEMTA trial (patients are crossed over from tamoxifen to letrozole or letrozole to tamoxifen), and the Arimidex-Nolvadex (ARNO) trial (patients receiving tamoxifen are randomized either to continue with tamoxifen or to switch to anastrozole). A single trial is comparing tamoxifen and anastrozole as initial 5-year therapy, or a combination of the two. The study addressing this design is the ATAC trial. Finally, a small trial in Norway is comparing 2 years of an AI versus a placebo in very low-risk patients with receptor-positive breast tumors. Most adjuvant trials have companion studies associated with the main protocol. These are to determine the end-organ effects of the inhibitors and include measurements of quality of life, bone and lipid metabolism, and endometrial effects. This review addresses the clinical implications of these studies of AIs.",,第4页.xls

208,Safety considerations for small Unmanned Aerial Systems with distributed users,2014,"This paper identifies three categories of safety risks posed by allowing multiple users to engage with small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) and offers five recommendations on how to reduce or mitigate these vulnerabilities. Data from sUAS can benefit multiple experts at a disaster who may not be familiar with robots or colocated with the pilot. Two different styles of interfaces have been developed and tested with responders conducting exercises to facilitate team coordination with a quadrotor at Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service's Disaster City over a four year period. The two interfaces illustrate three distinct categories of safety concerns: unsafe control regimes, loss of situation awareness, and increased stress. Five recommendations are proposed to mitigate or eliminate the safety concerns: separate the payload camera from the platform, giving the pilot a dedicated pilot-cam and the experts a fully gimbaled payload; use artificial intelligence to resolve conflicts between competing directives from multiple experts; allow the pilot, or a software agent, to turn off the expert's ability to control or communication; use multi-modal warnings rather than rely on visual cues; and add guarded motion to prevent collisions.",,第4页.xls
209,Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Traffic Monitoring with a Team of Aerial Robots,2021,"This paper studies the traffic monitoring problem in a road network using a team of aerial robots. The problem is challenging due to two main reasons. First, the traffic events are stochastic, both temporally and spatially. Second, the problem has a non-homogeneous structure as the traffic events arrive at different locations of the road network at different rates. Accordingly, some locations require more visits by the robots compared to other locations. To address these issues, we define an uncertainty metric for each location of the road network and formulate a path planning problem for the aerial robots to minimize the network's average uncertainty. We express this problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a distributed and scalable algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to solve it. We consider two different scenarios depending on the communication mode between the agents (aerial robots) and the traffic management center (TMC). The first scenario assumes that the agents continuously communicate with the TMC to send/receive realtime information about the traffic events. Hence, the agents have global and real-time knowledge of the environment. However, in the second scenario, we consider a challenging setting where the observation of the aerial robots is partial and limited to their sensing ranges. Moreover, in contrast to the first scenario, the information exchange between the aerial robots and the TMC is restricted to specific time instances. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm in both scenarios for a real road network topology and demonstrate its functionality in a traffic monitoring system.",,第4页.xls
210,ICACIA: An Intelligent Context-Aware framework for COBOT in defense industry using ontological and deep learning models,2022,"Most of the world's most advanced defense technologies are robots, and the defence industry is slowly moving toward including AI in the military robots they build. For these smart robots to make their own decisions about where to go and what to do, they need to be limited by several algorithms that run continuously and at the same time. Autonomy is the range of automated systems that can be adapted to a specific mission, residual risk, and level of team cohesion between humans and robots. Self-driving robotic systems should be collaborative, which means they should be able to interact actively with humans in a shared space or in proximity to humans and robots. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) works better when these COBOTs are aware of their surroundings. Mobile Robot (MR) teams whose perceptual and cognitive abilities are very well developed can help a lot with context awareness. To work well with humans, these robots should know what is going on with their human and other robot teammates so they can make decisions on their own. Also, robots should be able to share information about their surroundings so that humans can benefit from a better understanding of the situation. At the same time, humans should be able to see what the robots are doing. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based framework for humans and robots to work together to understand the context of Defense missions. An ontological model of contexts for missions, agents, and situations; a knowledge base comprising all the tools necessary for a sort of situation; and an efficient and reliable method of collaborative learning are some of its main contributions. The framework works well in terms of how long it takes for people to talk to each other. As the team continues to expand, it can also easily manage communication challenges and a widely differing event frequency range. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls
211,Testing of games through software agents managed by artificial neural networks,2020,"With the development of artificial neural networks, their use in different fields is increasing to optimize different activities. The availability of rich programming languages, various existing machine learning software libraries, along with the virtualization technologies has made intelligent technologies accessible not only to large corporations but also to individual programmers. Game development is a complex process involving many specialists, experts in various fields. Single-game testing is an iterative process that covers different game development opportunities, different player abilities, as well as player interaction when working in a team. The question is, is it possible to use intelligent software agents in the game testing process in order to optimize the human, time and financial resources needed? This article introduces our attempt to create an intelligent autonomous agent that plays the Brawl Stars game, managed by an artificial neural network. Initially, the agent is trained by collecting frames from a game that is being played by an experienced player. The frames are then processed and analyzed, and a neural network is trained, which directs the agent to conduct an autonomous game. The developed agent was used in two experiments that confirmed the great potential for the use of artificial neural networks in game testing.",,第4页.xls
212,Interface agents in complex systems,1996,"Most research on interface agents has focused on generic tasks such as electronic-mail management or electronic purchasing. Less research, particularly at a general or methodological level, has been devoted to interface agents for complex, domain-specific HCIs. It is argued that interface agent concepts and technology are most applicable to the class of complex domain-based HCIs. However, a major obstacle to development of interface agents in this class of systems is the fact that these applications are, by their very nature, highly complex, and closely tied to specific task domains. The paper describes research to create a workbench, based on the COGNET framework for user-modeling (Zachary et al., 1992). COGNET is a well-established and validated technique for user cognitive model. It focuses on complex problem domains in which the human system user must contend with: real-time problems that evolve and require solution in real-time, and multi-tasking: systems and missions that place multiple, often simultaneous demands on the operator's attention, domain expertise, acquired knowledge and experience in solving similar problems in the same domain. A COGNET-based Generator of Intelligent Agents (GINA) workbench is described, in which an agent-developer graphically creates a cognitive model of a user's taskwork strategy, and automatically translates the model into an executable user model within a interface agent `shell'. Specific functionality is then added to allow the agent to use the embedded user model to reason about and help the system user perform tasks, solve problems, and manage attention. Examples of GINA-based agent applications in complex system environments are given.",,第4页.xls
213,EFFECTIVE VISUAL SURVEILLANCE OF HUMAN CROWDS USING COOPERATIVE UNMANNED VEHICLES,2016,"The goal of this work is to propose an effective and efficient visual surveillance system for detection, geo-localization, and data association of moving human crowds using teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in a border patrol application. Such complex system suffers from various emerging challenges such as: heterogeneous dynamic data, non-rigid target shapes, dynamic background due to moving sensors, and occlusion. Therefore, different fidelity levels have been considered in this work for UAVs and UGVs based on their different characteristics, and a number of related computer vision algorithms have been proposed based on the dynamic data driven application system (DDDAS) paradigm. Moreover, a testbed involving real hardware (UAVs, UGVs, and cameras) and an agent-based simulation model is developed to verify, validate, and demonstrate the system. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for visual surveillance of human crowds by unmanned vehicles.",,第4页.xls
214,"RoboCup MSL - History, Accomplishments, Current Status and Challenges Ahead",2015,"The RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL) is one of the founding leagues of the annual RoboCup competition. Ever since its birth it has been a league where development of hard-and software happens simultaneously in a real-world decentralized multi-robot soccer setting. Over the years the MSL achieved scientific results in robust design of mechatronic systems, sensor-fusion, tracking, world modelling and distributed multi-agent coordination. Because of recent rule changes which actively stimulate passing, matches in RoboCup MSL have become increasingly appealing to a general audience. Approximately five thousand spectators were present during last years final match. In this paper we present our plan to build on this momentum to further boost scientific progress and to attract new teams to the league. We also give a historical overview and discuss the current state of the MSL competition in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.",,第4页.xls
215,Evaluation of the adherence to surgical antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations and associated factors in a University Hospital: A cross-sectional study,2024,"Background: Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) is an important preventive measure, aiming to minimize surgical site infections. However, despite evidence-based guidelines, adherence to SAP protocols remains suboptimal in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to assess the adequacy of SAP in a high-complexity hospital and investigate associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional design was conducted, involving surgeries performed by expert teams in cardiology, urology, neurology, and gastrointestinal. SAP prescriptions were evaluated based on indication, antibiotic choice, dosage, and duration, according to the hospital protocol. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and association tests between protocol adherence and patient demographics, clinical variables, surgical teams, and types of surgeries. Results: Out of 1,864 surgeries, only 20.7% adhered to SAP protocols. Lower adherence rates were observed for antibiotic choice and duration of prophylaxis. Neurological surgeries exhibited significantly lower adherence, particularly concerning antibiotic choice and duration. Factors associated with nonadherence included elevated preoperative blood glucose levels, prolonged hospitalization, and extended surgical duration. Logistic regression analysis identified surgical teams as significant factors influencing protocol adherence. Conclusions: Despite the relatively high adherence to antibiotic dosage, challenges persist in antibiotic choice and duration adjustment. Poor glycemic control, prolonged surgery, and surgical teams were variables associated with inappropriate practice. (c) 2024 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

216,Simulating A Disaster Social Solidarity in an Emergency,2016,"Due to the non-predictive nature of disasters, there is little first-hand data available which in turn is a serious constraint to conduct research on the implication of disasters on urban population. Computational sociology aims at by-passing this issue by simulating the situation that cannot be observed. This paper attempts to use agent-based simulation models to (i) examine the importance of Durkheim's notion of Social Solidarity on behavioral responses in an emergency situation [I], (ii) observe the intluence of this Social Solidarity notion in an emergency situation and (iii) validate the use of simulation in this case. Our team created therefore two simulation models representing two hypothetical scenarios, one where the population exhibits low social solidarity, while in the other the virtual entities show high social solidarity. Our findings conclude that low social solidarity leads to behavioral responses of panic and selfishness while high solidarity leads to an ordered and organized evacuation. With these findings, a theory of how a typical urban population would react to a large-scale disaster is formulated. The validity and effectiveness of agent-based modeling as an epistemological tool is also discussed.",,第4页.xls
217,Human-Agent Teaming for Effective Multirobot Management: Effects of Agent Transparency,2016,"The U.S. Army Research Laboratory is engaged in a multi-year program focusing on the human role in supervising autonomous vehicles. We discuss this research with regard to patterns of human/intelligent agent (IA) interrelationships, and explore the dynamics of these patterns in terms of supervising multiple autonomous vehicles. The first design pattern focuses on a human operator controlling multiple autonomous vehicles via a single IA. The second design pattern involves multiple intelligent systems including (a) human operator, (b) IA-asset manager, (c) IA-planning manager, (d) IA-mission monitor, and (e) multiple autonomous vehicles. Both scenarios require a single operator to control multiple heterogeneous autonomous vehicles, and yet the complexity of both the mission variables and the relations among the autonomous vehicles makes efficient operations by a single operator difficult at best. Key findings of two recent research programs are summarized with an emphasis on their implications for developing future systems with similar design patterns. Our conclusions stress the importance of operator situation awareness, not only of the immediate environment, but also of the IA's intent, reasoning and predicted outcomes.",,第4页.xls
218,"Evolving specialisation, altruism, and group-level optimisation using tags",2003,"We present a model that demonstrates the evolution of groups composed of cooperative individuals performing specialised functions. Specialisation and cooperation results from an evolutionary process in which selection and reproduction is based on individual fitness. Specialists come to help (through the donation of resources) their non-kin group members, optimising their behaviour as a team and producing a fitter group. The mechanism that promotes this benevolent, cooperative group behaviour is based on the concept of a tag. Tags(1) are observable markings, cues or displays. Individuals can observe the tags of others and take alternative actions based on those observations (e.g. to altruistically(2) help or not). We show that even random (or dumb) searching for appropriate partners produces significant levels. of specialisation and cooperation. Additionally we demonstrate that non-random (or smart) searching dramatically increases the effect.",,第4页.xls

We made our attempt to expose a base strategy from past log files and implement an online learning system which receives information from the environment. In developing the coach, the main research effort comprises two complementary parts: (a) Design a rule-based expert system in which its task is to analyze the game (b) Employing the decision-making trees for generating advice. Considering these two methods, coach learns to predict agent behavior and automatically generates advice to improve team's performance.

The model is realised in a tool that supports designers in this task. Given a list of materials currently proposed, similar alternatives are offered to individual designers based upon both shared and private representations. Fuzzy measures of similarity are used to identify possible counter proposals. A fuzzy measure of value is used to rank these. Conventional negotiation protocols from economics or game theory did not correspond well to the negotiation behaviour of designers. Currently, the human user remains responsible for the communication of any proposal he or she wishes to make, and for the supporting argumentation.",,第4页.xls

223,Agent-based systems co-operation,1999,"Information exchange between sites within network is currently based on automated data exchange at the protocol level and unfortunately only on supervised information exchange at the user level. Automation of information exchange is as difficult, as still no domain-independent general semantics can be defined. Users of small systems, as well as those of large interactive systems that are connected to the network, suffer from insufficient support for their information exchange. In order to overcome this semantics problem, we propose a framework in which users can incrementally define and store their knowledge about distributed data and information sources. For this purpose, we have developed the AgentTeam framework where this provides for network connectivity at the information level. It is designed to support the co-operative work of user teams, users, and network sites in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. AgentTeam simulates the user a distributed but homogeneous database environment. In this contribution, we introduce the architecture of AgentTeam and a sample prototype implementation. We discuss the prototype by showing how users can build their own views by composing their data from autonomous locally dispersed DBMSs.",,第4页.xls
224,Towards a Unifying Framework for Formal Theories of Novelty,2021,"Managing inputs that are novel, unknown, or out-of-distribution is critical as an agent moves from the lab to the open world. Novelty-related problems include being tolerant to novel perturbations of the normal input, detecting when the input includes novel items, and adapting to novel inputs. While significant research has been undertaken in these areas, a noticeable gap exists in the lack of a formalized definition of novelty that transcends problem domains. As a team of researchers spanning multiple research groups and different domains, we have seen, first hand, the difficulties that arise from ill-specified novelty problems, as well as inconsistent definitions and terminology. Therefore, we present the first unified framework for formal theories of novelty and use the framework to formally define a family of novelty types. Our framework can be applied across a wide range of domains, from symbolic AI to reinforcement learning, and beyond to open world image recognition. Thus, it can be used to help kick-start new research efforts and accelerate ongoing work on these important novelty-related problems.",,第4页.xls
225,Regret-Minimization Algorithms for Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning Systems [arXiv],2024,"A Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning (MACL) system is an artificial intelligence (AI) system where multiple learning agents work together to complete a common task. Recent empirical success of MACL systems in various domains (e.g. traffic control, cloud computing, robotics) has sparked active research into the design and analysis of MACL systems for sequential decision making problems. One important metric of the learning algorithm for decision making problems is its regret, i.e. the difference between the highest achievable reward and the actual reward that the algorithm gains. The design and development of a MACL system with low-regret learning algorithms can create huge economic values. In this thesis, I analyze MACL systems for different sequential decision making problems. Concretely, the Chapter 3 and 4 investigate the cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandit problems, with full-information or bandit feedback, in which multiple learning agents can exchange their information through a communication network and the agents can only observe the rewards of the actions they choose. Chapter 5 considers the communication-regret trade-off for online convex optimization in the distributed setting. Chapter 6 discusses how to form high-productive teams for agents based on their unknown but fixed types using adaptive incremental matchings. For the above problems, I present the regret lower bounds for feasible learning algorithms and provide the efficient algorithms to achieve this bound. The regret bounds I present in Chapter 3, 4 and 5 quantify how the regret depends on the connectivity of the communication network and the communication delay, thus giving useful guidance on design of the communication protocol in MACL systems",,第4页.xls
226,An actor-based simulation for studying UAV coordination,2003,"The effectiveness of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is being increased to reduce the cost and risk of a mission [Doherty et al. 2000]. Since the advent of small sized but high performance UAVs, the use of a group of UAVs for performing a joint mission is of major interest. However, the development of a UAV is expensive, and a small error in automatic control results in a crash. Therefore, it is useful to develop and verify the coordination behavior of UAVs through software simulation prior to real testing. We describe how an actor-based simulation platform supports distributed simulators, and present three cooperation strategies: self-interested UAVs, sharing-based cooperation, and team-based coordination. Our experimental results show how communication among UAVs improves the overall performance of a collection of UAVs on a joint mission.",,第4页.xls
227,Finding safe path and locations in disaster affected area using Swarm Intelligence,2016,"In this paper, a model - which uses Swarm Intelligence (SI) through the behavior of Ants is proposed. The model can be used to find safe paths to safe locations in such disaster-affected areas where the state rescue and relief teams may take some time to reach. The information generated (e.g., GPS logs at regular intervals) by stranded agents (victims), who have somehow managed on their own to reach safe locations, is used to find paths that can be suggested to other agents stranded in the disaster-affect areas. This is done through mobile-phones via web enabled services. The technique allows a large number of people to reach the safe locations on their own, which aids the ongoing state rescue and relief operations. Paths created by following the GPS log traces can be used to make new paths which are the hybrids of the previous paths created.

229,Visually guided cooperative robot actions based on information quality,2005,"In field environments it is not usually possible to provide robots in advance with valid geometric models of its environment and task element locations. The robot or robot teams need to create and use these models to locate critical task elements by performing appropriate sensor based actions. This paper presents a multi-agent algorithm for a manipulator guidance task based on cooperative visual feedback in an unknown environment. First, an information-based iterative algorithm to intelligently plan the robot's visual exploration strategy is used to enable it to efficiently build 3D models of its environment and task elements. The algorithm uses the measured scene information to find the next camera position based on expected new information content of that pose. This is achieved by utilizing a metric derived from Shannon's information theory to determine optimal sensing poses for the agent(s) mapping a highly unstructured environment. Second, after an appropriate environment model has been built, the quality of the information content in the model is used to determine the constraint-based optimum view for task execution. The algorithm is applicable for both an individual agent as well as multiple cooperating agents. Simulation and experimental demonstrations on a cooperative robot platform performing a two component insertion/mating task in the field show the effectiveness of this algorithm.",,第4页.xls
230,Biking with Particles: Junior Triathletes Learning About Drafting Through Exploring Agent-Based Models and Inventing New Tactics,2013,"The present research addresses a curious finding: how learning physical principles enhanced athletes biking performance but not their conceptual understanding. The study involves a model-based triathlon training program, Biking with Particles, concerning aerodynamics of biking in groups (drafting). A conceptual framework highlights several forms of access to understanding the system (micro, macro, mathematical, experiential) and bidirectional transitions among these forms, anchored at the common and experienced level, the macro-level. Training was conducted separately with two groups, both 14-17 years old youth: an elite junior triathletes team (experts; 4 male, 3 female) and a local team (hobbyists; 6 male, 3 female). The goal was to explore whether agent-based models of bikers and air particles could be used to enhance athletes understanding and performance, and whether this depends on expertise. The study lasted 3 days and included lectures, discussions, guided exploration of models, inventing new tactics, and biking in practice. Data included questionnaires, interviews, videotapes, and performance measures of heart-rate and biking duration. Athletes designs were innovative and diverse, expressing well-known and new features in the sport. Local features were more dominant than global features. Their performance in bicycle drafting increased dramatically, with a gain of 20 %, at both individual and group levels. The experts mainly reduced their times. Hobbyists mainly reduced their effort. Some conceptual change was evidenced for the complex systems components but not for drafting. Results are discussed in light of learning about complex systems and the balance between cognitive-verbal and motor learning within competitive sports.",,第4页.xls
231,Visual Captions: Augmenting Verbal Communication with On-the-fly Visuals,2023,"Video conferencing solutions like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams are becoming increasingly popular for facilitating conversations, and recent advancements such as live captioning help people better understand each other. We believe that the addition of visuals based on the context of conversations could further improve comprehension of complex or unfamiliar concepts. To explore the potential of such capabilities, we conducted a formative study through remote interviews (N=10) and crowdsourced a dataset of over 1500 sentence-visual pairs across a wide range of contexts. These insights informed Visual Captions, a real-time system that integrates with a video conferencing platform to enrich verbal communication. Visual Captions leverages a fine-tuned large language model to proactively suggest relevant visuals in open-vocabulary conversations. We present findings from a lab study (N=26) and an in-the-wild case study (N=10), demonstrating how Visual Captions can help improve communication through visual augmentation in various scenarios.",,第4页.xls

233,Learning obstacle avoidance behavior using multi-agent learning with fuzzy states,2004,"This paper presents a proposal of learning obstacle avoidance behavior in unknown environment. The robot learns this behavior through seeking to collide with possible obstacles. The field of view (FOV) of the robot sensors is partitioned into five neighboring portions, and each is associated with an agent that applies Q-Teaming with fuzzy states codified in distance notions. The five agents recommend actions independently and a mechanism of arbitration is employed to generate the final action. After hundreds of collision, the robot can achieve collision-free navigation with high successful ratio, through integrating the goal information and the learned obstacle avoidance behavior. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposal.",,第4页.xls
234,Modeling the LOGOS multi-agent system with CSP,2001,"The Lights Out Ground Operations System (LOGOS) system is a prototype multiagent system for automating satellite ground operations systems. It uses a community of software agents that work cooperatively to perform ground system operations normally done by human operators who are using traditional ground station software tools, such as orbit generators, schedulers and command sequence planners. During the implementation of LOGOS several errors occurred that involved race conditions. Due to the parallel nature of the asynchronous communications as well as the internal parallelism of the agents themselves, finding the race conditions using normal debugging techniques proved extremely difficult. Following the development of LOGOS, the development team decided to use formal methods to check for additional interagent race conditions and omissions using formal specification techniques. The specification revealed several omissions as well as race conditions. Our experience to date has shown that even at the level of requirements, formalization can help to highlight undesirable behavior and equally importantly can help to find errors of omission.",,第4页.xls
235,NINJA: A noninvasive framework for internal computer security hardening,2004,"Vulnerabilities are a growing problem in both the commercial and government sector. The latest vulnerability information compiled by CERT/CC, for the year ending Dec. 31, 2002 reported 4129 vulnerabilities representing a 100% increase over the 2001 [1] (the 2003 report has not been published at the time of this writing). It doesn't take long to realize that the growth rate of vulnerabilities greatly exceeds the rate at which the vulnerabilities can be fixed. It also doesn't take long to realize that our nation's networks are growing less secure at an accelerating rate. As organizations become aware of vulnerabilities they may initiate efforts to resolve them, but quickly realize that the size of the remediation project is greater than their current resources can handle. In addition, many IT tools that suggest solutions to the problems in reality only address some of the vulnerabilities leaving the organization unsecured and back to square one in searching for solutions. This paper proposes an auditing framework called NINJA (acronym for Network Investigation Notification Joint Architecture) for noninvasive daily scanning/auditing based on common security vulnerabilities that repeatedly occur in a network environment. This framework is used for performing regular audits in order to harden an organizations security infrastructure. The framework is based on the results obtained by the Network Security Assessment Team (NSAT) which emulates adversarial computer network operations for US Air Force organizations. Auditing is the most time consuming factor involved in securing an organization's network infrastructure. The framework discussed in this paper uses existing scripting technologies to maintain a security hardened system at a defined level of performance as specified by the computer security audit team. Mobile agents which were under development at the time of this writing are used at a minimum to improve the noninvasiveness of our scans. In general, noninvasive scans with an adequate framework performed on a daily basis reduce the amount of security work load as well as the timeliness in performing remediation, as verified by the NINJA framework. A vulnerability assessment/auditing architecture based on mobile agent technology is proposed and examined at the end of the article as an enhancement to the current NINJA architecture.",,第4页.xls
236,A Distributed Framework for Real Time Path Planning in Practical Multi-agent Systems,2017,"We present a framework for distributed, energy efficient, and real time implementable algorithms for path planning in multi-agent systems. The proposed framework is presented in the context of a motivating example of capture the flag which is an adversarial game played between two teams of autonomous agents called defenders and attackers. We start with the centralized formulation of the problem as a linear program because of its computational efficiency. Then we present an approximation framework in which each agent solves a local version of the centralized linear program by communicating with its neighbors only. The premise in this work is that for practical multi-agent systems, real time implementability of distributed algorithms is more crucial then global optimality. Thus, instead of verifying the proposed framework by performing offline simulations in MATLAB, we run extensive simulations in a robotic simulator V-REP, which includes a detailed dynamic model of quadrotors. Moreover, to create a realistic scenario, we allow a human operator to control the attacker quadrotor through a joystick in a single attacker setup. These simulations authenticate that the proposed framework is real time implementable and results in a performance that is comparable with the global optimal solution under the considered scenarios.

237,Mother ship and physical agents collaboration,1999,"This paper discusses ongoing research at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory that investigates the feasibility of developing a collaboration architecture between small physical agents and a mother ship. This includes the distribution of planning, perception, mobility, processing, and communications requirements between the mother ship and the agents.Small physical agents of the future will be virtually everywhere on the battlefield of the 21(st) century. A mother ship that is coupled to a team of small collaborating physical agents (conducting tasks such as Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA); logistics; sentry; and communications relay) will be used to build a completely effective and mission capable intelligent system.The mother ship must have long-range mobility to deploy the small, highly maneuverable agents that will operate in urban environments and more localized areas, and act as a logistics base for the smaller agents. The mother ship also establishes a robust communications network between the agents and is the primary information disseminating and receiving point to the external world. Because of its global knowledge and processing power, the mother ship does the high-level control and planning for the collaborative physical agents. This high level control and interaction between the mother ship and its agents (including inter agent collaboration) will be software agent architecture based. The mother ship incorporates multi-resolution battlefield visualization and analysis technology, which aids in mission planning and sensor fusion.",,第4页.xls
238,A test for believable social emotionality in virtual actors,2016,"An autonomous actor should decide on its own which goals and strategies to pursue in a new situation involving multiple actors. Humans in such cases typically rely on social factors, such as individual relationships and ethical background. An artificial autonomous agent in such cases can be more useful and efficient as an actor in a human team, if its behavior is believable, i.e., similar to the naturally motivated human behavior. This similarity can be achieved in a cognitive architecture through the attribution of characters to actors and human-like reasoning in terms of ethical norms and moral schemas applied to developing individual relationships among characters. Whether the actor's behavior is sufficiently human-like and human-compatible in this sense, can be judged based on a Turing-like test that is described and analyzed here in simplistic videogame settings. The challenge for an artificial actor is to be preferred, over its human rival, as a trustworthy partner of the human participant. Additional metrics include behavioral characteristics derived from the study of cognitive architecture eBICA. The paradigm extends to other settings as well, and can be useful for evaluation of cognitive architectures that support near-human-level social emotionality.",,第4页.xls

240,A CONVERSATIONAL EXPERT SYSTEM SUPPORTING BULLYING AND HARASSMENT POLICIES,2010,"In the UK, several laws and regulations exist to protect employees from harassment. Organisations operating in the UK create comprehensive and carefully-worded bullying and harassment policies and procedures to cover the key aspects of each regulation. In large organisations, such policies often result in a high support cost, including specialist training for the management team and human resources (HR) advisors. This paper presents a novel conversational expert system which supports bullying and harassment policies in large organisations. Information about the bullying and harassment policies and their application within organisations was acquired using knowledge engineering techniques. A knowledge tree is used to represent the knowledge intuitively, and a dynamic graphical user interface (GUI) is proposed to enable the knowledge to be traversed graphically. Adam is a conversational agent allowing users to type in questions in natural language at any point and receive a simple and direct answer. An independent evaluation of the system has given promising results.",,第4页.xls
241,Defining Generic Tasks to Guide UAVs in a MUM-T Aerial Combat Environment,2019,"In the fighter jet domain, it is very difficult to delegate tasks to unmanned systems because such a MUM-T scenario contains tasks from different dimensions, e.g. from AI, SEAD, OCA, etc. At the same time, there is a demand for a uniform and transparent operating concept, e.g. using a tactical map. Therefore, a way is looked for to describe the many different tasks with a uniform framework. In the presented approach a task command is split into an environmental object (physical, logical) to which the instruction refers. A military action to be performed on this object and a time parameterization (slacktime). The object specification corresponds to the classification as it is usual for vectorized GIS data (point, line, area). The military action results from the different types of use (AI, SEAD, etc.) and the domains of action (Intelligence, Effect, etc.).",,第4页.xls
242,Modeling of a Regional Hub Reception Center to Improve the Speed of an Urban Area Evacuation,2012,"The city of Chicago, Illinois is making strides to become more prepared for large-scale disasters. One idea is called a Regional Hub Reception Center (RHRC), which converts an existing facility into a temporary shelter for evacuees in the event of a 10-kiloton nuclear blast being detonated in the center of downtown. The RHRC will provide the evacuees with basic needs and register them for assignment at a more permanent shelter. The Regional Catastrophic Planning Team needs to know if its estimates for time, personnel, and resources are accurate. The best and most reliable way to test what will be needed is to perform simulations. However, large full-scale simulations are time consuming and expensive. A computer-generated model, however, can accurately simulate many variables and scenarios to test the RHRC quickly, cheaply, and repetitively to make it more effective if used. A computer modeling software tool, called AnyLogic, is a multi-paradigm modeling program that allows users to build agent-based, discrete event, and system dynamics models. The modeling paradigm that best suits the simulation of an RHRC is discrete event modeling. This is because a discrete event model represents a chronological sequence of events. When an event occurs in a discrete event model, it represents a change to the entire system. An RHRC is a chronological sequence of events and a system of systems that are constantly changing. As evacuees move through the RHRC, they flow through a predefined set of points, ranging from registration, to care, to shelter assignment, and many others. The data provided is supported by research or by personal field experience where research has not yet been performed. A model is a simulation of the real world. Though it does not represent the 100% of the variables that could occur in an actual simulation, it takes into consideration as many as possible to provide the most accurate results. The RHRC AnyLogic model is a simulation that estimates resource needs and processes of an RHRC. The RHRC model created to support this paper was developed using data collected by all students in Dr. J. Eric Dietz's Homeland Security Seminar graduate level class at Purdue University in the spring semester of 2012. The purpose of this study is to determine if the goals of the Regional Catastrophic Planning Team are attainable based upon the data collected.",,第4页.xls

244,Modeling social agents in BDO logic,2001,"In recent research of mental state in MAS, researchers try to add social mental state attributes into individual model, and to study the reasoning rule of social commit, dependence, and joint intention. BDI model is applied in the specification and verification of practice system successfully, such as dMARS. But, there are many shortcomings with respect to the research on BDI agent, such as the over-domination of the intention-centered methodology, inconvenience to the description of sociality in MAS, and the gap between theory and practice. This paper replaces intention by obligation, which is a social concept and more intuitive. Firstly, we review the research on mental state of agent, analyze the shortcomings of the intention-centered methodology, present the layered conceptual model of MAS: in individual layer, agents memory and process belief, desire, and intention; in social mental layer, agents contact with other agent by memory and process commit, and obligation. The mental state of social layer is related with individual layer of agents. Then we point out that belief, desire and obligation (BDO) should be regarded as primitive attributes to describe agent's mental state and various societal phenomenon. We develop BDO logic and its semantics, import reward, punish, commit and decommit, and give descriptions for such social concepts as team, organization, and organization intention. We also discuss the deductive relationship between obligation and other mental states. We regard BDO logic as an improvement of BDI logic presented by Rao and Georgeff, and as a more expressive framework for the description of social agents and societal concepts. At last, we give an example to show the description power of BDO logic. The future work include giving more perfect semantic model, proving the soundness and completeness of BDO logic, giving dynamic model of BDO agent by combining dynamic revise semantic of mental states, and presenting agent/MAS structure based on BDO logic frame.",,第4页.xls
245,"How Otto did not extend his mind, but might have: Dynamic systems theory and social-cultural group selection",2017,"Proponents of cognitive Situationism argue that the human mind is embodied, embedded in both natural and social-cultural environments and extended creating both extended and distributed cognition. Anti-situationists reject all or some of these claims. I argue that four major objections to extended cognition: (1) the mark of the cognitive, (2) the function-identity fallacy, (3) cognitive bloat, and (4) scientific irrelevance lose much of their sting in the case of distributed cognition, the extension of cognitive agency to a group of cognitive agents, such as a scientific research team. However, I claim that a crucial fifth challenge, that advocates of the extended mind commit the causal-constitution fallacy, has yet to be satisfactorily addressed. I focus on Spyridon Palermos' use of dynamic systems theory to refute this charge and I argue that his appeal to dynamic systems theory as a way of understanding system-constitution fails. Instead, I suggest a social-cultural group selection hypothesis for understanding system-constitution. But, I leave it for another day to elaborate that hypothesis' empirical plausibility.

246,CMPack: a complete software system for autonomous legged soccer robots,2001,"This paper describes a completely implemented, fully autonomous software system for soccer playing quadruped robots. The system includes real-time color vision, probabilistic localization, quadruped locomotion/motion, and a hierarchical behavior system. Each component was based on well tested algorithms and approaches from other domains. Our design exposed strengths and weaknesses in each component, and led to improvements and extensions that made them more capable in general, as well as better suited for our testing domain. Integrating the components revealed design assumptions that were violated. We describe the problems that arose and how we addressed them. The integrated system was then used at the annual RoboCup robotic soccer competition where we placed third, losing only a single game. We reflect on how our system addressed its goals and what was learned through implementation and testing on real robots.",,第4页.xls

Chatbots allow business to enhance customer experiences and fulfil expectations through real-time interactions in e-commerce environment. Therefore, factors influence consumer's trust in chatbots is critical. This study demonstrates a chatbots trust model to empirically investigate consumer's perception by questionnaire from self-reported approach and by electroencephalography (EEG) from neuroscience approach. This study starts from integrating three key elements of chatbots, in terms of machine communication quality aspect, human-computer interaction (HCI) aspect, and human use and gratification (U&G) aspects. Moreover, this study chooses EEG instrument to explore the relationship between trust and purchase intention in chatbots condition. We collect 204 questionnaires and invite 30 respondents to participate the survey. The results indicated that credibility, competence, anthropomorphism, social presence, and informativness have influence on consumer's trust in chatbots, in turn, have effect on purchase intention. Moreover, the findings show that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal gyrus are significantly associated with building a trust relationship by inferring chatbots to influence subsequent behaviour.",,第4页.xls
248,"Total Immersion: Designing for Affective Symbiosis in a Virtual Reality Game with Haptics, Biosensors, and Emotive Agents",2017,"Affective symbiosis for human-computer interaction refers to the dynamic relationship between the user and affective virtual agents. In order to facilitate a true, immersive experience, we believe that it is necessary to adapt the presentation of an affective agent to the user's affective state. Investigating the experience, behavior, and physiological correlates of affective events, such as winning and losing during a competitive game, therefore might be used to adapt the agent's emotional states and system events. An experimental virtual reality game environment was designed as a stepping stone toward a system to demonstrate affective symbiosis. Users were invited to play a game of air hockey with affective agents in virtual reality. We collected the electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, and postural data, as well as self-reports, to investigate how emotional events affected physiology, behavior, and experience. The users were found to be engaged in the competition strongly while only paying limited attention to their adversaries' emotional expressions. We discuss how game events are much stronger causes for affective responses, with the physiological effects of winning and losing becoming more enhanced as the game progresses. We discuss how an affective, symbiotic system could implement both game events and dynamic, affective agents to create a system for total immersion.",,第4页.xls
249,A distributed learning algorithm for particle systems,2009,"Particle systems, a type of swarm intelligence system, have repeatedly been shown to be capable of more general problem solving than just collective movements. The emerging, self-organizing behavior of such systems leads to collective behavior that tends to be far more complex than that of their parts, yet at the same time their self-organizing nature typically makes their behavior difficult to predict and control. In previous work, we introduced a set of mechanisms to guide the self-organizing process, allowing the system designer to exert a form of high-level control over a self-organizing system. Here we extend these past results by incorporating a pollen-based distributed learning algorithm that increases the capabilities of a team of cooperating agents in pursuit of a global goal, while still retaining most of the simplicity of particle systems. To demonstrate these ideas, we use a dynamic logistics problem that combines the coordination and cooperation issues of collective transport with the global optimization difficulties of routing and shop-floor scheduling problems. The results show that this form of dynamic distributed learning enables a particle system to function effectively and to adapt to changing conditions relatively quickly. Further, the results suggest that the combination of distributed learning with collective movements provides an additional advantage that significantly affects system-wide behavior.",,第4页.xls

This solution comprises hardware prototypes including sensors, micro-controllers and software agents that work together to make hospital environments more proactive. In addition, the proposed solution provides remote storage of patient data in cloud-based platforms, allowing for any authorized person, including external professionals to work collaboratively with the local team. A web system enables real-time visualization of patient's record as graphical charts through an intuitive interface.

251,"AGENT-HUMAN INTERACTIONS IN THE CONTINUOUS DOUBLE AUCTION, REDUX Using the OpEx Lab-in-a-Box to explore ZIP and GDX",2011,"In 2001, a team of researchers at IBM published a paper in I JCAI which reported on the first experiments that systematically studied the interactions of human traders and software-agent traders in electronic marketplaces running the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. IBM found that two software-agent strategies, known as GD an d ZIP, consistently outperformed human traders. IBM's results received international press coverage, probably because the CDA is the mechanism that is used in the main electronic trading systems that make up the global financial markets. In 2002, Tesauro & Bredin published details of an extension to GD, which they named GDX, for which they wrote: We suggest that this algorithm may offer the best performance of any published CDA bidding strategy. To the best of our knowledge, GDX has never been tested against human traders under experimental conditions. In this paper, we report on the first such test: we present detailed analysis of the results from our own replications of IBM's human vs. ZIP experiments and from our world-first experiments that test humans vs. GDX. Our overall findings are that, both when competing against ZIP in pure agent vs. agent experiments and when competing against human traders, GDX's performance is significantly better than the performance of ZIP.",,第4页.xls
252,Synchronous Reinforcement Learning-Based Control for Cognitive Autonomy,2020,"This monograph provides an exposition of recently developed reinforcement learning-based techniques for decision and control in human-engineered cognitive systems. The developed methods learn the solution to optimal control, zero-sum, non zero-sum, and graphical game problems completely online by using measured data along the system trajectories and have proved stability, optimality, and robustness. It is true that games have been shown to be important in robust control for disturbance rejection, and in coordinating activities among multiple agents in networked teams. We also consider cases with intermittent (an analogous to triggered control) instead of continuous learning and apply those techniques for optimal regulation and optimal tracking. We also introduce a bounded rational model to quantify the cognitive skills of a reinforcement learning agent. In order to do that, we leverage ideas from behavioral psychology to formulate differential games where the interacting learning agents have different intelligence skills, and we introduce an iterative method of optimal responses that determine the policy of an agent in adversarial environments. Finally, we present applications of reinforcement learning to motion planning and collaborative target tracking of bounded rational unmanned aerial vehicles.",,第4页.xls
253,"Heterogeneous system challenges in control, coordination, and communication. A case study with unmanned ground-aerial vehicles",2005,"Summary form only given. Heterogeneous system design, modeling and testing requires that concepts and ideas from the diverse disciplines of distributed artificial intelligence, multi agent systems and generalized system theory be brought together under a common framework. Multilayer, hybrid, open architectures need be designed to manage distributed objects, services and modules between system components and support overall system functionality. Issues that need to be addressed include, among others, individual component control, component coordination and communication, as well as overall system functionality in the presence of communication failures. The presentation considers the case of heterogeneous teams of unmanned ground-aerial robots operating in uncertain/hostile environments. It discusses aspects of distributed system architecture; it addresses fundamental control and communication problems and recommended solutions to distributed task allocation using unmanned ground-aerial vehicles; it examines asset recruitment with and without communication failures.

254,IQA-EVAL: Automatic Evaluation of Human-Model Interactive Question Answering,2024,"To evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA), traditional methods typically focus on directly assessing the immediate responses generated by the models based on the given question and context. In the common use case of humans seeking AI assistant's help in finding information, these non-interactive evaluations do not account for the dynamic nature of human-model conversations, and interaction-aware evaluations have shown that accurate QA models are preferred by humans (Lee et al., 2023). Recent works in human-computer interaction (HCI) have employed human evaluators to conduct interactions and evaluations, but they are often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to scale. In this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework IQA-EVAL to Interactive Question Answering Evaluation. More specifically, we introduce LLM-based Evaluation Agent (LEA) that can: (1) simulate human behaviors to generate interactions with IQA models; (2) automatically evaluate the generated interactions. Moreover, we propose assigning personas to LEAs to better simulate groups of real human evaluators. We show that: (1) our evaluation framework with GPT-4 (or Claude) as the backbone model achieves a high correlation with human evaluations on the IQA task; (2) assigning personas to LEA to better represent the crowd further significantly improves correlations. Finally, we use our automatic metric to evaluate five recent representative LLMs with over 1000 questions from complex and ambiguous question answering tasks, which comes with a substantial cost of $5k if evaluated by humans.",,第4页.xls
255,Comparing apples with oranges Evaluating twelve paradigms of agency,2007,"We report on a study in which twelve different paradigms were used to implement agents acting in an environment which borrows elements from artificial life and multi-player strategy games. In choosing the paradigms we strived to maintain a balance between high level, logic based approaches to low level, physics oriented models; between imperative programming, declarative approaches and learning from basics as well as between anthropomorphic or biologically inspired models on one hand and pragmatic, performance oriented approaches on the other.Instead of strictly numerical comparisons (which can be applied to certain pairs of paradigms, but might be meaningless for others), we had chosen to view each paradigm as a methodology, and compare the design, development and debugging process of implementing the agents in the given paradigm.We found that software engineering techniques could be easily applied to some approaches, while they appeared basically meaningless for other ones. The performance of some agents were easy to predict from the start of the development, for other ones, impossible. The effort required to achieve certain functionality varied widely between the different paradigms. Although far from providing a definitive verdict on the benefits of the different paradigms, our study provided a good insight into what type of conceptual, technical or organizational problems would a development team face depending on their choice of agent paradigm.",,第4页.xls
256,A Technological Solution to Provide Integrated and Process-Oriented Care Services in Healthcare Organizations,2016,"Integrated health services are characterized by a high degree of collaboration and communication among health professionals, as well as a merge of political, administrative, and technical actions, which can allow the sharing of information among healthcare team members (physicians, nurses, managers, and other stakeholders) related to patient care, and access to hospital infrastructure and technology, within a patient-centered approach. In this paper, we propose a technological solution based on software agents, which allows supporting the management of collaborative processes in environments of dynamic collaborative networks. We present a methodology for coordinating healthcare services through collaborative processes to enable organizations providing integrated care services and continuous process improvements. This methodology includes methods based on Model-Driven Development, which enable the generation of executable process models and the code of the process-oriented agents, derived from conceptual models of collaborative processes. The methodology andmethods are implemented and automated by software agents that enable the generation of the technological solution, at run-time on the platform. Furthermore, we propose an agent-based platform that enables organizations to negotiate collaboration agreements in electronic format to establish collaborative networks, as well as a definition of the collaborative processes to be executed. In this way, the proposed agent-based platform allows collaborations among heterogeneous and autonomous healthcare organizations focusing on the process-oriented integration, enabling us to provide integrated healthcare services.",,第4页.xls
257,Supporting the Commander's Information Requirements: Automated Support for Battle Drill Processes Using R-CAST,2011,"This paper discusses a novel approach that addresses the problem of supporting the Commander's dynamic information requirements through automation of the Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP) for time-constrained environments and training purposes, as part of the Tactical Human Integration of Networked Knowledge (THINK) Army Technology Objective - Research (ATO-R) initiative. We demonstrate this capability with automated user support for the execution of battle drills. Our approach is based on adapting the R-CAST cognitively-inspired agent architecture towards a context-aware anticipation of information requirements. R-CAST is a computational model of the Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) model, which models human decision making under time stress. R-CAST agents support and collaborate with human decision making teams as both smart aids and effective teammates by anticipating, investigating, seeking, and interpreting information relevant to decision making. A key feature of R-CAST is that the proactive sharing of information relevant to decision making is automatically generated by the computational RPD model. The fundamental research question being addressed is whether the inclusion of R-CAST in Army staff processes improves said staff understanding and execution of battle tasks. We adapted R-CAST to Battle Drill #26 (i.e., responding to an IED event) as a proof of concept for team decision making under stress and constant switching of modalities. We demonstrate that the use of R-CAST cognitive agents effectively assists the Battle Manager in the S3 cell with auto-filling certain forms required by doctrine in response to the dynamism of the current state of the environment, improving cognitive performance in this task.

258,Intermittent Communications in Decentralized Shadow Reward Actor-Critic,2021,"Broader decision-making goals such as risk-sensitivity, exploration, and incorporating prior experience motivates the study of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems where the objective is any nonlinear function of the team's long-term state-action occupancy measure, i.e., a general utility, which subsumes the aforementioned goals. Existing decentralized actor-critic algorithms to solve this problem require extensive message passing per policy update, which may be impractical. Thus, we put forth Communication-Efficient Decentralized Shadow Reward Actor-Critic (CE-DSAC) that may operate with time-varying or event-triggered network connectivities. This scheme operates by having agents to alternate between policy evaluation (critic), weighted averaging with neighbors (information mixing), and local gradient updates for their policy parameters (actor). CE-DSAC is different from the usual critic update in its local occupancy measure estimation step which is needed to estimate the derivative of the local utility with respect to their occupancy measure, i.e., the shadow reward, and the amount of local weighted averaging steps executed by agents. This scheme improves existing tradeoffs between communications and convergence: to obtain epsilon-stationarity, we require in O(1/epsilon(2.5)) (Theorem IV.6) or faster O(1/C-2) (Corollary IV.8) steps with high probability. Experiments demonstrate the merits of this approach for multiple RL agents solving cooperative navigation tasks with intermittent communications.",,第4页.xls
259,Gathering Despite Mischief,2014,"A team consisting of an unknown number of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, have to meet at the same node. Agents move in synchronous rounds. Each agent has a different label. Up to f of the agents are Byzantine. We consider two levels of Byzantine behavior. A strongly Byzantine agent can choose an arbitrary port when it moves and it can convey arbitrary information to other agents, while a weakly Byzantine agent can do the same, except changing its label. What is the minimum number of good agents that guarantees deterministic gathering of all of them, with termination? We solve exactly this Byzantine gathering problem in arbitrary networks for weakly Byzantine agents and give approximate solutions for strongly Byzantine agents, both when the size of the network is known and when it is unknown. It turns out that both the strength versus the weakness of Byzantine behavior and the knowledge of network size significantly impact the results.For weakly Byzantine agents, we show that any number of good agents permits solving the problem for networks of known size. If the size is unknown, then this minimum number is f + 2. More precisely, we show a deterministic polynomial algorithm that gathers all good agents in an arbitrary network, provided that there are at least f + 2 of them. We also provide a matching lower bound: we prove that if the number of good agents is at most f + 1, then they are not able to gather deterministically with termination in some networks.For strongly Byzantine agents, we give a lower bound of f + 1, even when the graph is known: we show that f good agents cannot gather deterministically in the presence of f Byzantine agents even in a ring of known size. On the positive side, we give deterministic gathering algorithms for at least 2 f + 1 good agents when the size of the network is known and for at least 4 f 2 good agents when it is unknown.",,第4页.xls
260,Keynote Speech 1: Top Technology Trends,2021,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is devoted to create intelligent software and hardware. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, numerous ICT technologies have been developed to enhance digital transformation and inclusion. The Internet of Behavior (IoB) is the art of using data to change behavior of users. Data is gathered, combined, and processed including customer data, social media, facial recognition, and location tracking. Advances in AI techniques paved the way to the emergence of Autonomic Systems which are self-managed systems that learn from their environments and dynamically modify their own algorithms -in real time -to optimize their behavior in complex ecosystems. In order to enable scalability, remote operations, and business model description, Hyper automation approach is used to rapidly identify and automate as many business and IT processes as possible using technologies of AI, machine learning, event-driven software architecture, and robotic process automation in addition to other tools and platforms. The next big thing was announced by Mark Zuckerberg on October 28th by changing the well-known Facebook to Meta and the outbreak of METAVERSE, a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and crypto currencies to allow users interact virtually.

261,Multi-agent architecture for information retrieval and intelligent monitoring by UAVs in known environments affected by catastrophes,2020,"The consequences of natural or man-made catastrophes can be devastating. To minimize its impact, it is crucial to carry out a rapid analysis of the affected environment in the moments after they occur, especially from the perspective of alert notification or crisis management. In this context, the use of UAVs, understood as the technological basis on which intelligent systems capable of providing support to rescue teams is built, has positively contributed to face this challenge. In this article the design of a multi-agent architecture which enables the deployment of systems made up of intelligent agents that can monitor environments affected by a catastrophe and provide support to human staff in the decision-making process is proposed. These environments, known in advance, are characterized through a set of points of interests that are critical from the point of view of aerial surveillance and monitoring. To conduct an intelligent information analysis, a formal model of normality analysis is employed, which makes possible the definition of surveillance components. These represent the knowledge bases of the agents responsible for monitoring environments. Likewise, the architecture envisages communication and cooperation mechanisms between the different agents, as the basis for fusing information to assess the overall level of risk of the monitored environment. A case study is presented in which the spread of toxic smoke in an industrial complex which has just suffered a hypothetical earthquake is monitored.",,第4页.xls
262,Brave New World of Artificial Intelligence: Its Use in Antimicrobial Stewardship-A Systematic Review,2024,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health problem in the One Health dimension. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging in healthcare, since it is helpful to deal with large amounts of data and as a prediction tool. This systematic review explores the use of AI in antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) and summarizes the predictive performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms, compared with clinical decisions, in inpatients and outpatients who need antimicrobial prescriptions. This review includes eighteen observational studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The exclusion criteria comprised studies conducted only in vitro, not addressing infectious diseases, or not referencing the use of AI models as predictors. Data such as study type, year of publication, number of patients, study objective, ML algorithms used, features, and predictors were extracted from the included publications. All studies concluded that ML algorithms were useful to assist antimicrobial stewardship teams in multiple tasks such as identifying inappropriate prescribing practices, choosing the appropriate antibiotic therapy, or predicting AMR. The most extracted performance metric was AUC, which ranged from 0.64 to 0.992. Despite the risks and ethical concerns that AI raises, it can play a positive and promising role in ASP.",,第4页.xls
263,Multi-agent simulations for the evaluation of Looting Systems design in MMOG and MOBA games,2018,"Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are persistent worlds where a huge number of players interact with each other in order to improve their avatar's characteristics. Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs) - also known as Action Real-Time Strategy (ARTS) games - are video games in which each player controls a single character in one of two competing teams; goal of the game is to destroy the antagonist team. In both genres, players' characters typically exploit their special abilities, which contribute to the overall strategy of their faction or team. Social interactions among players are at the core of both these game types, and a careful design of the game social architecture is a key factor in determining the success of a specific product.The attention of researchers and practitioners has, till now, focused mainly on several game features, while others have been considered secondary, possibly underestimating their importance in terms of the game overall quality. For instance, in MMOGs, loot items (a type of in-game reward) are not distributed evenly, and the competition for getting the best prize, often, is left in the hands of the players. To handle this issue, players have created resource allocation algorithms called Looting Systems (LS). Generally, the adoption of a specific LS is based on a gentlemen's agreement among the players, and the respect of its outcomes largely depends on mutual trust. Quite recently, ad hoc forms of LS have been introduced also into MOBAs.This topic has received moderate attention by the scientific community, anyway, we sustain that a LS could influence the players' behaviour and, if mismanaged, possibly the survival of the whole community of players in a game. Hence, detecting and tracking the hidden social effects of apparently minor features could become a critical factor in the development of games genres which heavily depend on the quality of social interactions among players. To tackle this issue, we present a simulative study - based on Agent-Based Model (ABM) techniques - of the effects of the adoption of different LSs on heterogeneous player bases. The final goal of our study is to provide several guidelines and hints about the design of LSs to game designers working on MMOs or MOBAs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls

265,Adaptive/Cognitive Resonance and the Architecture Issues of Cognitive Information Systems,2020,"The rapid change of world causes new challenges in the business environment and in operational areas of enterprises. Those challenges likely increase the chance for client satisfaction and other key factors meanwhile improve companies' efficiency. Enterprises are not able to answer these challenges easily in time, e.g. predicting the potential future as one of the key elements impacting the long-term success. The required skills are rarely available in one single person or team, and they are not affordable or not efficient. Therefore, one of the possible solutions is to leverage the capability of a Cognitive Information System via Human Computer Interaction trough cognitive resonance and Cognitive Infocommunication. The cognitive resonance is a process, a resonance that supports and enhances the outcome of the Human Computer Interaction at each step. That determinate the Cognitive Infocommunication is a channel and a tool to realize the cognitive resonance that ensure and improve the quality of Human Computer Interaction that support the sensed data extraction and the semantic understanding. The aim of the article is to describe the silicon agent and the human interaction in light of Cognitive Infocommunication, meanwhile to map the value of Cognitive Infocommunication via human computer interaction. The results of the mapping support a better understanding of the importance of cognitive infocommunication, meanwhile it helps to place it interdisciplinary into the Information Technology sciences.

266,Collaborative decision making framework for multi-agent system,2008,"Highly complex problems are usually solved by a team of experts and decision making that involves uncertain data is challenging for human decision makers. Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) is an important human activity and it has many practical applications in society, economy, management and engineering, etc. Researchers are faced with new challenges in research on theory and methods of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) with the rapid advent of internet and information technology. Also, the existing groupware do not have tools to effectively analyze and provide support for social facets of group work. One of the challenges in collaborative work is social decision making in a computer mediated environment. Trust is a basic feature of social situations and plays a critical role in problem solving. Social Trust models like Recommender system, Trust management for pervasive computing, are becoming invaluable part of distributed systems. In this paper we have proposed a multi-agent based collaborative decision making framework for distributed environment in which a group of agents collaborate for decision making based on social issues. The proposed framework is capable of making good decision based on social parameters.

267,Guidance of Agricultural Ground Robots Team with an Aerial Vehicle: A Cost-Effective Solution,2023,"Increasing the operational efficiency of agricultural machines is essential by the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based navigation, planning, and control algorithms to handle the increasing demand for food production without compromising sustainability. In this study, an end-to-end path planning algorithm (AgroRL) is proposed for aerial-ground robots team collaboration. In the proposed solution, while main operations in the field are handled by the ground vehicle, the aerial robot is responsible for re-planning a collisionfree trajectory for the ground robot when the robot faces an obstacle. Deep reinforcement learning is used for training the end-to-end policy for local re-planning of the aerial robot. The agent, informed by the global trajectory, generates local plans based on depth images. Variational autoencoders are also investigated for dimension reduction of the depth images in obstacle avoidance context to speed up deep reinforcement learning and alleviate the computational complexity of the policy network. The agriculture environment is developed in the Webots open-source robot simulator for training and testing purposes. The efficiency and efficacy of the end-to-end planner are evaluated over a number of cluttered field scenarios.

Because of the high flexibility and adaptability. the human-robot cooperation is expected to have a wide range of applications in uncertain environments, not only in future construction and manufacturing industries but also in service branches. A multi-agent control architecture gives an appropriate frame for the flexibility of the human-robot-team. Robots are considered as intelligent autonomous assistants of humans which can mutually interact on a symbolic level and a physical level. This interaction is achieved through the exchange of information between humans and robots, the interpretation of the transmitted information, the coordination of the activities and the cooperation between independent system components. Equipped with sensing modalities for the perception of the environment, the robot system KAMRO is introduced to demonstrate the principles of the cooperation among humans and robot agents.

269,Searching for a soulmate - Searching for tag-similar partners evolves and supports specialization in groups,2004,"In a previous paper [11 we presented simulation results that demonstrated the evolution of tag based groups composed of cooperative (in-group altruistic) individual agents performing specialised functions. We showed how teams of individual maximisers (who copy the behaviours of those who outperform them) come to form internally specialised and cooperative groups that efficiently exploit their environment. We have also demonstrated [1, 2, 3] that the efficiency of the specialisation process is highly dependent on the searching strategy employed by agents to locate in-group members with required skills. Specifically we showed that populations of agents with smart searching strategies outperformed populations of dumb (random) search strategies - even when the costs of smart searching were much higher. We hypothesised that in mixed populations smart strategies would out-evolve dumb ones. In this paper we test this hypothesis. Our results show that smart strategies do indeed outperform dumb strategies for significant periods of time but that dumb strategies persist also. The time series of individual runs show cycles of smart and dumb strategies in the population over generations. We argue that the study of such phenomena offers a possible minimal way towards understanding the evolution of institutional roles and internal specialisation - without positing actions that originate at the supra-individual level (though we do not discount such actions).",,第4页.xls

272,The helpful environment: Distributed agents and services which cooperate,2006,"Imagine a future environment where networks of agents - people, robots and software agents - interact with sophisticated sensor grids and environmental actuators to provide advice, protection and aid. The systems will be integral to clothing, communications devices, vehicles, transportation systems, buildings, and pervasive in the environment. Vehicles and buildings could assist both their occupants and those around them. Systems would adapt and respond to emergencies whether communication were possible or not. Where feasible, local help would be used, with appropriate calls on shared services facilitated whenever this is both possible and necessary. Through this framework requests for assistance could be validated and brokered to available and appropriate services in a highly distributed fashion. Services would be provided to individuals or communities through this network to add value and give all sorts of assistance beyond emergency response aspects. In emergency situations, the local infrastructure would be augmented by the facilities of the responder teams at any level from local police, ambulance and fire response, all the way up to international response. An emergency zone's own infrastructure could be augmented when necessary by laying down temporary low cost sensor grids and placing specialized devices and robotic responders into the disaster area. These would form the basis for a distributed, adaptable, and resilient helpful environment for every individual and organisation at personal, family, business, regional, national and international levels.",,第4页.xls
273,Efficacy of a multidisciplinary team for preventing hospital acquired invasive aspergillosis: A five years experience,2009,"Invasive hospital-acquired aspergillosis (IA) is responsible for lethal outbreaks. In 2002, an interdisciplinary team was created in the teaching hospital of Rouen in order to organize the surveillance of construction sites by the implementation of environmental measures of prevention. The aim of our study was to estimate the efficiency of these measures using an indirect indicator, reflecting the incidence of the cases of invasive nosocomial aspergillosis (AI): the consumption of antifungals. From the nominative prescriptions established, we studied the medical files about 210 patients to track down the number of IA cases in intensive care unit(ICUI) and in pediatric hematology-oncology units between 2002 and 2006. The incidence of the cases was put in parallel with the various periods of level 5-risk works during these five years. The relative risk of appearance of the disease was calculated. In pediatric haematology-oncology unit, 35 cases were diagnosed on 99 medical files which have been studied and in ICU 19 cases were classified on 93 studied files. The follow-tip of the incidence in both units stake in parallel with the periods of level 5-risk works does not show increase of the number of cases. The calculated relative risk indicates the same result: the level 5-risk works are not a factor facilitating the appearance of invasive aspergillosis cases. This study shows the importance of the environmental measures of prevention during the periods of works within services for risk. The coordination of the actors within an interdisciplinary cell seems thus essential for the prevention of AIN. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.",,第4页.xls

275,Agent-Based Assistance for Engineering Change Management: An Implementation Prototype,2009,"Computer-aided design organizations worry much about the management of the communication between the various multidisciplinary teams working on the same project The good management of this communication is very important for the success of the engineering change management process. Each discipline must approve or reject a change request according to its constraints and inform the other disciplines involved. Currently, the communication between the various disciplines is performed using messages. The approval or the rejection of a change request can be made only if human experts representing these disciplines meet and negotiate, which in turn can be very time consuming. Organizations thus, have a great need for a system which could automate the communication between experts and assist them in making sound engineering change decisions. Such a system could also help by reducing the time needed to verify an engineering change request therefore accelerating the production start-up and the time to market This paper proposes an agent-based system that can manage the engineering change requests efficiently. Actually, the proposed system checks if the engineering change request does not create any inconsistency with the constraints stemming from the various disciplines. It also assists experts in making decisions by proposing alternative solutions. Each discipline is represented by an expert agent When an inconsistency is discovered, a negotiation process among expert agents is launched.

277,A serious game based on a public goods experiment,2013,"It has been pointed that public goods games lack experimental research in topics such as the study of the interaction of groups versus the interaction of individuals and effects of social identity and decision framing. Furthermore, the number of computational frameworks proposed to date to deploy these type of experiments is reduced. In this context, we propose the INVITE computational framework to serve as a useful research tool. The motivation behind the proposed framework is therefore straightforward: to allow researchers to be able to configure without difficulty public goods experiments where they can test their hypothesis regarding the behaviour of individuals, simulate behaviour of automated artificial intelligence and study the interaction between virtual agents and real persons. The greatest advantage of the INVITE framework is that it provides a high level of flexibility in the configuration of game theoretical paradigms. It is possible to configure simple structures such as the 2-player prisoner's dilemma or stag hunt as well as some of the most complex forms of inter-group conflicts such as team games. Accordingly, this framework allows an effortless parametrization, assisted by a tailored configuration tool, of a myriad of public goods games. Moreover, the 3D video game configured in the framework places the players in an immersive and engaging virtual environment where real-life conditions can be replicated and some circumstances, difficult to reproduce in real-life, such as life-threatening situations, can also be simulated. Given its characteristics, the proposed framework aims to represent an important contribution to the study of behaviour of both virtual and human players in scenarios of social conflict.",,第4页.xls

Based on this feasibility analysis, an algorithm capable of generating trajectories online and in real time, for the phantom track generation problem, is developed. A rigorous treatment of the phantom track generation problem, which includes results on its accessibility, feasibility, local asymptotic straightening of trajectories, and a limited result on system controllability, is given.

Distributed interval estimation learning (DIEL) was previously found to be promising for learning appropriate referral choices, compared to greedy and Q-learning methods. This paper extends these results in several directions: First, learning methods with several multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms are compared along with greedy variants, each optimized individually. Second, DIEL's rapid performance gain in the early phase of learning proved equally convincing in the case of multi-hop referral, a condition not heretofore explored. Third, a robustness analysis across the learning algorithms, with an emphasis on capacity constraints and evolving networks (experts dropping out and new experts of unknown performance entering) shows rapid recovery. Fourth, the referral paradigm is successfully extended to teams of Stochastic Local Search (SLS) SAT solvers with different capabilities.",,第4页.xls

In each dimension, a concurrent tasking conceptual structure is abstracted which contains task decomposition, distributed problem solving, interaction and combination as well as an iterative three step (propose, evaluate, execute) PEE loop. To combine the dimensions, the overall problem can be solved by a mixed and distributed optimization solution philosophy which extends the distributed maximum principles to allow numerical, symbolic, human and computer-aided problem solving methods to be merged based on the price and cost negotiation.

281,An intelligent personal spider (agent) for dynamic Internet/intranet searching,1998,"As Internet services based on the World Wide Web become more popular, information overload has become a pressing research problem. Difficulties with search on the Internet will worsen as the amount of online information increases. A scalable approach to Internet search is critical to the success of Internet services and other current and future National Information Infrastructure (NII) applications. As part of the ongoing Illinois Digital Library Initiative project, this research proposes an intelligent personal spider (agent) approach to Internet searching. The approach, which is grounded on automatic textual analysis and general-purpose search algorithms, is expected to be an improvement over the current static and inefficient Internet searches. In this experiment, we implemented Internet personal spiders based on best first search and genetic algorithm techniques. These personal spiders can dynamically take a user's selected starting home pages and search for the most closely related home pages in the Web, based on the links and keyword indexing. A plain, static CGI/HTML-based interface was developed, followed by an enhancement of a graphical, dynamic Java-based interface. Preliminary evaluation results and two working prototypes (available for Web access) are presented. Although the examples and evaluations presented are mainly based on Internet applications, the applicability of the proposed techniques to the potentially more rewarding intranet applications should be obvious. In particular, we believe the proposed agent design can be used to locate organization-wide information, to gather new, time-critical organizational information, and to support team-building and communication in intranets.",,第4页.xls
282,Ground tools for autonomy in the 21st century,2000,"Ground tools for unmanned spacecraft are changing rapidly driven by twin innovations: advanced autonomy and ubiquitous networking. Critical issues are the delegation of low-level decision-making to software, the transparency and accountability of that software, mixed-initiative control, i.e., the ability of controllers to adjust portions of the software's activity without disturbing other portions, and the makeup and geographic distribution of the flight control team. These innovations will enable ground controllers to manage space-based resources much more efficiently and, in the case of science missions, give principal investigators an unprecedented level of direct control.This paper explores these ideas by describing the ground tools for the Remote Agent experiment aboard the Deep Space 1 spacecraft in May of 1999. The experiment demonstrated autonomous control capabilities including goal-oriented commanding, on-board planning, robust plan execution and model-based fault protection. We then speculate on the effect of these technologies on the future of spacecraft ground control.",,第4页.xls
283,Designing AI for Explainability and Verifiability: A Value Sensitive Design Approach to Avoid Artificial Stupidity in Autonomous Vehicles,2022,"One of the primary, if not most critical, difficulties in the design and implementation of autonomous systems is the black-boxed nature of the decision-making structures and logical pathways. How human values are embodied and actualised in situ may ultimately prove to be harmful if not outright recalcitrant. For this reason, the values of stakeholders become of particular significance given the risks posed by opaque structures of intelligent agents. This paper explores how decision matrix algorithms, via the belief-desire-intention model for autonomous vehicles, can be designed to minimize the risks of opaque architectures. Primarily through an explicit orientation towards designing for the values of explainability and verifiability. In doing so, this research adopts the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach as a principled framework for the incorporation of such values within design. VSD is recognized as a potential starting point that offers a systematic way for engineering teams to formally incorporate existing technical solutions within ethical design, while simultaneously remaining pliable to emerging issues and needs. It is concluded that the VSD methodology offers at least a strong enough foundation from which designers can begin to anticipate design needs and formulate salient design flows that can be adapted to the changing ethical landscapes required for utilisation in autonomous vehicles.",,第4页.xls

The aim of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of patients diagnosed with Ai-ILD in Latin-America. We conducted an ambispective multicenter cohort study in 25 centers of Argentina, Colombia, and Uruguay between January 2015 and April 2018. Participants were included in the study if they had diagnosis of Ai-ILD performed by a multidisciplinary team. Patients were classified into the following sub-groups: connective tissue disease associated ILD (ILD-CTD), interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), and positive antineutrophils cytoplasmatic antibodies associated ILD (ILD-ANCA). All images were reviewed by a blinded thoracic radiologist. Out of the 381 patients included during the study period, 282 (74%; 95% CI; 69.39-78.16) were women. Mean age was 58 years old (SD 16). Three-hundred and twenty-five (85.1%; 95% CI 81.39-88.5) patients were classified as ILD-CTD (rheumatoid arthritis 31%, systemic sclerosis 29%, dermatomyositis 15%). Thirty-six patients were classified as IPAF (9.5%; 95% CI 6.9-12.8), and 13 (3.5%; 95% CI 2-5.75) as ILD-ANCA. Fifty percent of patients (95% CI 45.12-55.43) had a mild decrease of the forced vital capacity at the time of diagnosis. The most common treatment strategy was the combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide (30.1%; 95% CI 25.32-35.34) followed by azathioprine (20,3%; 95% CI 16.32-25.14).

285,DISTRIBUTED ON-LINE MULTI-AGENT OPTIMIZATION UNDER UNCERTAINTY: BALANCING EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION,2011,"A significant body of work exists on effectively allowing multiple agents to coordinate to achieve a shared goal. In particular, a growing body of work in the Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) framework enables such coordination with different amounts of teamwork. Such algorithms can implicitly or explicitly trade-off improved solution quality with increased communication and computation requirements. However, the DCOP framework is limited to planning problems; DCOP agents must have complete and accurate knowledge about the reward function at plan time.We extend the DCOP framework, defining the Distributed Coordination of Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE) problem class to address real-world problems, such as ad-hoc wireless network optimization, via multiple novel algorithms. DCEE algorithms differ from DCOP algorithms in that they (1) are limited to a finite number of actions in a single trial, (2) attempt to maximize the on-line, rather than final, reward, (3) are unable to exhaustively explore all possible actions, and (4) may have knowledge about the distribution of rewards in the environment, but not the rewards themselves. Thus, a DCEE problem is not a type of planning problem, as DCEE algorithms must carefully balance and coordinate multiple agents' exploration and exploitation.Two classes of algorithms are introduced: static estimation algorithms perform simple calculations that allow agents to either stay or explore, and balanced exploration algorithms use knowledge about the distribution of the rewards and the time remaining in an experiment to decide whether to stay, explore, or (in some algorithms) backtrack to a previous location. These two classes of DCEE algorithms are compared in simulation and on physical robots in a complex mobile ad-hoc wireless network setting. Contrary to our expectations, we found that increasing teamwork in DCEE algorithms may lower team performance. In contrast, agents running DCOP algorithms improve their reward as teamwork increases. We term this previously unknown phenomenon the team uncertainty penalty, analyze it in both simulation and on robots, and present techniques to ameliorate the penalty.",,第4页.xls
286,Perceptual grouping and attention in a multi-agent world,1999,"For some time now, we have been building Soar agents that model the behavior of a military helicopter crew. The crew functions performed by the pilot and gunner are simulated in a single agent, which we will hereafter refer to as the pilot agent, or pilot for short. Teams of these pilots perform tactical operations in a synthetic battlespace inhabited by thousands of other agents. A synthetic battlespace is a high-resolution, distributed simulation environment, which models combat situations at the level of the individual entity, which can be a vehicle such as a tank, a truck, an airplane, or an individual soldier. The synthetic environment includes a model of terrain, weather, daylight, time of day, dust, smoke, and craters. Two perceptual problems arose when we deployed Soar-based pilots in this dynamic, highly populated, multiagent world. The first problem was perceptual overload. The pilot was unable to cope with a large number of entities in its field-of-view: it lacked a focus of attention. The second problem was that the outputs of the pilot's perceptual system did not provide the level of abstraction needed by its reasoning system. Percepts were resolved as individual agents, yet, some tasks require reasoning about and understanding groups of other. We addressed the latter issue by introducing perceptual grouping, whereby the pilot can perceive groups of agents as a coherent whole rather than as individuals. This provided the right level of detail to the reasoning system while also providing a way of focusing attention. Attention can still be oriented toward individuals, but groups are the primary focus.",,第4页.xls
287,"MAJIC: A Java application for controlling multiple, heterogeneous robotic agents",2008,"When teaching robotics, we have a number of constraints and desires to satisfy. We are limited by the time available to teach a class, so we need a robotic system that our students can get up to speed on quickly and easily. We are limited by robot availability, in the robots that are on hand, but also because manufacturers of inexpensive teaching robots tend to go bankrupt or change focus quickly, making it difficult to purchase new robots with the same interface as previous models. Thus, we desire an interface easily adaptable to new robots. Finally, we have recently become interested in teaching techniques for dealing with teams of possibly heterogeneous robots. All existing systems that we examined fall short in one or more of these areas, prompting our development of the The Multi-Agent Java Interface Controller (MAJIC). MAJIC was designed from the bottom up with modern software engineering principles. The interface is easy to use and learn, can be quickly adapted to new robots, and allows control of multiple robots simultaneously. This paper presents the design of this system, highlighting rapid development and clarity compared with other systems.",,第4页.xls
288,Integrated engineering design coordination,2005,"The importance and significance of effective engineering management within businesses is widely acknowledged. This article has outlined a new approach that focuses on operational design coordination to efficiently manage engineering design. Furthermore, the unification and integration of the key elements offers an approach that is product independent. An application of this approach to a computational analysis, performed at the concept design phase of turbine blades, resulted in agents collaborating effectively at an operational level of management and technical engineering. Agents worked in a coordinated fashion ensuring the right technical task was undertaken using the right information by the right engineer/designer agent while utilising the right resource at the right time. The reduction of approximately 63 per cent in the time taken to analyse a concept design suggests that operational coordination provides a means of improving the efficiency of engineering management. To reinforce this suggestion, further applications of the approach must be undertaken and evaluated. It is recognised that a useful application would be within a company involving engineers and designers rather than agents.",,第4页.xls

290,Exemestane in early breast cancer: a review.,2008,"The adjuvant treatment of women with endocrine-sensitive early breast cancer has been dominated for the last 40 years by tamoxifen. However, the side-effects associated with this therapy have prompted a search for safer and biochemically more selective endocrine agents and led to the development of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane. Promising results in advanced disease have paved the way for treating early breast cancer, and AIs are increasingly replacing tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting. Several large, randomized trials with AIs have been completed or are ongoing in women with early-stage breast cancer, documenting the significant impact that these drugs are making on the risk for recurrence of breast cancer. As a result, there is increasing and widespread use of AI therapy for the treatment of early-stage endocrine-responsive breast cancer. This review summarizes the data for exemestane in the adjuvant setting, showing that a switch to exemestane after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen therapy is associated with a statistically significant survival benefit and is regarded as being sensitive by international and national experts.",,第4页.xls

293,"Serious Games for Language Learning: How Much Game, How Much AI?",2005,"Modem computer games show potential not just for engaging and entertaining users, but also in promoting teaming. Game designers employ a range of techniques to promote long-term user engagement and motivation. These techniques are increasingly being employed in so-called serious games, games that have non-entertainment purposes such as education or training. Although such games share the goal of AIED of promoting deep learner engagement with subject matter, the techniques employed are very different. Can APED technologies complement and enhance serious game design techniques, or does good serious game design render AIED techniques superfluous? This paper explores these questions in the context of the Tactical Language Training System (TLTS), a program that supports rapid acquisition of foreign language and cultural skills. The TLTS combines game design principles and game development tools with learner modelling, pedagogical agents, and pedagogical dramas. Learners carry out missions in a simulated game world, interacting with non-player characters. A virtual aide assists the learners if they run into difficulties, and gives performance feedback in the context of preparatory exercises. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in controlling the behaviour of the non-player characters in the game; intelligent tutoring provides supplementary scaffolding.",,第4页.xls
294,Frontiers of Robotic Colonoscopy: A Comprehensive Review of Robotic Colonoscopes and Technologies,2020,"Flexible colonoscopy remains the prime mean of screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and the gold standard of all population-based screening pathways around the world. Almost 60% of CRC deaths could be prevented with screening. However, colonoscopy attendance rates are affected by discomfort, fear of pain and embarrassment or loss of control during the procedure. Moreover, the emergence and global thread of new communicable diseases might seriously affect the functioning of contemporary centres performing gastrointestinal endoscopy. Innovative solutions are needed: artificial intelligence (AI) and physical robotics will drastically contribute for the future of the healthcare services. The translation of robotic technologies from traditional surgery to minimally invasive endoscopic interventions is an emerging field, mainly challenged by the tough requirements for miniaturization. Pioneering approaches for robotic colonoscopy have been reported in the nineties, with the appearance of inchworm-like devices. Since then, robotic colonoscopes with assistive functionalities have become commercially available. Research prototypes promise enhanced accessibility and flexibility for future therapeutic interventions, even via autonomous or robotic-assisted agents, such as robotic capsules. Furthermore, the pairing of such endoscopic systems with AI-enabled image analysis and recognition methods promises enhanced diagnostic yield. By assembling a multidisciplinary team of engineers and endoscopists, the paper aims to provide a contemporary and highly-pictorial critical review for robotic colonoscopes, hence providing clinicians and researchers with a glimpse of the major changes and challenges that lie ahead.",,第4页.xls
295,Operational Collective Intelligence of Humans and Machines [arXiv],2024,"We explore the use of aggregative crowdsourced forecasting (ACF) as a mechanism to help operationalize ``collective intelligence'' of human-machine teams for coordinated actions. We adopt the definition for Collective Intelligence as: ``A property of groups that emerges from synergies among data-information-knowledge, software-hardware, and individuals (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities) that enables just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone.'' Collective Intelligence emerges from new ways of connecting humans and AI to enable decision-advantage, in part by creating and leveraging additional sources of information that might otherwise not be included. Aggregative crowdsourced forecasting (ACF) is a recent key advancement towards Collective Intelligence wherein predictions (X\% probability that Y will happen) and rationales (why I believe it is this probability that X will happen) are elicited independently from a diverse crowd, aggregated, and then used to inform higher-level decision-making. This research asks whether ACF, as a key way to enable Operational Collective Intelligence, could be brought to bear on operational scenarios (i.e., sequences of events with defined agents, components, and interactions) and decision-making, and considers whether such a capability could provide novel operational capabilities to enable new forms of decision-advantage.",,第4页.xls
296,Achieving distributed decision-making using BDI and Coo2for future Distributed Tactical Decision Aids,2016,"Decision-makers in the tactical environment are cognisant of its contested, complex, unknown and dynamic nature. Traditional tactical information gathering and processing methods and decision-making processes within the current tactical environment are becoming less effective and burdensome. New tactical fighter air platforms require high-quality situation awareness and more advanced decision-making methodologies in order to deliver decision superiority. In essence, new generations of tactical air platforms require a redesign of their tactical Decision Support System (DSS), orTactical Decision Aid (TDA). Furthermore, these new air platforms can no longer work in isolation, but are required to be part of a distributed team. Therefore not only do new techniques in distributed decision making need to be developed, but the concept of Distributed Tactical Deci-sion Aids (DisTDAs) needs to be experimented. The issue on how to implement Coordination and Cooperation (Coo2) within DisTDAs needs to be firstly addressed.The Future Integrated Mission System (FIMS) is a first-of-its-kind Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based future integrated mission system for new tactical air strike platforms. The next step is to make FIMS and its TDA distributed - this can be achieved by integrating the Agent Coordination and Cooperation Cognitive Model (AC3M).AC3M illustrates how to implement agent coordination and cooperation by means of a cognitive and Intelligent Multi-Agent System (I-MAS). The centerpiece of AC3M is the ability to successfully show the link between Coo2and how beneficial the link is for enhancing team automation. Analysing the model produces three remarkable results: firstly is the Stimulate-Orient-Decide-Act methodology and secondly is how the Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) framework, Coo2and Stimulate-Orient-Decide-Act (SODA) were linked and interconnected. The final result was the enhanced decision-making that utilised the benefits created from the annexation of the BDI framework, Coo2and SODA.",,第4页.xls

298,Bioengineering With Multi-Agent Systems: Detecting Gait Patterns in Cerebral Palsy Children,2009,"The analysis and mathematical statistical processing of data coming from movement analysis systems is a hard and complex task. Moreover it requires the joint efforts of quite different disciplines: physiotherapists, medical doctors, mathematicians, software engineers... Nowadays the output of movement analysis systems (like BTS or Vicon) is poorly interpreted by clinics who mostly fail to take all the conclusions that could be drawn of the huge amount of data at their disposal. Nevertheless there is no turning back to the old subjective diagnosis methods. This paper presents the design of a multiagent system that strives to coordinate the different research efforts of the clinics and computer engineers at the Movement Analysis Laboratory of the Nino Jesus Children Hospital in Madrid. The mentioned research team has already produced valuable medical results in the field of diagnosis and new treatments for cerebral palsy children. Now the well proved elements of the employed information system are being composed together in a more synergic whole that has fallen naturally on the side of the multiagent software paradigm. The integration of data pre-processing, patient selection, medical feedback, intelligent learning and meaningful diagnosis components is described here.",,第4页.xls
299,Multi-agent search with interim positive information,2007,"A problem of searching with multiple searchers and scouts is presented. Unlike most search problems that terminate as soon as the target is found, successful detection by scouts only improve on the current knowledge of the moving target's location, such that the searchers can more effectively find and service the target in the future. The team must correspondingly plan not only to maximize the probability of the searchers directly finding the target, but also give them the best chance of exploiting any new information from potential scout detections. It is shown that this need to plan for replanning can be addressed by equivalently solving a series of simpler detection search problems that always do terminate on detection. Optimal and heuristic solution methods for this searcher/scout problem are derived, such that the capabilities of all the sensing platforms in a search task are harnessed even when only a subset are capable of actually servicing the target.",,第4页.xls
300,Path planning for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using genetic algorithms,2009,"In the future, autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) need to work in teams to share information and coordinate activities. The private sector and government agencies have implemented UAVs for home-land security, reconnaissance, surveillance, data collection, urban planning, and geometrics engineering. Significant research is in progress to support the decision-making process for a Multi-Agent System (MAS) consisting of multiple UAVs. This paper investigates fundamental issues in path planning for multiple UAVs. MASs with multiple UAVs are typical distributed systems. We propose to use genetic algorithms to plan multiple paths for multiple UAVs. Simulation technologies have become important to the development of aerospace vehicles. In this research, we verify the proposed path planning approach using Matlab. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to plan multiple paths for UAVs successfully.",,第4页.xls
301,Human and Machine Intelligence Together Drive Drug Repurposing in Rare Diseases,2021,"Repurposing is an increasingly attractive method within the field of drug development for its efficiency at identifying new therapeutic opportunities among approved drugs at greatly reduced cost and time of more traditional methods. Repurposing has generated significant interest in the realm of rare disease treatment as an innovative strategy for finding ways to manage these complex conditions. The selection of which agents should be tested in which conditions is currently informed by both human and machine discovery, yet the appropriate balance between these approaches, including the role of artificial intelligence (AI), remains a significant topic of discussion in drug discovery for rare diseases and other conditions. Our drug repurposing team at Vanderbilt University Medical Center synergizes machine learning techniques like phenome-wide association study-a powerful regression method for generating hypotheses about new indications for an approved drug-with the knowledge and creativity of scientific, legal, and clinical domain experts. While our computational approaches generate drug repurposing hits with a high probability of success in a clinical trial, human knowledge remains essential for the hypothesis creation, interpretation, go-no go decisions with which machines continue to struggle. Here, we reflect on our experience synergizing AI and human knowledge toward realizable patient outcomes, providing case studies from our portfolio that inform how we balance human knowledge and machine intelligence for drug repurposing in rare disease.",,第4页.xls

Furthermore, manufacturing and cost considerations are seldom taken into account since these impose further burdens on design teams. Concurrent engineering provides one means of ensuring that products satisfy the specifications and constraints imposed by all participating agents in the product design life cycle. An alternative is to provide the designer with a system capable of holding total product model descriptions and equip it with a knowledge-based design for manufacturing/assembly (DFM/DFA) capability and optimisers for function/form analysis.

304,Computing and Predicting Winning Hands in the Trick-Taking Game of Klaverjas,2019,"This paper deals with the trick-taking game of Klaverjas, in which two teams of two players aim to gather as many high valued cards for their team as possible. We propose an efficient encoding to enumerate possible configurations of the game, such that subsequently alpha beta-search can be employed to effectively determine whether a given hand of cards is winning. To avoid having to apply the exact approach to all possible game configurations, we introduce a partitioning of hands into 981,541 equivalence classes. In addition, we devise a machine learning approach that, based on a combination of simple features is able to predict with high accuracy whether a hand is winning. This approach essentially mimics humans, who typically decide whether or not to play a dealt hand based on various simple counts of high ranking cards in their hand. By comparing the results of the exact algorithm and the machine learning approach we are able to characterize precisely which instances are difficult to solve for an algorithm, but easy to decide for a human. Results on almost one million game instances show that the exact approach typically solves a game within minutes, whereas a relatively small number of instances require up to several days, traversing a space of several billion game states. Interestingly, it is precisely those instances that are always correctly classified by the machine learning approach. This suggests that a hybrid approach combining both machine learning and exact search may be the solution to a perfect real-time artificial Klaverjas agent.",,第4页.xls
305,A dynamic overlapping coalition-based multiagent system for coordination of mobile teams,2011,"In this work, we focus on problems modeled as a set of activities to be scheduled and accomplished by mobile autonomous devices that communicate via a mobile ad hoc network. In such situations, the communication cost, computational efforts and environment uncertainty are key challenges. It is known that keeping information about activities globally known by devices can provide better schedules. However, there are some contexts - such as those where activities require startup based on location - where information restricted to neighborhood coalitions of devices can still produce satisfactory scheduling. The existing heuristics do not consider this approach. In this paper, we propose a multiagent system that coordinates the dynamic formation of overlapping coalitions and the scheduling of activities within them. Heuristics for calculating the size of coalitions, as well as for scheduling activities are proposed. The system is applied to solve the problem of area coverage in a simulated environment and the results show that satisfactory schedules are obtained with lower cost of communication and computation in comparison with the solution based on globally known information.",,第4页.xls

The authors employ a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to help the computer to choose the best move to play. The computer game is designed allowing two degrees of difficulty: Beginners and Advanced. The results of several experiments show the strategic properties of this game, the strength of the proposed method by making the computer play the game intelligently, and the potential of generalizing their approach to other similar games.",,第4页.xls
307,Decision-making in policy governed human-autonomous systems teams,2017,"Policies govern choices in the behavior of systems. They are applied to human behavior as well as to the behavior of autonomous systems but are defined differently in each case. Generally humans have the ability to interpret the intent behind the policies, to bring about their desired effects, even occasionally violating them when the need arises. In contrast, policies for automated systems fully define the prescribed behavior without ambiguity, conflicts or omissions. The increasing use of AI techniques and machine learning in autonomous systems such as drones promises to blur these boundaries and allows us to conceive in a similar way more flexible policies for the spectrum of human-autonomous systems collaborations. In coalition environments this spectrum extends across the boundaries of authority in pursuit of a common coalition goal and covers collaborations between human and autonomous systems alike. In social sciences, social exchange theory has been applied successfully to explain human behavior in a variety of contexts. It provides a framework linking the expected rewards, costs, satisfaction and commitment to explain and anticipate the choices that individuals make when confronted with various options. We discuss here how it can be used within coalition environments to explain joint decision making and to help formulate policies re-framing the concepts where appropriate. Social exchange theory is particularly attractive within this context as it provides a theory with measurable components that can be readily integrated in machine reasoning processes.",,第4页.xls
308,Assisting human decision making with intelligent technologies,2008,"The human decision making process has been characterized as relatively sequential, limited by cognitive processes, and influenced by previous experience. Under conditions associated with real-time decisions, humans call experience emotional intensity, information overload, and other stressors that often affect their choices. Decision making becomes more complex with distributed teams, collaboration across global boundaries, the speed of information refresh, and the quantity of information available through networked sources. Intelligent decision support systems attempt to address these issues and assist human decision making by developing systems that integrate capabilities from the human user and computational intelligence. This keynote address presents background and research directions needed to advance intelligent decision support systems, and proposes an architectural framework to guide design and evaluation.",,第4页.xls

310,Beyond traditional architecture for MDO applications: The Erlang VM and its potential,2020,"In order to scale for speed, technology often builds upon the earliest proven systems and architectures. As the context changes, from a civilian application domain to a military application domain, the priority of functional requirements can and often do change. The hardware, software, and language development environment set the foundation for the constraints and potential of a system. This along with the fact the information technology revolution, since early 2000, has primarily been driven by the commercial sector, requires engineers to consider whether nontraditional, less well-known architectures may have a role in the Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) application space. This paper will highlight features inherent to traditional architectures, the challenges associated with these architectural features, and how the Erlang VM represents an opportunity to develop an architectural foundation suitable to the MDO application domain. Finally, this paper will highlight a future technology concept integrating demonstrated neural interface technology with an Erlang VM supported architecture. This foundation will help enable human-machine teaming by empowering a human agent to interact with sensors and AI-enabled autonomous systems with a dynamic user interface allowing the human agent to accomplish MDO applications. The great potential for the concept depends on a fault-tolerant, distributed system permitted by the Erlang VM to flexibly integrate the capabilities required to address the diverse challenges of a complex operating environment.",,第4页.xls

Multi-agent systems not only speed-up complex tasks, but also increase robustness and eliminate single-point failures. A search and rescue algorithm is being designed by using a team of collaborative autonomous robots to search an area for a stationary or mobile target.

312,Classifying ambiguous identities in hidden-role Stochastic games with multi-agent reinforcement learning,2023,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a prevalent learning paradigm for solving stochastic games. In most MARL studies, agents in a game are defined as teammates or enemies beforehand, and the relationships among the agents (i.e., their identities) remain fixed throughout the game. However, in real-world problems, the agent relationships are commonly unknown in advance or dynamically changing. Many multi-party interactions start off by asking: who is on my team? This question arises whether it is the first day at the stock exchange or the kindergarten. Therefore, training policies for such situations in the face of imperfect information and ambiguous identities is an important problem that needs to be addressed. In this work, we develop a novel identity detection reinforcement learning (IDRL) framework that allows an agent to dynamically infer the identities of nearby agents and select an appropriate policy to accomplish the task. In the IDRL framework, a relation network is constructed to deduce the identities of other agents by observing the behaviors of the agents. A danger network is optimized to estimate the risk of false-positive identifications. Beyond that, we propose an intrinsic reward that balances the need to maximize external rewards and accurate identification. After identifying the cooperation-competition pattern among the agents, IDRL applies one of the off-the-shelf MARL methods to learn the policy. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on Red-10 card shedding game, and the results show that IDRL achieves superior performance over other state-of-the-art MARL methods. Impressively, the relation network has the par performance to identify the identities of agents with top human players; the danger network reasonably avoids the risk of imperfect identification. The code to reproduce all the reported results is available online at https://github.com/MR-BENjie/IDRL.",,第4页.xls
313,A Layered Metric Definition and Evaluation Framework for Multirobot Systems,2009,"In order to accomplish it successfully, the top-level goal of a multi-robot, team should be decomposed into a sequence of sub-goals and proper sequences of actions for achieving these subgoals should be selected and refined through execution. Selecting the proper actions at. any given time requires the ability to evaluate, the current, state of the environment, which can be achieved by using metrics that give quantitative information about the environment. Defining appropriate metrics is already a. challenging problem; however, it; is even harder to assess the performance of individual metrics. This work proposes a layered evaluation scheme for robot Soccer where the environment is represented ill different time resolutions at each layer. A set, of metrics defined on chose layers together with a novel metric validation method for assessing the performance of the defined metrics are proposed.",,第4页.xls
314,Human perception and prediction of robot swarm motion,2019,"Great strides have been made in designing autonomous swarms of robotic agents, but there is a performance gap in complex situations and rapidly changing circumstances that human-agent teaming can fill. To design swarm control algorithms that are intuitive for human teammates to learn and use, it is necessary to understand how humans perceive groups of objects and predict group motion. To that end, we presented participants with groups of triangles as schematic representations of robot swarms and asked participants to predict where the center of the moving swarm would be in the future.We previously found that judgements of static swarm centers were biased by the direction of the apparent swarm heading, being attracted to the heading point when it was inside the group and repelled by it when it was outside of the group. Here we show that predictions of the center of moving swarms' positions were influenced by both the type of motion of the swarm and the control algorithm between individual robot members, with more accurate temporal and spatial responses when swarm movement was sinusoidal rather than parabolic and when the all robot members moved as one unit, rather than following a leader robot.These findings have implications for the design of swarm control systems, giving guidance on what biases to account for when designing the most intuitive controls. Also, there are theoretical implications for ensemble perception in psychology, as it runs counter to the prevailing theory that mean position judgements and mean motion judgements are mentally computed easily and without bias.",,第4页.xls
315,Methodology for Analyzing the Compromise of a Deployed Tactical Network,2011,"As the Department of Defense transitions to a ubiquitous computing environment, our military operations become increasingly vulnerable to compromise via cyber attacks at echelons as low as the Brigade Combat Team (BCT). There is a need to design a system to facilitate the analysis of a nation state's ability to compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of a deployed tactical network. Research demonstrated that, on these networks, compromises due to security protocols violated by humans are much more common than compromises due to technological vulnerabilities. Therefore, this analysis focuses on developing a simulation modeling approach to analyze the effectiveness of security protocols within the fortress and to track the damage done by various forms of cyber attacks that have successfully breached the network perimeter. Our network model uses agent-based simulation in order to model the flow of information at the packet level with dictated behavior specific to the agents modeled: individual network packets, computer systems, routers, servers, and files. The advantage to using an agent-based, rather than a discrete-event, simulation model in this situation is that agent-based models focus on the relationship between entities from the bottom-up, such as at the network packet level, rather than the entire system from the top-down. The developed simulation model allows us to simulate various network attacks, observe their interaction with network security protocols, assess the resulting damage in terms of the network's availability, and quantify the damage in terms of sensitive information lost.",,第4页.xls
316,Formal analysis of a space-craft controller using SPIN,2001,"This paper documents an application of the finite state model checker SPIN to formally analyze a multithreaded plan execution module, The plan execution module is one component of NASA's New Millennium Remote Agent, an artificial intelligence-based space-craft control system architecture which launched in October of 1998 as part of the DEEP SPACE 1 mission. The bottom layer of the plan execution module architecture is a domain specific language, named ESL (Executive Support Language), implemented as an extension to multithreaded COMMON LISP. ESL supports the construction of reactive control mechanisms for autonomous robots and space-craft, For this case study, we translated the ESL services for managing interacting parallel goal-and-event driven processes into the PROMELA input language of SPIN, A total of five previously undiscovered concurrency errors were identified within the implementation of ESL. According to the Remote Agent programming team, the effort has had a major impact, locating errors that would not have been located otherwise and, in one case, identifying a major design flaw. In fact, in a different part of the system, a concurrency bug identical to one discovered by this study escaped testing and caused a deadlock during an in-flight experiment 96 million kilometers from earth. The work additionally motivated the introduction of procedural abstraction in terms of inline procedures into SPIN.",,第4页.xls
317,A layered approach to learning intelligent behaviours in rescue robot simulation system using fuzzy logic and neural networks,2004,"RoboCup Rescue Simulation System is a particularly challenging domain for studying multi agent systems and multi agent learning. Machine learning has become a key solution to complicated multi agent tasks. In this paper, using machine learning as a tool for arriving at intelligent and efficient behaviors for Rescue robots involves layering increasingly complex learned behaviors. We describe multiple levels of learned behaviors. First the robots try to team basic knowledge about their environment's characteristics like the spreading speed of fire in the city after earthquake, or their ability to extinguish fires in different situations. ANN has been used to achieve these goals. Afterwards, using these learned components, they learn low level skills for fire extinguishment. Finally, in the next level they exploit fuzzy logic for planning their high level strategy toward their goal.",,第4页.xls
318,Empirical Evaluation of Similarity Coefficients for Multiagent Fault Localization,2017,"Detecting and diagnosing unwanted behavior in multiagent systems (MASs) are crucial to ascertain correct operation of agents. Current techniques assume a priori knowledge to identify unexpected behavior. However, generation of MAS models is both error-prone and time-consuming, as it exponentially increases with the number of agents and their interactions. In this paper, we describe a light-weight, automatic debugging-based technique, coined extended spectrum-based fault localization for MAS (ESFL-MAS), that shortens the diagnostic process, while only relying on minimal information about the system. ESFL- MAS uses a heuristic that quantifies the suspiciousness of an agent to be faulty. Different heuristics may have a different impact on the diagnostic quality of ESFL- MAS. Our experimental evaluation shows that 10 out of 42 heuristics (namely accuracy, coverage, Jaccard, Laplace, least contradiction, Ochiai, Rogers and Tanimoto, simple-matching, Sorensen-dice, and support) yield the best diagnostic accuracy (96.26% on average) in the context of the MAS used in our experiments.",,第4页.xls
319,Multi-agent Cooperative Cleaning of Expanding Domains,2011,"Several recent works considered multi-a(ge)nt robotics in static environments. In this work we examine ways of operating in dynamic environments, where changes take place independently of the agents' activity. The work focuses on a dynamic variant of the cooperative cleaners problem, a problem that requires several simple agents to clean a connected region of dirty pixels in Z(2). A number of simple agents move in this dirty region, each having the ability to clean the place it is located in. Their goal is to jointly clean the given dirty region. The dynamic variant of the problem involves a deterministic expansion of dirt in the environment, simulating spreading of contamination or fire. Theoretical lower bounds for the problem are presented, as well as various impossibility results. A cleaning protocol for the problem is presented, and a wealth of experimental results testing its performance in comparison to the lower bounds. Several analytic upper bounds for the proposed protocol are also presented, accompanied with appropriate experimental results.",,第4页.xls
320,Adrenal insufficiency in high-risk surgical ICU patients,2001,"Study objectives: To examine the incidence and response to treatment of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in high-risk postoperative patients.Design: Prospective observational case series.Setting: Large urban tertiary-care surgical ICU (SICU).Participants: Adults > 55 years of age who required vasopressor therapy after adequate volume resuscitation in the immediate postoperative period. Interventions: Each patient underwent a cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test; at the discretion of the clinical team, some patients were empirically given hydrocortisone (100 mg IV q8h for three doses) before serum cortisol values became available.Measurements: Adrenal dysfunction (AD), defined as serum cortisol < 20 g/dL at all time points, with Delta cortisol (60 min post-ACTH minus baseline) of less than or equal to 9 mug/dL; functional hypoadrenalism (FH), defined as serum cortisol < 30 g/dL at all time points or Delta cortisol (60 min post-ACTH minus baseline) less than or equal to 9 mug/dL; and AI, as the presence of either AD or FH.Results: One hundred four patients were enrolled with a mean age (SD) of 65.2 +/- 16.9 years. AI (AD plus FH) was found in 34 of 104 patients (32.7%): AD was found in 9 patients (8.7%), FH in 25 patients (24%), and normal adrenal function in 70 patients (67.3%). The absolute eosinophil count was significantly higher in the combined AD and FH groups compared with the group with normal adrenal function (p < 0.05). Forty-six of 104 patients (44.2%) received hydrocortisone; 29 (63%) could be weaned from treatment with vasopressors within 24 h. This beneficial effect of hydrocortisone reached statistical significance in the FH group when compared with untreated patients (p < 0.031); a similar trend was seen in the AD group (p = 0.083). Mortality was also lower in the hydrocortisone-treated AI patients (5 of 23 [21%] vs 5 of 11 [45%] in those not receiving hydrocortisone; p < 0.01).Conclusion: There is a high incidence of AI among SICU patients 55 years of age with postoperative hypotension requiring vasopressors. There is also a significant association between hydrocortisone replacement therapy, resolution of vasopressor requirements, and improved survival.",,第4页.xls
321,An Optimal State Dependent Haptic Guidance Controller Via a Hard Rein,2013,"The aim of this paper is to improve the optimality and accuracy of techniques to guide a human in limited visibility and auditory conditions such as in fire-fighting in warehouses or similar environments. At present, breathing apparatus (BA) wearing fire-fighters move in teams following walls. Due to limited visibility and high noise in the oxygen masks, they predominantly depend on haptic communication through reins. An intelligent agent (man/machine) with full environment perceptual capabilities is an alternative to enhance navigation in such unfavorable environments, just like a dog guiding a blind person. This paper proposes an optimal state-dependent control policy to guide a follower with limited environmental perception, by an intelligent and environmentally perceptive agent. Based on experimental systems identification and numerical simulations on human demonstrations from eight pairs of participants, we show that the guiding agent and the follower experience learning for a optimal stable state-dependent novel 3rd and 2nd order auto regressive predictive and reactive control policies respectively. Our findings provide a novel theoretical basis to design advanced human-robot interaction algorithms in a variety of cases that require the assistance of a robot to perceive the environment by a human counterpart.",,第4页.xls
322,Multiagent mission specification and execution,1997,"Specifying a reactive behavioral configuration for use by a multiagent team requires both a careful choice of the behavior set and the creation of a temporal chain of behaviors which executes the mission. This difficult task is simplified by applying an object-oriented approach to the design of the mission using a construction called an assemblage and a methodology called temporal sequencing. Assemblages consist of groups of basic behaviors and coordination mechanisms that allow the group to be treated as a new coherent behavior. Temporal sequencing partitions the mission into discrete operating states with perceptual triggers causing transitions between those states. Several smaller independent configurations (assemblages) can then be created which each implement one state. The societal agent theory is presented as a basis for constructions of this form. The configuration description language (CDL) is developed to capture the recursive composition of configurations in an architecture and robot independent fashion. The MissionLab system, an implementation based on CDL, supports the graphical construction of configurations using a visual editor. Various multiagent missions are demonstrated in simulation and on our Denning robots using these tools.",,第4页.xls
323,Aromatase inhibitors in the early adjuvant setting - the latest evidence,2006,"In early breast cancer, adjuvant therapy significantly reduces the risk of recurrence after complete surgical resection of the tumor mass. For over a decade, 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy with the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen has been the gold standard in hormone-receptor-positive (HR+) disease. Despite therapy with tamoxifen, relapses still occur, and the rate of relapse is particularly high in the first 2-3 years after surgery. More effective therapies are urgently required to prevent these relapses, particularly in patients with higher-risk disease. The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs), letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane, have shown greater efficacy than tamoxifen, with comparable tolerability, in large, randomized, phase III trials in the early adjuvant setting. On the basis of these findings, AIs are now displacing tamoxifen as the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy for HR+ early breast cancer in postmenopausal women.Two treatment strategies have been used to investigate AI efficacy in the early adjuvant setting, both with 5 years' tamoxifen as the comparator: upfront AI for 5 years, or switching to an AI after completing between 2 and 3 years of tamoxifen. When given upfront, anastrozole (ATAC trial) and letrozole (BIG 1-98 trial) have been shown to significantly improve disease-free survival compared with tamoxifen. Letrozole also significantly reduced the risk of distant recurrence, a well-recognized predictor of breast cancer death. Indirect comparisons suggest that these two AIs may not be clinically equivalent, but a direct comparison of letrozole and anastrozole in a prospective, randomized trial is required to prove whether these two AIs do differ clinically.Switching to exemestane or anastrozole therapy after 2-3 years of tamoxifen has also been shown to significantly reduce the risk of relapse compared with 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. However, in these trials, randomization and/or analyses were initiated at the time of switching therapy, including only patients who remained disease-free at this time, thus excluding patients with higher-risk disease who had experienced early relapse, and selecting a more favorable patient population. Trials comparing upfront AIs with the sequential approaches are ongoing: BIG 1-98 and amended TEAM. Of note BIG 1-98 is the only trial to include both switching strategies: tamoxifen followed by letrozole and letrozole followed by tamoxifen.Trials in the early adjuvant setting have revealed that AIs are generally well tolerated: side effects are predictable and manageable. Although further studies are required to determine the optimum treatment strategy and duration of AI therapy, the third-generation AIs are proving highly effective agents in the treatment of HR+ early breast cancer, and bring into question the validity of tamoxifen as the gold standard for adjuvant therapy. Recently updated international guidelines now recommend that early adjuvant therapy should include an AI. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls
324,Organizational adaptation,1997,"A computational model of organizational adaptation in which change occurs at both the strategic and the operational level is presented. In this model, simulated annealing is used to alter the organization's structure even as the agents within the organization learn. Using this model a virtual experiment is run to generate hypotheses which can be tested in multiple venues. The results suggest that, although it may not be possible for organizations of complex adaptive agents to locate the optimal form, they can improve their performance by altering their structure. Moreover, organizations that most successfully adapt over time come to be larger, less dense, with fewer isolated agents, and fewer overlooked decision factors. These results have implications for organizations of both humans and nonhumans. For example, they suggest that organizational learning resides not just in the minds of the personnel within the organization, but in the connections among personnel, and among personnel and tasks. These results suggest that collections of nonhumans may come to seem more intelligent (i.e., show improved performance) even if the agents remain unchanged if the system simply develops duplicate copies of some of the artificial agents and if the connections among agents are dynamically altered.",,第4页.xls
325,"An integrated system, with natural language management, for the monitoring activities in e-learning environments",2008,"The paper wants to describe and to show an integrated system made up of an artificial agent for the management of the natural language, with a basical knowledge written in the AIML language (ChatBot), with a PABX (Private Automatic Branch eXchange) software for the VoIP phone management and a Server's controlling daemon. This system has been conceived like a support for the management of web sections and in particular of web-learning (w-learning) platforms. The purpose is that of watching the platforms activity everytime, to be able to warn immediatly the teaching team in case of direct necessity with the learning community's users concerning the supplying of the learning contents and to warn the technical area in case of failures in the server system that contains the w-learning platform. The three components that complete the system have a specific operative aim: the artificial agent takes directly the role of front end on the w-learning platform, interacting in the natural language with the users of the learning community and in case of necessity it activates the PABX to send a direct short message (SMS) to the teaching team, containing the problem's object asked from the user to the agent; the controlling, daemon watches the server activities where the platform is installed, checking the efficiency of the services that are important for the correct operation of the w-learning (WEB Server, Streaming Server, Mail Server, etc...) system; in case of failures it makes use of the PABX too to forward a direct calling, depending on the kind of problem, to the person specialized in the system's operative maintenance; in other words, the PABX manages the VoIP connection, solving the requirements of the others' monitoring system's components, forwarding the callings efficiently in accordance with the defined and planned policy. In this way, this kind of system guarantees the monitoring operation everytime, both on the teaching activity and on the right w-learning platform's technical operation.",,第4页.xls
326,Cyber-I: Vision of the Individual's Counterpart on Cyberspace,2009,"Cyber-Individual, with a short term 'Cyber-I', is a real individual's counterpart in cyberspace. It is closely related to human-centric computing ideology which focuses on placing human in the center of computing. The study on Cyber-I tries to re-examine and analyze human essence in the digital era. Cyber-I's vision is to create a unique, digital, comprehensive description for every real person being in the cyberspace. Human's social context, mood, temper, physical status and so on also need to be considered for such a full description. Further research on social computing, antropology, human behaviour study, psycology and other fields/disciplines are required to enrich Cyber-I concept, meanwhile, Cyber-I will also raise new problems to these fields/disciplines. The IT technologies on the whole including ubiquitous computing, pervasive sensors, wired/wireless networks and clouds will bring Cyber-I vision into practice. In this paper, we first present the Cyber-I concept, its important characteristics and basic architecture. Then, we discuss the special features of Cyber-I as compared with other related concepts and studies including AR (Augmented Reality), HCI (Human Computer Interaction), AI, artificial life, etc. The Cyber-I layered architecture and basic elements are described in detail, and the associations between Cyber-I and the corresponding real individual are explained as well. Finally, fundamental problems and challenging issues brought by Cyber-I are addressed in terms of necessary technique, security, privacy, ethic, philosophy, etc.",,第4页.xls
327,Simulating Cooperative Fire Evacuation Training in a Virtual Environment Using Gaming Technology,2014,"Fire accidents are one of the most frequently occurring disasters leading to life and property loss. Training for fire escape skills and designing efficient building evacuation plans are increasingly important research topics. Virtual environments (VE) are widely used to support training and simulating human response under emergency situations. However, current VE based training systems have limited intelligent non-player characters (NPC) which are lacking in support of fire science knowledge.This project will introduce a hybrid method combining gaming technology, agent programming and fire science knowledge to design an evacuation training system for fire wardens. The success of using professional numerical fire simulation tool to support NPC behaviour in virtual environment will provide a new way to enhance the realism of virtual environment by using high fidelity fire data sources.",,第4页.xls
328,Current management of treatment-induced bone loss in women with breast cancer treated in the United Kingdom,2006,"New therapeutic options in breast cancer have improved survival but consequently increase the relevance of late complications. Ovarian suppression/ablation and aromatase inhibitors (AI) in the adjuvant setting have improved outcome, but have clinically important adverse effects on bone health. However, investigation and management of cancer treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) is poorly defined with no national guidance. In 2004, a questionnaire was sent to over 500 breast surgeons and oncologists who treat breast cancer within the United Kingdom. The questionnaire evaluated access to bone densitometry and specialist expertise as well as attitudes to investigation of CTIBL and anticipated changes in the use of AI for postmenopausal early breast cancer. A total of 354 completed questionnaires were received, 47 from clinicians not currently treating breast cancer. Of the 307 evaluable questionnaires, 164 (53%) were from breast surgeons, 112 (36%) from clinical oncologists and 31 (10%) from medical oncologists. Although most respondents recognised that CTIBL was the responsibility of the treating breast team, investigations for CTIBL are limited even though most had adequate access to bone densitometry; 98 (32%) had not requested a DXA scan in the last 6 months and 224 (73%) had requested fewer than five scans. In all, 235 (76%) were not routinely investigating patients on AI for bone loss. A total of 277 (90%) felt that their practice would benefit from national guidelines to manage these patients, and the majority (59%) had little or no confidence in interpreting DXA results and advising on treatment. This questionnaire has highlighted clear deficiencies in management of CTIBL in early breast cancer. The development of national guidelines for the management of these patients and educational initiatives for breast teams are urgently required.",,第4页.xls
329,Identifying Unknown Adverse Drug Reaction Signal Pairs in Postmarketing Surveillance Using an Active Multi-Agent System Approach,2008,"Discovering unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance as early as possible is of great importance. The current approach to postmarketing surveillance primarily relies on spontaneous reporting. It is passive and suffers from gross underreporting (< 10% reporting rate), latency, and inconsistent reporting. We propose a novel team-based intelligent agent system approach for actively monitoring and detecting potential ADRs of interest using electronic patient records. We designed such a system and named it ADRMonitor. To evaluate the performance of the ADRMonitor with respect to the spontaneous reporting approach, we conducted simulation experiments on identification of ADR signal pairs (i.e., potential links between drugs and apparent adverse reactions) under various conditions. The experiments involved over 275,000 simulated patients created on the basis of more than 1,000 real patients treated by the drug cisapride that was on the market for seven years until its withdrawal by the FDA in 2000 due to serious ADRs. The quantitative simulation results show that (1) the ADR defection rate of the ADRMonitor agents with even moderate decision-making skills is 5 times higher than that of spontaneous reporting; (2) as the number of patient cases increases, ADRs could be detected significantly earlier by the ADRMonitor.",,第4页.xls
330,Artificial Intelligence for Industrie 4.0,2017,"The transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the fourth industrial revolution based on cyber-physical production systems is now recognized globally by highly industrialized nations. When we coined the term Industrie 4.0 in 2010, it was already clear to me that machine learning, semantic technologies, real-time action planning as well as plan recognition, collaborative robotics, and intelligent user interfaces are the scientific foundation for smart factories, smart products and smart services. AI is a key enabler for the next generation of smart manufacturing in Industrie 4.0, since it leads to a disruption in traditional workflows, supply chains, value creation, and business models in manufacturing and works towards empowering and expanding workforce expertise. The use of AI in manufacturing is paving the way to the synergistic collaboration between humans and robots in urban smart factories for mass customization [2]. In particular, we present recent results from our Industrie 4.0 projects at DFKI, including hybrid teams of human workers and collaborative robots, deep learning for predictive maintenance of networked production machines and for understanding human behaviors of shop floor workers, semantic technologies for worldwide interoperability of machine-to-machine communication in smart factories and logistics, human-aware and real-time production planning and scheduling for multiagent systems, intelligent industrial assistance systems for human workers, and proactive and situation-aware on-line help and training on the shop floor. The concept of active semantic product memories [3] that serve as digital twins invert the traditional production logic, since in Industrie 4.0 the emerging product is controlling its own production process in a service-oriented multiagent architecture. We discuss use cases from legacy factories which we have upgraded to Industrie 4.0 and show the comparative gains [1] in productivity, stock reduction, resource efficiency, retooling or changeover times, and job satisfaction.",,第4页.xls
331,Preparing for the next pandemic: Simulation-based deep reinforcement learning to discover and test multimodal control of systemic inflammation using repurposed immunomodulatory agents,2022,"Background: Preparation to address the critical gap in a future pandemic between non-pharmacological measures and the deployment of new drugs/vaccines requires addressing two factors: 1) finding virus/pathogen-agnostic pathophysiological targets to mitigate disease severity and 2) finding a more rational approach to repurposing existing drugs. It is increasingly recognized that acute viral disease severity is heavily driven by the immune response to the infection (cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome). There exist numerous clinically available biologics that suppress various proinflammatory cytokines/mediators, but it is extremely difficult to identify clinically effective treatment regimens with these agents. We propose that this is a complex control problem that resists standard methods of developing treatment regimens and accomplishing this goal requires the application of simulation-based, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in a fashion akin to training successful game-playing artificial intelligences (AIs). This proofof-concept study determines if simulated sepsis (e.g. infection-driven cytokine storm) can be controlled in the absence of effective antimicrobial agents by targeting cytokines for which FDA-approved biologics currently exist.Methods: We use a previously validated agent-based model, the Innate Immune Response Agent-based Model (IIRABM), for control discovery using DRL. DRL training used a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) approach with a clinically plausible control interval of 6 hours with manipulation of six cytokines for which there are existing drugs: Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-4 (IL-4), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and Interferon-gamma(IFNg).Results: DRL trained an Al policy that could improve outcomes from a baseline Recovered Rate of 61% to one with a Recovered Rate of 90% over similar to 21 days simulated time. This DRL policy was then tested on four different parameterizations not seen in training representing a range of host and microbe characteristics, demonstrating a range of improvement in Recovered Rate by +33% to +56%Discussion: The current proof-of-concept study demonstrates that significant disease severity mitigation can potentially be accomplished with existing antimediator drugs, but only through a multi-modal, adaptive treatment policy requiring implementation with an Al. While the actual clinical implementation of this approach is a projection for the future, the current goal of this work is to inspire the development of a research ecosystem that marries what is needed to improve the simulation models with the development of the sensing/assay technologies to collect the data needed to iteratively refine those models.",,第4页.xls

333,Towards the Understanding of Information Dynamics in Large Scale Networked Systems,2009,"Large networks of human and machine systems have staggeringly complex properties which make them difficult to analyze. This resistance to characterization is due to the fact that the number of possible interactions between the system nodes is exponential in the number of nodes. This combinatorial complexity makes such systems resistant to both formal analysis and empirical exploration. The goal of this work is to analyze a particular complex system, a system of agents that fuse information to develop shared beliefs. Primarily we seek to understand the detrimental emergent effects that might result in convergence to an incorrect belief, due to the large scale interactions of individuals. We achieve this through a two stage approach that combines the formal analysis of an abstracted version of the system with direct simulation of the system itself. The analysis of the abstraction of the system gives us a qualitative description of the system state space which can be used to guide and limit the parameter ranges over which the empirical evaluation is conducted. The particular abstraction that we use is to develop a mean field description of the system. Specifically, we assume that the influence of the remainder of the system on an individual can be replaced; for analysis purposes, with a system wide average influence. In our information propagation and fusion model, the team is connected via a network with some team members having access to sensors and others relying solely on neighbors in the network to inform their beliefs. Each agent uses Bayesian reasoning to maintain a belief about a single fact which can be true, false or unknown. Through our analysis we found that for certain parameter values, the system can converge to an incorrect belief despite primarily accurate information due to emergent effects.",,第4页.xls
334,Gender affordances of conversational agents,2012,"Conversational agents are attributed humanlike characteristics: in particular, they are often assumed to have a gender. There is evidence that gender sets up expectations that have an impact on user experiences with agents. The objective of this paper is to explore gender affordances of conversational agents. Our examination takes a holistic approach to the analysis of the application of gender stereotypes to nine chatterbots: six embodied (three male and three female), two disembodied (male and female), and a robot embodiment. Building on social psychology research, we test the persistence of gender stereotypes in the selection of conversation topics and in the elicitation of disinhibition and verbal abuse. Our study is based on quantitative textual analysis of interaction logs. A dictionary of English sexual slang and derogatory terms was developed for this study. Results show that gender stereotypes tend to affect interaction more at the relational (style) level then at the referential (content) level of conversation. People attribute negative stereotypes to female-presenting chatterbots more often than they do to male-presenting chatterbots, and female-presenting chatterbots are more often the objects of implicit and explicit sexual attention and swear words. We conclude by calling for a more informed analysis of user interactions that considers the full range of user interactions. (C) 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Setting: Women's Hospital Prof. Dr. Jose Aristodemo Pinotti. Participants: women with breast cancer under treatment with oral HT. Main outcome measures: interview and performed an adherence questionnaire (Morisky-Green) and two questionnaires of quality of life (EORTC-QLQ30/BR23). The interviews were done once in a 5-month period. Results Fifty-eight women were interviewed: 42 under treatment with tamoxifen (TX) and 16 under treatment with aromatase inhibitor (AI). Twenty-six women (44%) showed high adherence to the treatment, 31 (54%) medium adherence, and 1 (2%) low adherence. Statistical analysis showed a relation between incomplete adherence and systemic therapy side effects as well as higher stages of disease, with no difference between the two drugs. When treatments were compared, this study showed treatment with AI presented less breast symptoms and better role functioning. Quality of life score was high, compared to the reference value. Conclusions A low percentage of women with breast cancer were highly adherent to HT treatment. Low/medium adherence was associated with higher stages of disease and systemic side effects. Quality of life had high scores, with better role function and less breast symptoms in women being treated with an AI.",,第4页.xls
337,"Protocol-Based Multi-Agent Systems: Examining the Effect of Diversity, Dynamism, and Cooperation in Heuristic Optimization Approaches",2011,"Many heuristic optimization approaches have been developed to combat the ever-increasing complexity of engineering problems. In general, these approaches can be classified based on the diversity of the search strategies used, the amount of change in these search strategies during the optimization process, and the level of cooperation between these strategies. A review of the literature indicates that approaches that are simultaneously very diverse, highly dynamic, and cooperative are rare but have immense potential for finding high quality final solutions. In this work, a taxonomy of heuristic optimization approaches is introduced and used to motivate a new approach called protocol-based multi-agent systems. This approach is found to produce final solutions of much higher quality when its implementation includes the use of multiple search protocols, the adaptation of these protocols during the optimization, and the cooperation between these protocols than when these characteristics are absent.

338,A mobile robot sense net,1999,"Mobile robot (mobot) hardware and software is developing to the point where interesting applications for groups of such mobots can be contemplated. We envision a set of mobots acting to map and perform surveillance or other tasks within an indoor environment (the Sense Net). A typical application of the Sense Net would be to detect survivors in buildings damaged by earthquake or other disaster, where human searchers would be put at risk. As a team, the Sense Net could reconnoiter a set of buildings faster, more reliably, and more comprehensively than an individual mobot. The team, for example, could dynamically form subteams to perform tasks that cannot be done by individual robots, such as measuring the range to a distant object by forming a long baseline stereo sensor from a pair of mobots. In addition, the team could automatically reconfigure itself to handle contingencies such as disabled mobots.This paper is a report of our current progress in developing the Sense Net, after the first year of a two-year project.(1) In our approach, each mobot has sufficient autonomy to perform several tasks, such as mapping unknown areas, navigating to specific positions, and detecting, tracking, characterizing, and classifying human and vehicular activity. We detail how some of these tasks are accomplished, and how the mobot group is tasked.",,第4页.xls
339,Ground moving target engagement by cooperative UAVs,2005,"The purpose of this tutorial paper is to present an application example for the MultiUAV cooperative control simulation. MultiUAV has been used to simulate a Cooperative Moving Target Engagement (CMTE) scenario, with a team of UAVs acting as a sensor and communication network to cooperatively track and attack moving ground targets. This scenario illustrates the utility of MultiUAV for cooperative control applications requiring heterogeneous vehicles with varied sensor, communication, dynamic, and weapon capabilities. A human supervisor designates one or more moving ground targets for the vehicles to attack. The vehicle agents must then autonomously and cooperatively determine which vehicles will perform the required tasks, when the tasks will be performed, and what flight paths will be used. This requires assigning time-dependent cooperative and joint tasks, where multiple sub-elements of the primary task must be accomplished by different vehicles, for any of the tasks to have value. This tutorial focuses on the unique requirements of the CMTE scenario and how they are addressed in the MultiUAV simulation.",,第4页.xls
340,Improved Periodic Data Retrieval in Asynchronous Rings with a Faulty Host,2014,"The exploration problem has been extensively studied in unsafe networks containing malicious hosts of a highly harmful nature, called black holes, which completely destroy mobile agents that visit them. In a recent work, Kralovic and Miklik [SIROCCO 2010, LNCS 6058, pp. 157-167] considered various types of malicious host behavior in the context of the Periodic Data Retrieval problem in asynchronous ring networks with exactly one malicious host.In this problem, a team of initially co-located agents must report data from all safe nodes of the network to the homebase, infinitely often. The malicious host can choose whether to kill visiting agents or allow them to pass through ( gray hole). In another variation of the model, the malicious host can, in addition, alter its whiteboard contents in order to deceive visiting agents. The goal is to design a protocol for Periodic Data Retrieval using as few agents as possible. In this paper, we present the first nontrivial lower bounds on the number of agents for Periodic Data Retrieval in asynchronous ring networks. Specifically, we show that at least 4 agents are needed when the malicious host is a gray hole, and at least 5 agents are needed when the malicious host whiteboard is unreliable. This improves the previous lower bound of 3 in both cases and answers an open question posed in the aforementioned paper.On the positive side, we propose an optimal protocol for Periodic Data Retrieval in asynchronous rings with a gray hole, which solves the problem with only 4 agents. This improves the previous upper bound of 9 agents and settles the question of the optimal number of agents in the gray-hole case. Finally, we propose a protocol with 7 agents when the whiteboard of the malicious host is unreliable, significantly improving the previously known upper bound of 27 agents. Along the way, we set forth a detailed framework for studying networks with malicious hosts of varying capabilities.",,第4页.xls
341,MIP: A new hybrid multi-agent architecture for the coordination of a robot colony activities,2002,"In this paper the development and the implementation of one new robotic architecture for the coordination and the planning of a robot colonies in dangerous and unknown environments are outlined. The name of this new architecture is Metaphor of Italian Politics (MIP Architecture).The structure of this architecture is dynamics. It takes inspiration from the political organizations of the democratic governments, where the leader isn't only one robot but it is constituted by a government of robots. In the MIP architecture the robots team is coordinated by a Prime Minister, a Minister of the Defence and a Minister of Communication while a second group of robots, the Robot Citizens, are the executors of each mission.The model of the agents is hybrid (reactive and deliberative), so every robot can assume every political position inside this dynamic structure. An election procedure for the government regeneration has been developed in order to avoid the collapse of a mission and improve the robot colony performances.To validate the effectiveness of the our approach we have developed a framework based on the Mission Lab software developed at the Mobile Robot Lab of the Georgia Institute of Technology.",,第4页.xls
342,Controlling the learning process of real-time heuristic search,2003,"Real-time search provides an attractive framework for intelligent autonomous agents, as it allows us to model an agent's ability to improve its performance through experience. However, the behavior of real-time search agents is far from rational during the learning (convergence) process, in that they fail to balance the efforts to achieve a short-term goal (i.e., to safely arrive at a goal state in the present problem solving trial) and a long-term goal (to find better solutions through repeated trials). As a remedy, we introduce two techniques for controlling the amount of exploration, both overall and per trial. The weighted real-time search reduces the overall amount of exploration and accelerates convergence. It sacrifices admissibility but provides a nontrivial bound on the converged solution cost. The real-time search with upper bounds insures solution quality in each trial when the state space is undirected. These techniques result in a convergence process more stable compared with that of the Learning Real-Time A* algorithm. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls
343,Cooperative Threat Engagement Using Drone Swarms,2023,"The ability of multiple manned and unmanned aircraft systems to cooperatively engage and disable an aerial threat plays a decisive role in modern warfare scenarios. In this paper, we apply key methods to enable the so-called cooperative threat engagement capability among multiple networked agents, e.g., a swarm of drones, with combat and communication capabilities. In particular, this research combines AI-based decision-making and control techniques for a swarm of loyal wingman drones to coordinate efficient defense actions in a cooperative and autonomous manner. We apply these concepts in a defense scenario that is modeled to analyze the loyal wingman concept, which we consider an interesting testbed for cooperative decision-making and low-level control techniques. The investigated methods were implemented in a realistic 3D UAV simulator for demonstration and evaluation.",,第4页.xls

345,VCNI - Applying value theory to contextual needs identification in proactive elderly care,2009,"This paper presents a novel needs-identification system (named VCNI) that is a context-aware and value-perspective for proactive elderly care (that considers certain quality elements as consumer participation, caregiver involvement, and continuous quality improvement). We apply the value theories and principles and devise a novel method (conflict resolution algorithm) aiming for allocating an agent team with the least value conflict fashion so as to discover the contextualized mission that could fulfill the needs of the elderly. With the context information reported by pervasive components, this system can proactively provide the directions of the individualized assistance required for the elderly in maintaining an independent lifestyle and reduce possible health-care costs. To show the feasibility of the methodology proposed in the paper, a prototype system has been implemented for justifying the capability of the system's needs identification from the macro and micro perspectives. Moreover, our system also exemplifies a future way of service provision on electronic care. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls

347,Integrated reactive soccer agents,1999,"Robot soccer competition provides an excellent opportunity for robotics research, in particular, robot players in a soccer game must perform realtime visual recognition, navigate in a dynamic field, track moving objects, collaborate with teammates, and hit the ball in the correct direction. All these tasks demand robots that are autonomous (sensing, thinking, and acting as independent creatures), efficient (functioning under time and resource constraints), cooperative (collaborating with each other to accomplish tasks that are beyond individual's capabilities), and intelligent (reasoning and planing actions and perhaps learning from experience). To build such integrated robots, we should use different approaches from those employed in separate research disciplines. In the 1997 RoboCup competition. the USC/ISI robot team, called Dreamteam, fought hard and won the world championship in the middle-sized robot league. These robots all share the same general architecture and basic hardware, but they have integrated abilities to play different roles (goal-keeper, defender or forward) and utilize different strategies in their behavior. Our philosophy in building these robots is to use the least possible sophistication to make them as robust as possible. This paper describes our experiences during the competition as well as our new improvements to the team.",,第4页.xls
348,From Human-to-Human to Human-to-Bot Conversations in Software Engineering,2024,"Software developers use natural language to interact not only with other humans, but increasingly also with chatbots. These interactions have different properties and flow differently based on what goal the developer wants to achieve and who they interact with. In this paper, we aim to understand the dynamics of conversations that occur during modern software development after the integration of AI and chatbots, enabling a deeper recognition of the advantages and disadvantages of including chatbot interactions in addition to human conversations in collaborative work. We compile existing conversation attributes with humans and NLU-based chatbots and adapt them to the context of software development. Then, we extend the comparison to include LLM-powered chatbots based on an observational study. We present similarities and differences between human-to-human and human-to-bot conversations, also distinguishing between NLU- and LLM-based chatbots. Furthermore, we discuss how understanding the differences among the conversation styles guides the developer on how to shape their expectations from a conversation and consequently support the communication within a software team. We conclude that the recent conversation styles that we observe with LLM-chatbots can not replace conversations with humans due to certain attributes regarding social aspects despite their ability to support productivity and decrease the developers' mental load.",,第4页.xls
349,Using Game Days to teach a multiagent system class,2004,"Multiagent system is an attractive problem solving approach that is becoming ever more feasible and popular in today's world. It combines artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed problem solving to allow designers (programmers and engineers alike) to solve problems otherwise deemed awkward in traditional approaches that are less flexible and centralized. In the fall semester of 2002, the author introduced a new game-based technique to my multiagent systems class. The class was aimed for seniors (with special permission) and graduate students in computer science, covering some breadth and depth of issues in multiagent systems. One of the requirements was participation in four game days. On each game day, student teams competed against each other in games related to issues such as auction, task allocation, coalition formation, and negotiation. This article documents designs of and lessons learned from these game days. The game days were very successful. Through role-playing, the students were motivated and learned about multiagent systems.",,第4页.xls
350,Bioactive Phyto-Compounds with Antimicrobial Effects and AI: Results of a Desk Research Study,2024,"Resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics represents a formidable global challenge, manifesting in intricate public health ramifications including escalated mortality rates and augmented healthcare costs. The current efforts to manage antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are limited mainly to the standard therapeutic approaches. The aim of this study is to present and analyze the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the search for new phyto-compounds and novel interactions with antimicrobial effects. The ambition of the current research study is to support researchers by providing summarized information and ideas for future research in the battle with AMR. Inevitably, the AI role in healthcare is growing exponentially. The reviewed AI models reveal new data on essential oils (EOs) as potential therapeutic agents. In terms of antibacterial activity, EOs show activity against MDR bacteria, reduce resistance by sensitizing bacteria to the action of antibiotics, and improve therapeutic efficiency when combined with antibiotics. AI models can also serve for the detailed study of other therapeutic applications of EOs such as respiratory diseases, immune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and oncological diseases. The last 5 years have seen an increasing application of AI in the search for potential plant sources to control AMR. For the time being, the application of machine-learning (ML) models is greater in the studies of EOs. Future attention of research teams may also be directed toward a more efficient search for plant antimicrobial peptides (PAMPs). Of course, investments in this direction are a necessary preface, but the excitement of new possibilities should not override the role of human intelligence in directing research processes. In this report, tradition meets innovation to address the silent pandemic of AMR.",,第4页.xls
351,A cooperative population learning algorithm for vehicle routing problem with time windows,2014,"Population-based hybrid metaheuristics, often inspired by biological or social phenomena, belong to a widely used groups of methods suitable for solving complex hard optimization problems. Their effectiveness has been confirmed for providing good quality solutions to many real-life instances of different problems. Recently, an incorporation of the cooperative problem solving paradigm into metaheuristics has become an interesting extension of the population-based hybrid metaheuristics. Cooperation is meant as a problem-solving strategy, consisting of a search performed by different search agents running in parallel. During the search, the agents cooperate by exchanging information about states, solutions or other search space characteristics. This paper proposes an Agent-Based Cooperative Population Learning Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. In the proposed approach the process of search for the best solution is divided into stages, and different search procedures are used at each stage. These procedures use a set of various heuristics (represented by software agents) which run under the cooperation scheme defined separately for each stage. Computational experiment which has been carried out, confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls
352,Search modes for the cooperative multi-agent system solving the vehicle routing problem,2012,"Cooperation as a problem-solving strategy is widely used to build methods addressing complex hard optimization problems. It involves a set of highly autonomous programs (agents), each implementing a particular solution method, and a cooperation scheme combining these autonomous programs into a single problem-solving strategy. Possible form of such cooperation may be based, for example, on adaptive memory methods, where partial elements of good solutions are stored and next combined to create new complete solutions. Alternative approach is based on central memory, where complete elite solutions are exchanged among various agents and/or heuristics. Moreover, cooperatively solving a task is often combined with learning mechanism, where agents adapt their behavior to the new states of environment during the process of solving the problem.The main goal of the paper is to evaluate to what extent a mode of cooperation (synchronous or asynchronous) between a number of optimization agents cooperating through sharing a central memory influences the quality of solutions while solving instances of the Vehicle Routing Problem. The investigated search modes are evaluated using a dedicated cooperative multi-agent system allowing for various modes of cooperation and with the reinforcement learning mechanism implemented in it.

353,Towards an AI-Based Framework for Autonomous Design and Construction: Learning from Reinforcement Learning Success in RTS Games,2023,"The present study summarizes the state-of-the-art research in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in the architecture, engineering and construction industry and it formulates a general framework for autonomous design and construction. The framework is inspired by the noticeable success of DRL and imitation learning algorithms in real time strategy (RTS) games, which normally require efficient resource planning and long-term strategic coordination. The objective of the proposed framework is to reduce data segregation and loss of project information. The prevention of data leakage is achieved by replacing the linear process with an iterative one where the consequences of design decisions on the construction process (and vice versa) are understood in a virtual environment simultaneously. The proposed framework also exploits recent advances in simulated physics-based environments, like game engines. Designers and builders can therefore simulate on-site scenarios and exchange views on the required design and construction goals early in the project. The multi-objective optimization problem is then passed to artificial agents. These agents train on achieving the project goals under the supervision of a team of humans. The tacit knowledge transferred to the brain of the agents can later be deployed on-site through execution robots. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept software application, showcasing a brick pavilion project. Design and construction constraints are first imposed by the user. Agents are then trained using a DRL algorithm.",,第4页.xls
354,A Distributed Assignment Method for Dynamic Traffic Assignment Using Heterogeneous-Adviser Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,2020,"The Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) is one of the important measures to alleviate urban network traffic congestion. The congestions are usually caused by stochastic traffic demands, which are generally unassignable from time dimension in the real-world but are assumed to be assignable in existing DTA methods (i.e. real-time travel demands). In this paper, a distributed DTA method for preventing urban network traffic congestion caused by stochastic real-time travel demands by improving Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). A team structure, which consists of decision-makers and advisers, is designed to learn parallelly in realistic DTA tasks. To reduce the size of the solution space adaptively, the dynamic critical values advised by adviser agents are adopted as constraints for the strategy space of decision-makers (i.e. main agents). A collaborative heterogeneous-adviser mechanism is designed to avoid deviation of guidance. To enhance the adaptability of DTA to the changeable external environment, the mixed strategy concept is introduced to improve the decision-making process of main agents. The respective mapping mechanisms are designed to define adaptive learning rates to improve the sensitivity of MARL. The Sioux Falls (SF) network is established as a test platform via a Dynamic Network Loading (DNL). The effectiveness of the suggested DTA method is assessed through numerical simulations SF network. Under the influence of the scenario with stochastic real-time travel demands, the results show that the proposed method outperforms in terms of the throughput of the network and the individual average travel time among the overall network. Additionally, the ability of the proposed method in response to the external environment rapidly has also been demonstrated. Adopting the suggested method can improve the state of the art to assign stochastic real-time travel demands dynamically and to avoid potential traffic congestion fundamentally.",,第4页.xls
355,Multi-agent systems and their application to control vehicle underwater,2015,"An autonomous mobile robot must perform non-repetitive tasks in an imperfectly known environment and uncooperative and even hostile. In this context the missions assigned to the underwater vehicle can't be defined precisely, and this vehicle should have the capability to interpret, analyze the environment, decide on appropriate action and react to asynchronous events. It also must permanently reconfigure to adapt to external conditions and objectives. To fill the requirements and to harmonize decision, reaction and performance with distributed intelligence, the control architecture proposed it's an hybrid architecture, based on multi- agent systems, combines the benefits of reactive and deliberative architectures. In this work, we first studied the principle of the underwater vehicle; the analysis identified the desired characteristics. In the second part, we focused on multiagent systems (MAS) in order to understand the link between the approach Distributed Artificial Intelligence [1] and our project. After discussing the different control architectures in the third part, we finally treat the solution proposed in this article. The development of our architecture is based on multi- agent systems and the modeling of underwater vehicle which will be addressed in another paper. These developments are part of the overall project initiated by the team of the Computer Laboratory, systems and renewable energy (LISER) of the National School of Electrical and Mechanical (ENSEM).",,第4页.xls

358,Interactive decision support: advantages of an incomplete utility model,1998,"For effective production scheduling, manufacturers use computers to generate near optimal schedules. However, using a computer to find a single near optimal schedule requires a precise definition of optimality which must tradeoff the competing interests of production efficiency, customer satisfaction, profitability and product quality. Performing these tradeoffs automatically is beyond the fidelity of any utility model that could be constructed with reasonable effort. Scheduling systems work best as assistants to human schedulers. The system must allow the human scheduler to examine and manipulate the schedules in order for the human to arrive at the best schedule. The utility model must capture the high level factors that contribute to a good schedule, but it does not need to capture all the subtlety needed to select the best schedule. For manufacturing interests, scheduling objectives fall along four broad dimensions: time, factors that relate to on-time delivery; quality, factors related to product quality; money, factors related to profitability; and disruptions, factors related to ease of manufacture. These dimensions map to the interests of the customer service representatives, quality engineers, accountants and manufacturing supervisors respectively. The human scheduler is presented with a set of schedules that represent the Pareto-Optimal frontier and negotiates a selection between these competing points of view. We elaborate on our approach to interactive decision support and illustrate it with examples from the IBM Load Planning System, which uses an asynchronous team of agents to create schedules for shipping manufactured goods to customers.",,第4页.xls
359,Optimal assignment of collaborating agents in multi-body asset-guarding games [arXiv],2020,"We study a multi-body asset-guarding game in missile defense where teams of interceptor missiles collaborate to defend a non-manuevering asset against a group of threat missiles. We approach the problem in two steps. We first formulate an assignment problem where we optimally assign subsets of collaborating interceptors to each threat so that all threats are intercepted as far away from the asset as possible. We assume that each interceptor is controlled by a collaborative guidance law derived from linear quadratic dynamic games. Our results include a 6-DOF simulation of a 5-interceptor versus 3-threat missile engagement where each agent is modeled as a missile airframe controlled by an autopilot. Despite the assumption of linear dynamics in our collaborative guidance law and the unmodeled dynamics in the simulation environment (e.g., varying density and gravity), we show that the simulated trajectories match well with those predicted by our approach. Furthermore, we show that a more agile threat, with greater speed and acceleration, can be intercepted by inferior interceptors when they collaborate. We believe the concepts introduced in this paper may be applied in asymmetric missile defense scenarios, including defense against advanced cruise missiles and hypersonic vehicles.",,第4页.xls

361,TIMELY: Providing In-Time and Intelligent Support for Cardiovascular Rehabilitation with 'Patients and Practitioners in the Loop' Interaction,2023,"eHealth has the potential to enhance patient engagement and communication between patients and healthcare providers during Cardiovascular Rehabilitation (CR) programs. Using technological tools such as smartphone apps, physical activity trackers and medical-grade devices like heart rate and ECG monitors has been demonstrated to be effective in improving adherence and exercise capacity and in some cases achieving outcomes that are equivalent to or better than those of center-based CR programs. Multidisciplinary teams can provide patients with the support they need to make healthy lifestyle changes and address behavioral and risk factors that may contribute to cardiovascular issues. By implementing healthy behaviors, patients can also reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and improve overall mortality rates. To further support CR efforts, we propose an conversational agent that utilizes user context and AI-based cardiovascular disease risk prediction, grounded in behavioral intervention theories, in order to collaborate with AI and monitoring technology to optimize outcomes for better CR.",,第4页.xls
362,A framework for a Web-based supervisory control of mobile robots,2001,"Depicts the architecture of a framework for an assistance and service system used to control a team of mobile robots. The system aims at giving to a disabled person the ability to describe missions that the robots will have to execute in the flat. The framework includes an intuitive human-machine interface which uses a WWW navigator. This interface separates the user interface that allows the description and the launching of the missions and the administrator interface that is charged with the setup and the tests in the environment where the system will be installed. The mobile robots are endowed with the capacities needed by the collision avoidance behaviours but their low computational level does not allow them to embed all the behaviours requested by the missions they have to perform. Part of these behaviours stands on a workstation on which runs a multi-agent system. The decentralised architecture is based on a multiserver structure connected to the network and communicating by means of HTTP requests allowing a full access to and from the Internet. Nevertheless, the robots are not able to execute autonomously all kinds of missions and, therefore, the disabled person will be necessarily involved in the system.",,第4页.xls
363,Modelling Automated Planning Problems for Teams of Mobile Manipulators in a Generic Industrial Scenario,2022,"Flexible control strategies are required in industrial scenarios to coordinate the actions of mobile manipulators (e.g., robots and humans). Temporal planning approaches can be used as such control strategies because they can generate those actions for the agents that must be executed to reach the goals, from any given state of the world. To deploy such approaches, planning models must be formulated. Although available in the literature, these models are not generic enough such that they can be easily transferred to new use cases. In this work, a generic industrial scenario is derived from real scenarios. For this scenario, a generic planning problem is developed. To demonstrate their generality, the two constructs are configured for a new scenario, where custom grippers are assembled. Lastly, a validation methodology is developed for the generic planning problem. The results show that the generic industrial scenario and the generic planning problem can be easily instantiated for new use cases, without any new modelling. Further, the proposed validation methodology guarantees that these planning problems are complete enough to be used in industrial use cases. The generic scenario, the planning problems, and the validation methodology are proposed as standards for use when deploying temporal planning in industrial scenarios with mobile manipulators.",,第4页.xls

365,Lessons Learned and Future Directions of MetaTutor: Leveraging Multichannel Data to Scaffold Self-Regulated Learning With an Intelligent Tutoring System.,2022,"Self-regulated learning (SRL) is critical for learning across tasks, domains, and contexts. Despite its importance, research shows that not all learners are equally skilled at accurately and dynamically monitoring and regulating their self-regulatory processes. Therefore, learning technologies, such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), have been designed to measure and foster SRL. This paper presents an overview of over 10 years of research on SRL with MetaTutor, a hypermedia-based ITS designed to scaffold college students' SRL while they learn about the human circulatory system. MetaTutor's architecture and instructional features are designed based on models of SRL, empirical evidence on human and computerized tutoring principles of multimedia learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational systems for metacognition and SRL, and research on SRL from our team and that of other researchers. We present MetaTutor followed by a synthesis of key research findings on the effectiveness of various versions of the system (e.g., adaptive scaffolding vs. no scaffolding of self-regulatory behavior) on learning outcomes. First, we focus on findings from self-reports, learning outcomes, and multimodal data (e.g., log files, eye tracking, facial expressions of emotion, screen recordings) and their contributions to our understanding of SRL with an ITS. Second, we elaborate on the role of embedded pedagogical agents (PAs) as external regulators designed to scaffold learners' cognitive and metacognitive SRL strategy use. Third, we highlight and elaborate on the contributions of multimodal data in measuring and understanding the role of cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) processes. Additionally, we unpack some of the challenges these data pose for designing real-time instructional interventions that scaffold SRL. Fourth, we present existing theoretical, methodological, and analytical challenges and briefly discuss lessons learned and open challenges.",,第4页.xls
366,A Reinforcement Learning algorithm for neural networks with incremental learning ability,2002,"When neural networks are used for approximating action-values of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, the interference caused by incremental learning can be serious. To solve this problems in this paper, a neural network model with incremental learning ability was applied to RL problems. In this model, correctly acquired input-output relations are stored into long-term memory, and the memorized data are effectively recalled in order to suppress the interference. In order to evaluate the incremental learning ability, the proposed model was applied to two problems: Extended Random-Walk Task and Extended Mountain-Car Task. In these tasks, the working space of agents is extended as the teaming proceeds. In the simulations, we certified that the proposed model could acquire proper action-values as compared with the following three approaches to the approximation of action-value functions: tile coding, a conventional neural network model and the previously proposed neural network model.",,第4页.xls
367,Grid-Group Cm-α:: Performance prediction using environmental and cultural factors,2008,"Many environments challenge human capabilities (e.g., situational stress, waiting, fatigue from long duty hours, etc.)(1). The capability to measure and model the individual's human performance is an important first step in determining a person's or group's effectiveness in a particular situation. Human bias toward particular climates, favorite routines, capabilities and limitations strongly influence overall performance. However, the mission team and relationships amongst the team members adds a very import dimension to the performance during operations or simulations using models of humans(2). This paper presents the Grid-Group Cm-alpha method for predicting performance considering both environmental and cultural factors. The prediction method is based on Hooke's law which calculates the mechanical strain on a solid object given the applied physical stresses. Grid-Group Cm-a treats the specific cultural and environmental factors of a mission as applied stress on to the collection of individuals, the solid object. The collection of individuals has a given set of properties based on their culture and physical capacities. The resulting strain is estimated from these parameters and can be used to optimize group selection for mission objectives.",,第4页.xls
368,Searching for Black Holes in Subways,2012,"Current mobile agent algorithms for mapping faults in computer networks assume that the network is static. However, for large classes of highly dynamic networks (e.g., wireless mobile ad hoc networks, sensor networks, vehicular networks), the topology changes as a function of time. These networks, called delay-tolerant, challenged, opportunistic, etc., have never been investigated with regard to locating faults. We consider a subclass of these networks modeled on an urban subway system. We examine the problem of creating a map of such a subway. More precisely, we study the problem of a team of asynchronous computational entities (the mapping agents) determining the location of black holes in a highly dynamic graph, whose edges are defined by the asynchronous movements of mobile entities (the subway carriers). We determine necessary conditions for the problem to be solvable. We then present and analyze a solution protocol; we show that our algorithm solves the fault mapping problem in subway networks with the minimum number of agents possible, k = gamma + 1, where gamma is the number of carrier stops at black holes. The number of carrier moves between stations required by the algorithm in the worst case is O(k center dot n(C)(2) center dot l(R) + n(C) center dot l(R)(2)), where nC is the number of subway trains, and l(R) is the length of the subway route with the most stops. We establish lower bounds showing that this bound is tight. Thus, our protocol is both agent-optimal and move-optimal.",,第4页.xls
369,Distributed Cooperative Search with Collision Avoidance for a Team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using Gradient Optimization,2017,"This paper addresses the cooperative search problem for a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited field-of-view (FOV) and available overload constraints. First, the models of environment, UAV, image sensor, and communication are established. Second, a modified distributed information fusion strategy based on the Bayesian rule is proposed, which can make all the individual probability maps converge to the same one and reflect the true existence or nonexistence of targets within each cell. Third, a distributed gradient-based optimization method for path planning involved in the cooperative search is proposed and the available overload constraint of the UAV can be taken into account. Fourth, the aforementioned distributed gradient-based optimization method is improved by involving collision avoidance, establishing reasonable safety distance constraints, and using the Lagrange multiplier. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated and demonstrated via simulations. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,第4页.xls
370,Trajectory Generation for Multiagent Point-To-Point Transitions via Distributed Model Predictive Control,2019,"This letter introduces a novel algorithm for multiagent offline trajectory generation based on distributed model predictive control. Central to the algorithm's scalability and success is the development of an on-demand collision avoidance strategy. By predicting future states and sharing this information with their neighbors, the agents are able to detect and avoid collisions while moving toward their goals. The proposed algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion and reduces the computation time by more than 85% compared to previous optimization approaches based on sequential convex programming, while only having a small impact on the optimality of the plans. The approach was validated both through extensive simulations and experimentally with teams of up to 25 quadrotors flying in confined indoor spaces.",,第4页.xls
371,Modelling Effective Product Development Systems as Network-of-Networks,2014,"Whilst Product Development is the basis of engineering, increasingly complex products have a tendency to also increase the complexity of the Product Development process, and in many cases the process is not truly understood. There are many tools that have been developed for managing complexity, but few that are specific to Product Development and fewer still that provide pragmatic analyzes that can be used by decision-makers. This paper develops a methodology to apply a Network-of-Networks approach to data collected from a Product Development organization and provides an accompanying pragmatic analytical framework that can be used by decision-makers on all levels. It then uses an Agent-Based modelling approach to represent the knowledge diffusion within Product Development. This allows a microscopic analysis to complement the macroscopic analysis of the Network-of-Networks approach. This will allow an organization to analyze its current practices on both macro and micro scales, model dynamic changes to the structure of the organization and understand its internal dynamics, with respect to development teams and the design process. This will illuminate the complex system dynamics in Product Development that would otherwise be viewed of as unexpected consequences to a system intervention. This understanding will give greater ability to make suitable, risk-mitigating decisions.",,第4页.xls
372,Building Coalitions of Competitors in the Negotiation of Multiparty e-Contracts through Consultations,2015,"This paper argues that software agents may build two kinds of coalitions in e-negotiation processes. The first is the typical one in which the parties define roles, rights, guarantees before the negotiation starts. They act as a team. Either the whole coalition succeeds in the negotiation or fails. In the second one, addressed by this paper, the coalition members are competitors. They collaborate exchanging information before the negotiation trying to align their strategies to some degree. Such collaboration only occurs because there is some particularity (e.g., nearness) that can optimise their business processes if most of the coalition members succeed in the negotiation. They aim at maximising their chances of success in the negotiation, but act solo. It is important to note that the main challenge in this scenario lays on the fact that the coalition members are not bind to the coalition. They may act within the negotiation differently from what they had agreed previously. This gives rise to the concept of fairness, which is discussed in this paper. The paper also argues that the materialisation of coalitions within a negotiation protocol fits better in a multiparty negotiation protocol. Thus, it extends the SPICA Negotiation Protocol with the so-called consultations. The paper presents a study case that shows that consultations can be benefic to the suppliers, the industry and the consumers.",,第4页.xls
373,Autonomous communication using Aide de Camp,1993,"The principal aim of the Aide de Camp project is to address the problems encountered as a result of recent technological advances in computer communication capabilities. In particular the project seeks to reduce the amount of information overload to which network users are subject and to focus attention on communications which are relevant to a specific user. This has been achieved by the development of software modules known as Aides de Camp which can be tailored to the needs and interests of individual users. In particular the owner of an Aide de Camp is provided with a means for defining tasks which are then performed in an autonomous manner. These tasks are couched in terms of a high level rule based language, also developed by the project team, called TSL (Task Scripting Language). Tasks in TSL are compiled to become autonomous agents which are activated by an Aide de Camp. The significant advantage is that time consuming administrative tasks can be performed without the need for further intervention from the owner. The Aide de Camp system also has mail filtering capabilities built into it to address information overload. Further it is intended to provide the system with calendaring and diary management facilities.",,第4页.xls
374,A Bayesian-Based Approach to Human Operator Intent Recognition in Remote Mobile Robot Navigation,2021,"This paper addresses the problem of human operator intent recognition during teleoperated robot navigation. In this context, recognition of the operator's intended navigational goal, could enable an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to assist the operator in an advanced human-robot interaction framework. We propose a Bayesian Operator Intent Recognition (BOIR) probabilistic method that utilizes: (i) an observation model that fuses information as a weighting combination of multiple observation sources providing geometric information; (ii) a transition model that indicates the evolution of the state; and (iii) an action model, the Active Intent Recognition Model (AIRM), that enables the operator to communicate their explicit intent asynchronously. The proposed method is evaluated in an experiment where operators controlling a remote mobile robot are tasked with navigation and exploration under various scenarios with different map and obstacle layouts. Results demonstrate that BOIR outperforms two related methods from literature in terms of accuracy and uncertainty of the intent recognition.",,第4页.xls
375,Challenge Problems in Developing a Neuro-Symbolic OODA Loop,2023,"In this paper, we analyze the role of Neuro-Symbolic (NS) methods within the standard Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) framework and discuss their associated opportunities and challenges. To ground the discussion, we consider the OODA loop applied to a wildland firefighting use case where mixed teams of autonomous agents and humans need to collaboratively work to contain and ultimately extinguish large-scale fires. NS methods are appealing as they enable the integration of symbolic knowledge coming, for example, from time-tested firefighting tactics and procedures encoded in training manuals. However, there are key challenges in capturing and integrating such information within NS pipelines, especially in a way that is scalable with respect to the number of procedures, dynamics of the environment, and regulations. The integration of such symbolic priors within a NS OODA loop will enable autonomous systems to generate highly expressive yet compressed representations (or abstractions) of the environment and other agents' state, actions, and intent. However, NS integration brings new challenges, such as, designing abstractions that are composable and transferable across complex tasks, deciding how to ground symbols to sensory data, and verifying their validity to ensure they lead to safe decisions. Symbolic abstractions also need to deal with the fact that sensory data is uncertain-like the behavior of the fire front (boundary, rate of spread, etc.). Furthermore, prior knowledge may be incomplete and inconsistent leading to representations that need to be capable of explicitly modelling and managing ambiguity. Addressing such challenge problems will not only advance the state-of-the-art in NS AI, but also concretely demonstrate the benefits of such methods within the autonomy domain.",,第4页.xls
376,The Use of Chatbots in Digital Business Transformation: A Systematic Literature Review,2021,"The research on chatbots has gained momentum over the past few years. Academics and practitioners investigate how these tools for communication with customers or internal team can be improved in terms of their performance, acceptance, and deployment. Although there is a plethora of recent studies available, not all of them deal with the digital business transformation implications of chatbots. The main aim of the research presented in this paper was to conduct a systematic literature review of high-quality journal research papers in order to summarise the current state of research on chatbots, identify their role in digital business transformation and suggest the areas warranting further attention. 74 papers were included in the research. Topical (focus and applications), methodological (methods used, sample size, sample type, and countries studied) and bibliometric (publication outlet, citations, and Altmetric Attention Score) aspects are evaluated and described. Scholars and practitioners can use the results to identify topics, areas, and applications that are intensely discussed in the literature and require further attention, select a methodology for their research that is well established in the field or is emerging, identify the most influential publications not to be missed in their research or identify publication outlets for publishing their research on chatbots.",,第4页.xls
377,Nonlinear Control and Synchronization with Time Delays of Multiagent Robotic Systems,2011,"We investigate the cooperative control and global asymptotic synchronization Lagrangian system groups, such as industrial robots. The proposed control approach works to accomplish multirobot systems synchronization under an undirected connected communication topology. The control strategy is to synchronize each robot in position and velocity to others robots in the network with respect to the common desired trajectory. The cooperative robot network only requires local neighbor-to-neighbor information exchange between manipulators and does not assume the existence of an explicit leader in the team. It is assumed that network robots have the same number of joints and equivalent joint work spaces. A combination of the lyapunov-based technique and the cross-coupling method has been used to establish the multirobot system asymptotic stability. The developed control combines trajectory tracking and coordination algorithms. To address the time-delay problem in the cooperative network communication, the suggested synchronization control law is shown to synchronize multiple robots as well as to track given trajectory, taking into account the presence of the time delay. To this end, Krasovskii functional method has been used to deal with the delay-dependent stability problem.",,第4页.xls
378,Interoperability of cross-organizational workflows based on process-view for collaborative product development,2008,"Collaborative product development (CPD) has been widely accepted as an advanced collaboration paradigm that combines geographically distributed product development teams to develop product collaboratively and efficiently. Interoperability of cross-organizational workflows is important for CPD to facilitate the successful execution of the whole product development process across enterprises boundaries. This article, describes a timed colored petri net (TCPN) and process-view combined approach to construct cross-organizational workflows, and a three models framework of 'TCPN workflow models - Process- view workflow models - Integrated process-view workflow model' is proposed to realize the interoperability of cross-organizational workflows for CPD. A multi-agent system PVMAS provides a mediated architecture for distributed workflow management systems interoperability among cooperative enterprises. Under this architecture, a service discovery algorithm is provided for discovering the most suitable services enterprises need, a TCPN algebra model and a character string mapping algorithm are proposed to automate the mapping from a TCPN workflow model to a process-view workflow model, and the synchronization points are designated in the integrated process-view workflow model to coordinate the execution of cross-organizational workflow instances. Finally, a case study of the collaborative development of a motorcycle is presented to verify the validity of our approach for cross-organizational workflows interoperability in CPD.",,第4页.xls
379,Repairing faulty nodes and locating a dynamically spawned black hole search using tokens,2018,"In a distributed cloud, it is crucial to detect and eliminate faulty network entities in order to protect network assets and mitigate the risks associated with constantly arising attacks. Much research has been conducted on locating a single static black hole, which is defined as a network site whose existence is known a priori and that disposes of any incoming data without leaving any trace of this occurrence. In this paper, we introduce a specific attack model that involves multiple faulty nodes that can be repaired by mobile software agents, as well as what we call a gray virus that can infect a previously repaired faulty node and turn it into a black hole. The Faulty Node Repair and Dynamically Spawned Black Hole Search (FNR-DSBHS) problem that proceeds from this model is much more complex and realistic than the traditional Black Hole Search problem. We first explain why existing algorithms addressing the latter do not work under this new attack model. We then distinguish between a one-stop gray virus that, after infecting a faulty node that has been repaired, can no longer travel to other nodes; and a multi-stop gray virus. We observe that, in an asynchronous network, a solution to the FNR-DSBHS problem is possible only when dealing with a single one-stop gray virus. In that specific context, we present a solution for an asynchronous ring network using a token model, that is, a ring in which a constant number of tokens is the only means of communication between the team of agents. We claim that, in such a ring, b + 9 agents can repair all faulty nodes as well as locate the black hole that is infected by this single one-stop gray virus. We prove the correctness of the proposed solution and analyze its complexity in terms of number of mobile agents used and total number of moves performed by these agents. We show that in the worst case, within O(kn2) moves, b + 9 agents suffice to repair b faulty nodes and report the location of the black hole that is infected, at any arbitrary point in time, by the one-stop gray virus.",,第4页.xls

TITAN is a multi-year effort to develop, demonstrate and mature information and knowledge (I&K) management and dissemination (M&D) services spanning multiple echelons and provide support to the network-centric operations process with collaborative military planning and execution monitoring. TITAN integrates heterogeneous, open-source intelligent agents and web services with network-centric communications infrastructures. These agents and services are designed to support users executing the Operations Process for command and control across command echelons from units on the upper tactical internet at brigade and above to units on the lower tactical internet at battalion and below. The result is an adaptive system for collaborative battle command planning, execution and monitoring.In delivering TITAN, the team had to engineer novel solutions to several current research problems. These technical contributions include the development of a Battle Command-Warfighter (BCW) interface that integrates planning with situation awareness; definition of interoperability schemas for C2 information sources and services; management of distributed provenance; implementation of a network-centric message bus for communications across different network echelons and radios; and the development of agents and services to support Mission Command planning processes and numerous Data-to-Decision (D2D) threads in a comprehensive manner to execute TRADOC's Multi-Level Scenario.

382,Sol: An Agent-Based Framework for Cyber Situation Awareness,2012,"In this article, we describe how we augment human perception and cognition through Sol, an agent-based framework for distributed sensemaking. We describe how ourvisualization approach, based on IHMCs OZ flight display, has been leveraged and extended in our development of theFlow Capacitor, an analyst display for maintaining cyber situation awareness, and in theParallel Coordinates 3D Observatory(PC3O or Observatory), a generalization of the Flow Capacitor that provides capabilities for developing and exploring lines of inquiry. We then introduce the primary implementation frameworks that provide the core capabilities of Sol: theLuna Software Agent Framework, theVIA Cross-Layer Communications Substrate, and theKAoS Policy Services Framework. We show how policy-governed agents can perform much of the tedious high-tempo tasks of analysts and facilitate collaboration. Much of the power of Sol lies in the concept ofcoactive emergence, whereby a comprehension of complex situations is achieved through the collaboration of analysts and agents working together in tandem. Not only can the approach embodied in Sol lead to a qualitative improvement in cyber situation awareness, but its approach is equally relevant to applications of distributed sensemaking for other kinds of complex high-tempo tasks.",,第4页.xls

384,A multi-agent framework for cloud-based management of collaborative robots,2018,"This article presents a cloud-based multi-agent architecture for the intelligent management of aerial robots in a disaster response situation. In a disaster scenario, a team of highly maneuverable quadcopters is deployed to carry out surveillance and decision support in disaster-affected areas. In Pakistan, such events usually result from sudden unpredictable calamities such as earthquakes. The aim of this work is to develop a robust mechanism to autonomously manage and react to sensory inputs received in soft real time from an unstructured environment. The immediate goal is to locate the maximum number of trapped, injured people within a large area, and help first responders plan rescue activities accordingly. To evaluate the proposed framework, a number of simulations are carried out using GAMA platform to emulate a disaster environment. Subsequently, algorithms are developed to survey an affected geographical area through the use of small flight drones. The key challenges in this work are related to the combination of the domains of multi-agent technology, robotics, and cloud computing for effectively bridging the cyber world with the physical world. Therefore, the proposed work demonstrates the effective use of a limited number of drones to capture inputs from a disaster situation in the physical world, and such inputs are used for timely planning of rescue efforts. The results of fixed resource assignment are compared with the proposed reactive assignment strategy, and it clearly shows a significant improvement in terms of resource usage compared to traditional approach.",,第4页.xls

The GCM compound was mixed with a palatable nutritional paste (Nutri-cal(R) [NC]). Oral administration of the NC/GCM compound was initiated in 26 rats 10 days before immunization and continued until the day of sacrifice. One group of 12 control rats was given no oral agents; a second group of 12 control rats received NC only. Evaluations included arthritis index (AI) scoring by three independent evaluators, histologic index (Hr) scoring of lesions, T-cell proliferation, and serological studies for antibody classes and sub-classes, Both the Al and HI criteria showed a statistically significant reduction in the prevalence of CIA in rats pretreated with the NC/GCM (54%) compared to the combined control groups (96%, chi (2) analysis P = 0.001), Rats fed the NC/GCM also exhibited a significant decrease in the severity of autoimmune arthritis in both the Al and HI compared to control Group 2 (immunized-NC) (chi (2) analysis P < 0.05), Histological studies verified the decreased incidence of arthritis in the NC/GCM group compared to control Group 2.GCM treatment failed to alter T-cell proliferation and antibody production to bovine type-if collagen, indicating that its effects are not due to alteration of the antigen-specific immune response.",,第4页.xls

387,Distributed inference-based multi-robot exploration,2018,This work proposes a technique for distributed multi-robot exploration that leverages novel methods of map inference. The inference technique uses observed map structure to infer unobserved map features. The team then coordinates to explore both the inferred and observed portions of the map. Individual robots select exploration poses by accounting for expected information gain and travel costs. Disputes are settled using local auctions of expected travel costs. The benefits of inference-informed exploration are demonstrated in both simulated explorations and hardware trials. The proposed technique is compared against frontier and information-based exploration approaches with varying numbers of agents and communication strengths. Map inference is evaluated using publicly available sensor datasets. The proposed inference technique improves the correctly estimated subset of the environment by an average of 34.47% (maximum 108.28%) with a mean accuracy of 95.1%. This leads to a 13.15% reduction in the cumulative exploration path length in the trials conducted.,,第4页.xls
388,Distributed creation of Machine learning agents for Blockchain analysis [arXiv],2019,"Creating efficient deep neural networks involves repetitive manual optimization of the topology and the hyperparameters. This human intervention significantly inhibits the process. Recent publications propose various Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms that automate this work. We have applied a customized NAS algorithm with network morphism and Bayesian optimization to the problem of cryptocurrency predictions, where it achieved results on par with our best manually designed models. This is consistent with the findings of other teams, while several known experiments suggest that given enough computing power, NAS algorithms can surpass state-of-the-art neural network models designed by humans. In this paper, we propose a blockchain network protocol that incentivises independent computing nodes to run NAS algorithms and compete in finding better neural network models for a particular task.

In this new age, systems are set to become more densely intraconnected and interconnected, and massive sociotechnical systems exhibiting unprecedented levels of complexity will increasingly take hold. At the dawning of this new age, the Ergonomics discipline must reflect on its preparedness for tackling problems in these novel systems. This paper engages in this reflection by putting forth a critical commentary on the implication of these changes on the discipline and discusses the utility of our current methods in this new paradigm. A resulting Radical Systems Thinking in Ergonomics Manifesto is put forward - a set of mandates to guide practitioners and researchers in the development of new methods capable of coping with these imminent challenges.

390,Architecture Transformation: Integrating Smart Systems for Intelligent Agent-Based Service Management in Smart Organizations,2024,"In the pursuit of organizational goals, addressing the fundamental needs of employees, such as ensuring the availability of drinking water, plays a pivotal role in fostering a productive, healthy, and value-aligned work environment. This imperative necessitates the implementation of intelligent service management solutions that are both efficient and intelligent. In this research, we propose a visionary architectural transformation that seamlessly integrates intelligent agent-based smart systems within the domain of Smart Organizations. Our novel architectural approach draws inspiration from Activity Theory, strategically orchestrating interactions between employees, company objectives, and tools. Additionally, we employ a meticulously crafted 4-layer organizational system structure to delineate roles, establish rules, foster communities, and optimize task allocation. This forward- looking architecture is further fortified through the integration of cutting-edge technologies, encompassing the Internet of Things (IoT) with precision dispensing scales for real-time predictive capabilities, human-computer interaction (HCI) mobile applications and web services to enhance user-system engagement, and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI) implementations across every layer of the system. The architectural framework is consolidated within a robust Big Data platform, enabling the collection and comprehensive analysis of data on a grand scale. This multifaceted approach seeks to usher in profound and all-encompassing changes in the management of drinking water supply services, encompassing organizational paradigms, technological advancements, and methodological enhancements to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The focus of this transformation is primarily directed toward companies involved in supply activities, with particular emphasis on drinking water provisioning. Through the development of predictive system prototypes and meticulous performance analysis, our study conclusively demonstrates that the Smart System-based prediction architecture significantly enhances operational performance and elevates the quality of drinking water supply services.",,第4页.xls
391,An Introduction to Pursuit-evasion Differential Games,2020,"Pursuit and evasion conflicts represent challenging problems with important applications in aerospace and robotics. In pursuit-evasion problems, synthesis of intelligent actions must consider the adversary's potential strategies. Differential game theory provides an adequate framework to analyze possible outcomes of the conflict without assuming particular behaviors by the opponent. This article presents an organized introduction of pursuit-evasion differential games with an overview of recent advances in the area. First, a summary of the seminal work is outlined, highlighting important contributions. Next, more recent results are described by employing a classification based on the number of players: one-pursuer-one-evader, N-pursuers-one-evader, one-pursuer-M-evaders, and N-pursuer-M-evader games. In each scenario, a brief summary of the literature is presented. Finally, two representative pursuit-evasion differential games are studied in detail: the two-cutters and fugitive ship differential game and the active target defense differential game. These problems provide two important applications and, more importantly, they give great insight into the realization of cooperation between friendly agents in order to form a team and defeat the adversary.",,第4页.xls
392,Supporting effective collaboration: using a rearview mirror to look forward,2016,"Our original research, to design and develop an Intelligent Collaborative Learning System (ICLS), yielded the creation of a Group Leader Tutor software system which utilizes a Collaborative Skills Network to monitor students working collaboratively in a networked environment. The Collaborative Skills Network was a conceptualization of collaborative skills and subskills associated with particular sentence openers. The Group Leader (GL) Tutor taught students effective use of collaboration skills while they worked in Jigsaw Teams on a Local Area Network (LAN). In their discussions, students selected sentence openers associated with particular collaborative skills defined in the Collaborative Skills Network, completing them with free-form sentence closers. Subsequent researchers leveraged this system in various ways including incorporating intelligent agents, expanding the Collaborative Skills Network, and matching sentence openers with appropriate sentence closers. The universal use of the Internet, responsive user interfaces, and learning management systems (LMS) have since provided additional research opportunities using more powerful technology. The ICLS research continues to hold promise for future applications and extensions of our model to new domains. Addressing the needs of both traditional students as well as adult learners in e-learning environments, even MOOCs, may extend the reach of our research into the future. Additionally, enhanced assessment of students learning outcomes may help improve their collaborative skills.",,第4页.xls
393,Anonymous Meeting in Networks,2016,"A team consisting of an unknown number of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different times, have to meet at the same node. Agents are anonymous (identical), execute the same deterministic algorithm and move in synchronous rounds along links of the network. An initial configuration of agents is called gatherable if there exists a deterministic algorithm (even dedicated to this particular configuration) that achieves meeting of all agents in one node. Which configurations are gatherable and how to gather all of them deterministically by the same algorithm? We give a complete solution of this gathering problem in arbitrary networks. We characterize all gatherable configurations and give two universal deterministic gathering algorithms, i.e., algorithms that gather all gatherable configurations. The first algorithm works under the assumption that a common upper bound on the size of the network is known to all agents. In this case our algorithm guarantees gathering with detection, i.e., the existence of a round for any gatherable configuration, such that all agents are at the same node and all declare that gathering is accomplished. If no upper bound on the size of the network is known, we show that a universal algorithm for gathering with detection does not exist. Hence, for this harder scenario, we construct a second universal gathering algorithm, which guarantees that, for any gatherable configuration, all agents eventually get to one node and stop, although they cannot tell if gathering is over. The time of the first algorithm is polynomial in the upper bound on the size of the network, and the time of the second algorithm is polynomial in the (unknown) size itself. Our results have an important consequence for the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs. Leader election is a fundamental symmetry breaking problem in distributed computing. Its goal is to assign, in some common round, value 1 (leader) to one of the entities and value 0 (non-leader) to all others. For anonymous agents in graphs, leader election turns out to be equivalent to gathering with detection. Hence, as a by-product, we obtain a complete solution of the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs.",,第4页.xls

395,Decentralized Adaptive Optimal Control for Massive Multi-agent Systems Using Mean Field Game with Self-Organizing Neural Networks,2019,"In this paper, a decentralized adaptive optimal control based on the Mean Field game and self-organizing neural networks has been developed for multi-agent systems (MAS) with a large population and uncertain dynamics. This design can effectively break Curse of dimensionality as well as reduce the computational complexity through appropriately integrating emerging mean-field game theory with self-organizing neural networks based reinforcement learning technique. Firstly, decentralized optimal control for massive multi-agent systems has been formulated as a mean field game. To obtain the mean-field game solution, coupled Hamiltonian-Jacobian-Bellman (HJB) equation and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation needed to be solved simultaneously which is challenging in real-time. Therefore, a novel Actor-Critic-Mass (ACM) structure has been developed along with self-organizing neural networks. In the developed ACM structure, each agent has three neural networks (NN), which is, 1) mass NN that learns the team's overall behavior via online estimating the solution of Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation, 2) critic NN that obtains the optimal cost function via learning the Hamiltonian-Jacobian-Bellman (HJB) equation solution along with time. 3) actor NN that estimates the decentralized optimal control by using the critic and mass NNs. To reduce the NNs computational complexity, a self-organizing neural network has been adopted that can adjusting NNs' architecture based on the NN learning performance as well as the computation cost. Eventually, numerical simulation has been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme.",,第4页.xls
396,Unintended consequences of collocation: using agent-based modeling to untangle effects of communication delay and in-group favor,2008,"In studies about office arrangements that have individuals working from remote locations, researchers usually hypothesize advantages for collocators and disadvantages for remote workers. However, empirical findings have not shown consistent support for the hypothesis. We suspect that there are unintended consequences of collocation, which can offset well-recognized advantages of being collocated. To explain these unintended consequences, we developed a multi-agent model to complement our laboratory-based experiment. In the lab, collocated subjects did not perform better than the remote even though collocators had faster communication channels and in-group favor towards each other. Results from the multi-agent simulation suggested that in-group favoritism among collocators caused them to ignore some important resource exchange opportunities with remote individuals. Meanwhile, communication delay of remote subjects protected them from some falsely biased perception of resource availability. The two unintended consequences could offset the advantage of being collocated and diminish performance differences between collocators and remote workers. Results of this study help researchers and practitioners recognize the hidden costs of being collocated. They also demonstrate the value of coupling lab experiments with multi-agent simulation.",,第4页.xls
397,A situatedness-based Knowledge Plane for autonomic networking,2008,"IP networks, and particularly the Internet, were proposed to be a simple and robust support for homogeneous communications. This implies that only basic control mechanisms have to be performed by network elements. Communication management has to be performed by the terminals. However, the integration of new services and the increasing need for QoS require the network to be increasingly more flexible and adaptive. New algorithms and protocols have been proposed by many research teams to address these issues, but these new algorithms tend to make network management and control more flexible. Thus, manual configuration of such flexible and adaptive network architectures is very complex, if not impossible. Self-management is then a good opportunity to address this new complexity, and then to integrate more easily new services into the network. However, this self-management requires the equipment to carry much more knowledge and information than the actual control and management planes do. Global knowledge management schemes are therefore necessary to achieve this, including new policies for knowledge gathering, computing, sharing and providing. To address this particular need for knowledge management, several studies have proposed building a new plane, called the 'Knowledge Plane' (KP). This paper studies different propositions for this KP, and presents an original vision of what this KP should be. Our vision of the KP relies on the paradigm of situatedness. This paradigm was developed by research studies in the field of multi-agent systems, which tend to solve complex problems using collaborative and autonomous agents (multi-agent technology has been largely described in Artificial Intelligence literature). These agents in our proposition are embedded within the network elements themselves. Their role is to share local and situated knowledge composing the global KP. We have also developed, as an illustration, a distributed intrusion detection system (IDS) based on the local IDS Snort. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,第4页.xls

399,A Virtual Agent to Support Individuals Living With Physical and Mental Comorbidities: Co-Design and Acceptability Testing,2019,"Background: Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent.Objective: This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content.Methods: We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care.Results: Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone.Conclusions: Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.",,第4页.xls
400,A multiagent framework for learning dynamic traffic management strategies,2019,"There is strong commercial interest in the use of large scale automated transport robots in industrial settings (e.g. warehouse robots) and we are beginning to see new applications extending these systems into our urban environments in the form of autonomous cars and package delivery drones. This new technology comes with new risks-increasing traffic congestion and concerns over safety; it also comes with new opportunities-massively distributed information and communication systems. In this paper, we present a method that leverages the distributed nature of the autonomous traffic to provide improved traffic throughput while maintaining strict capacity constraints across the network. Our proposed multiagent-based dynamic traffic management strategy borrows concepts from both air traffic control and highway metering lights. We introduce controller agents whose actions are to adjust the robots' perceived costs of traveling across different parts of the traffic network. This approach allows each robot the flexibility of using its own (potentially proprietary) navigation algorithm, while still being bound by the rules of the road. The control policies of the agents are defined as neural networks whose weights are learned via cooperative coevolution across the entire traffic management team. Results in a real world road network and a simulated warehouse domain demonstrate that our multiagent traffic management system provides substantial improvements to overall traffic throughput in terms of number of successful trips in a fixed amount of time, as well as faster average traversal times.",,第4页.xls
401,Adaptive constrained CM-based multicarrier-CDMA receivers in multipath fading channels,2013,"Two blind adaptive receivers, based on constrained constant modulus (CM) algorithms, are investigated for the detection of the multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) system in the multiuser and multipath channels. As the data rate of the information bit is getting high enough, the transmitted signal of the MC-CDMA system becomes more sensitive to the frequency-selective fading. To mitigate this drawback, the parallel transmissions of multiple data symbols within one OFDM block are employed in the proposed systems to ensure that the length of the cyclic prefix (CP) is longer than the delay spread of the multipath channel. The first receiver is called a full-tap receiver (TDes receiver), which can carry out the interference suppression in the frequency-domain. Alternatively, a reduced-tap receiver (TRTap) is proposed on the basis of the derived cyclically shifting matrix. According to the derived matrix representation of the received signal, the analytical steady-state mean square errors (MSEs) for both receivers are also derived and compared. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed receivers and validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. As expected, the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the full-tap receiver is better than that of the reduced-tap receiver in severe interference environments. In contrast, the reduced-tap receiver can provide the satisfied SER performance just like the full-tap receiver in low-interference scenarios, even though the former one adopts only one-tap equalization.",,第4页.xls
402,The design and effect of automated directions during scenario-based training,2014,"During scenario-based training, the scenario is dynamically adapted in real time to control the storyline and increase its effectiveness. A team of experienced staff members is required to manage and perform the adaptations. They manipulate the storyline and the level of support during their role-play of important characters in the scenario. The costs of training could be reduced if the adaptation is automated by using intelligent agent technology to control the characters within a virtual training environment (a serious game). However, such a system also needs a didactical component to monitor the trainee and determine necessary adaptations to the scenario. This paper investigates the automation of didactical knowledge and the corresponding dynamic adaptation of the scenario. A so-called director decides upon and distributes the necessary changes in real-time to the characters. First, the nature and goals of the adaptations are analyzed. Subsequently, the paper introduces a conducted study into the applicability of directable scenarios. Thereafter, an experiment is introduced that investigates the effects of directorial interventions upon the instructive quality of the scenario. Qualitative results indicated that trainees experienced scenario-based training to be instructive and motivating. Moreover, quantitative results showed that instructors rated directed scenarios as significantly better attuned to the trainee's needs compared to non-directed scenarios. Our future research will focus at the design of an architecture for automatically directed scenario-based training. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls
403,A collaborative Design for Usability approach supported by Virtual Reality and a Multi-Agent System embedded in a PLM environment,2010,"This paper details a collaborative workstation design approach integrating knowledge based on engineering process, using a Multi-Agent System (MAS) on a Virtual Reality (VR) platform. The MAS supports R&D teams to extract and re-use engineering knowledge so as to improve their efficiency in developing new products. Our research targets the development of a knowledge engineering system integrated into a PLM - Product Life cycle Management - environment linked with virtual reality tools. A PLM is a strategic business approach with a consistent set of methodologies and software solutions. It is meant to promote collaborative creation, management, delivery and proper use of this life cycle definition and information product in multinational companies. This system is used by engineers to carry out projects in a collective way while conveying a defined process. The MAS allows capitalization, and to annotate knowledge according to the actions of the designers inside a PLM environment. Then, this knowledge is used by VR tools to analyze various aspects of the virtual prototype such as manufacturing, maintenance, reliability or ergonomics. Consequently, we use expert knowledge to pilot the design process of a virtual prototype inside a three-dimensional immersive virtual reality platform. In this context, our paper describes our knowledge management approach applied to improve ergonomics and collaborative design in industrial areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

404,Bias reduction using combined stain normalization and augmentation for AI-based classification of histological images,2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis is an ongoing revolution in pathology. However, a frequent drawback of AI models is their propension to make decisions based rather on bias in training dataset than on concrete biological features, thus weakening pathologists' trust in these tools. Technically, it is well known that microscopic images are altered by tissue processing and staining procedures, being one of the main sources of bias in machine learning for digital pathology. So as to deal with it, many teams have written about color normalization and augmentation methods. However, only a few of them have monitored their effects on bias reduction and model generalizability. In our study, two methods for stain augmentation (AugmentHE) and fast normalization (HEnorm) have been created and their effect on bias reduction has been monitored. Actually, they have also been compared to previously described strategies. To that end, a multicenter dataset created for breast cancer histological grading has been used. Thanks to it, classification models have been trained in a single center before assessing its performance in other centers images. This setting led to extensively monitor bias reduction while providing accurate insight of both augmentation and normalization methods. AugmentHE provided an 81% increase in color dispersion compared to geometric augmentations only. In addition, every classification model that involved AugmentHE presented a significant increase in the area under receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC) over the widely used RGB shift. More precisely, AugmentHE-based models showed at least 0.14 AUC increase over RGB shift-based models. Regarding normalization, HEnorm appeared to be up to 78x faster than conventional methods. It also provided satisfying results in terms of bias reduction. Altogether, our pipeline composed of AugmentHE and HEnorm improved AUC on biased data by up to 21.7% compared to usual augmentations. Conventional normalization methods coupled with AugmentHE yielded similar results while being much slower. In conclusion, we have validated an open-source tool that can be used in any deep learning-based digital pathology project on H&E whole slide images (WSI) that efficiently reduces stain-induced bias and later on might help increase pathologists' confidence when using AI-based products.",,第4页.xls
405,Gaze Feedback and Pedagogical Suggestions in Collaborative Learning Investigation of Explanation Performance on Self's Concept in a Knowledge Integration Task,2018,"Learning by doing, such as when learners give explanations to peer learners in collaborative learning, is known to be an effective strategy for gaining knowledge. This study used two types of facilitation technology in a simple explanation task to experimentally investigate those influence on the performance of understanding self's concept during collaborative explanation activity. Dyads were given a topic about cognitive psychology and were required to use two different theoretical concepts, each of which was provided separately to one or the other of them, and explain the topic to each other. Two types of facilitation were examined: (1) use of a pedagogical conversational agent (PCA) and (2) visual gaze feedback using eye-track sensing. The PCA was expected to enable greater support of task-based activity (task-work) and visual gaze feedback to support learner coordination within the dyads (teamwork). Results show that gaze feedback was effective when there was no PCA, and the PCA was effective when there was no gaze feedback on explaining self's concept. This work provides preliminary implications on designing collaborative learning technologies using tutoring agents and sensing technology.",,第4页.xls
406,Towards monitoring of group interactions and social roles via overhearing,2004,"We are investigating how to provide intelligent, pervasive support of group of people within so-called smart environments. Our current main assumption, based on literature in psychology and organizational studies, is that a group performs some complex, routine task as a structured activity, that is, by following some protocols that allow its members to coordinate and share a common understanding about the current progress towards the group's goal and the roles currently played by each member. If this is the case, a condition to provide support to a group activity by artificial agents is to share the same understanding. To this end, we have identified two initial goals: first, being able to understand if a group activity is progressing with respect to its expected evolution, by analyzing what is happening within the smart environment; second, recognizing what are the social roles of the group members, taking in mind that these are not necessarily pre-assigned and may change in time. This paper sketches a preliminary approach to these issues and a computational model for an overhearer agent. We suggest a preliminary set of rules for conversation analysis and social role recognition, and validate them against the simple case of implicit organizations, which being artificial - follow well-known protocols.",,第4页.xls
407,CORVETTE: Collaborative Environment for Technical Training and Experiment,2014,"The CORVETTE project aims at producing significant innovations in the field of collaborative virtual training. For that purpose, CORVETTE combines various technologies to enhance the effective collaboration between users and virtual humans performing a common task. First, CORVETTE proposes a model of collaborative interaction in virtual environments allowing actors to efficiently collaborate as a team whether they are controlled by a user or by a virtual human [4]. Moreover, the environment is simulated in real-time, at real scale and is using physics as well as physically-based humanoids to improve the realism of the training. Second, thanks to the interaction model, we defined a protocol of exchange of avatars [5, 3, 2]. Thus, an actor can dynamically exchange the control of his/her avatar with the one controlled by another user or by a virtual agent. Moreover, to improve the exchange protocol, we designed a new knowledge model embedded in each avatar. It allows users and virtual humans to retrieve knowledge previously gathered by an avatar following an exchange. The preservation of knowledge is indeed especially crucial for teamwork. Finally, we handle verbal communication between users and virtual humans with speech recognition and synthesis. Actors' knowledge is enhanced through dialogue and used for decision-making and conversation [1].[GRAPHICS].",,第4页.xls
408,Target tracking with distributed sensors: The focus of attention problem,2005,"In this paper, we consider the problem of assigning sensors to track targets so as to minimize the expected error in the resulting estimation for target locations. Specifically, we are interested in how disjoint pairs of bearing or range sensors can be best assigned to targets to minimize the expected error in the estimates. We refer to this as the focus of attention (FOA) problem. In its general form, FOA is NP-hard and not well approximable. However, for specific geometries we obtain significant approximation results: a 1.42-approximation algorithm for stereo cameras on a line, a (I + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for any constant 6 when the cameras are equidistant, and a 1.42-approximation algorithm for equally spaced range sensors on a circle. In addition to constrained geometries, we further investigate the problem for general sensor placement. By reposing as a maximization problem-where the goal is to maximize the number of tracks with bounded error-we are able to leverage results from maximum set-packing to render the problem approximable. We demonstrate the utility of these algorithms in simulation for a target tracking task, and for localizing a team of mobile agents in a sensor network. These results provide insights into sensor/target assignment strategies, as well as sensor placement in a distributed network. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls
409,Coalitions in Agricultural Supply Chains: A Behavioral Approach in Multi-party Automated Contract Negotiation,2017,"Coalition formation builds a team of agents aiming at a certain goal or increasing their performance. Coalition formation on agricultural supply chains may allow a few chain's members to take advantage of some common feature (e.g., a shared resource) to better position themselves, for instance, performing better negotiations. SPICA Framework provides means for automated negotiation of multi-party contracts within an agricultural supply chain. SPICA negotiation protocol was enhanced to allow the coalition of negotiators. This paper introduces a few behavioral traits, namely, aggressiveness and fairness, to model the behavior of negotiators efficiently in a coalition and assesses how they impact the negotiation outcome. We survey the scenarios for building coalitions in supply chains and propose a way to model the behavior of coalitions based on a characterization of the risks inherent to them. The model is realized within an existing framework for the negotiation of multi-party contracts. We also present a running example in which a few negotiators can share a common resource and, in doing so, they become more competitive and more successful in signing a multi-party contract. The results show that the proposed model is able to reproduce expected outcomes of distinct behavior traits.",,第4页.xls
410,Explanation and argumentation capabilities:: Towards the creation of more persuasive agents,2002,"During the past two decades many research teams have worked on the enhancement of the explanation capabilities of knowledge-based systems and decision support systems. During the same period, other researchers have worked on the development of argumentative techniques for software systems. We think that it would be interesting for the researchers belonging to these different communities to share their experiences and to develop systems that take advantage of the advances gained in each domain.We start by reviewing the evolution of explanation systems from the simple reasoning traces associated with early expert systems to recent research on interactive and collaborative explanations. We then discuss the characteristics of critiquing systems that test the credibility of the user's solution. The rest of the paper deals with the different application domains that use argumentative techniques. First, we discuss how argumentative reasoning can be captured by a general structure in which a given claim or conclusion is inferred from a set of data and how this argument structure relates to pragmatic knowledge, explanation production and practical reasoning. We discuss the role of argument in defeasible reasoning and present some works in the new field of computer-mediated defeasible argumentation. We review different application domains such as computer-mediated communication, design rationale, crisis management and knowledge management, in which argumentation support tools are used. We describe models in which arguments are associated to mental attitudes such as goals, plans and beliefs. We present recent advances in the application of argumentative techniques to multi-agent systems. Finally, we propose research perspectives for the integration of explanation and argumentation capabilities in knowledge-based systems and make suggestions for enhancing the argumentation and persuasion capabilities of software agents.",,第4页.xls
411,Intelligent navigation and multi-vehicle coordination,1999,"The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and Utah State University's Center for Self-Organizing and Intelligent Systems have developed a team of autonomous robotic vehicles. This paper discusses the development of a strategy that uses a sophisticated, highly intelligent sensor platform to allow centralized coordination between smaller and inexpensive robots. The three components of the multi-agent cooperative scheme are small-scale robots, large-scale robots, and the central control station running a mission and path-planning software. The smaller robots are used for activities where the probability of loss increases, such as Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) or mine detonation. The research is aimed at building simple, inexpensive multi-agent vehicles and an intelligent navigation and multi-vehicle coordination system suitable for UXO, environmental remediation or mine detection. These simplified robots are capable of conducting hunting missions using low-cost positioning sensors and intelligent algorithms. Additionally, a larger sensor-rich intelligent system capable of transporting smaller units to outlying remote sites has been developed. The larger system interfaces to the central control station and provides navigation assistance to multiple low-cost vehicles. Finally, mission and path-planning software serves as the operator control unit, allowing central data collection, map creation and tracking, and an interface to the larger system as well as each smaller unit. The power of this scheme is the ability to scale to the appropriate level for the complexity of the mission.",,第4页.xls

413,Modeling the Effect of Product Architecture on Mass-Collaborative Processes,2011,"Traditional product development efforts are primarily based on well-structured and hierarchical product development processes. The products are systematically decomposed into subsystems that are designed by dedicated teams with well-defined information flows. Over the last 2 decades, a new product development approach called mass-collaborative product development (MCPD) has emerged. The fundamental difference between a traditional product development process and a MCPD process is that the former is based on top-down decomposition while the latter is based on evolution and self-organization. The paradigm of MCPD has resulted in highly successful products such as Wikipedia, Linux, and Apache. Despite the success of various projects using MCPD, it is not well understood how the product architecture affects the evolution of products developed using such processes. Toward addressing this gap, we present an agent-based model to study the effect of product architectures in MCPD processes. The model is executed for different architectures ranging from slot architecture to bus architecture and the rates of product evolution are determined. The agent-based modeling approach allows us to study how (a) the degree of modularity of products and (b) the sequence of decoupling affect the evolution time of individual modules and overall products developed through MCPD processes. The approach is presented using the architecture of mobile phones as an illustrative example. This approach provides a simple and intuitive way to study the effects of product architecture on the MCPD processes. It is helpful in determining suitable strategies for product decomposition and module decoupling, and in identifying the product architectures that are suitable for MCPD processes.

415,Mutual and external synchronization control of multi-robot systems,2010,"In this article, we investigate the synchronization of robot manipulators group under coordinated and cooperative scheme. In cooperative schemes all agents were fully interconnected, such that all robots have a weight on the overall dynamics. In the coordinated schemes the leader robot or the master robot establishes the synchronized action of all the slave systems. Based on emergent consensus algorithm, the proposed controller works to position synchronization of multiple robot manipulators. The control strategy is to synchronize the angular position and the velocity of each robot in the system with respect to the common desired trajectory and the angular positions and velocities of other robots. Modeled by an undirected graph, the cooperative robots network only requires local neighbor-to-neighbor information exchange between manipulators and does not assume the existence of an explicit leader in the team. However the objective in coordinated scheme is to design interconnections and feedback controllers for the slaves, such that their positions and velocities synchronize to those of the leader robot. It is assumed that network robots have the same number of joints and any configuration made possible by one in the group can be completed by each robot in the cooperative system.",,第4页.xls
416,Knowledge management system of an industry-specific research and education complex,2019,"Topicality of the research is determined by the fact that it addresses the issue of a gap between actual production and professional education. Digitalization creates ample opportunities for the development of the leading material production industries (transport industry is among them) due to the totality of technologies, including knowledge engineering. This fuels digital transformations of professional education. The form of syllabus presentation is changing due to the use of ontologies as a contemporary standard of knowledge representation, and this ensures semantic openness of educational resources. Information technologies in education are changing: the management of educational paths is assigned to artificial intelligent training agents (AI-based tutors). The existing model of education is changing: it is becoming personalized. Finally, the nature of interaction between the industry and industry-specific universities and colleges is changing as well. The paper provides a business model of interaction between production, science, and professional education through an integrated life cycle of knowledge. The knowledge management system of the industry-specific research and education complex is regarded as a mechanism for implementation of this model. Its structure and tools developed by the team of the Transport Information Technologies research laboratory in the Siberian Transport University (Novosibirsk) are described.",,第4页.xls
417,Order Matters: Generating Progressive Explanations for Planning Tasks in Human-Robot Teaming,2021,"Prior work on generating explanations in a planning context has focused on providing the rationale behind an AI agent's decision-making. While these methods offer the right explanations, they fail to heed the cognitive requirement of understanding an explanation from the explainee or human's perspective. In this work, we set out to address this issue by considering the order for communicating information in an explanation, or the progressiveness of making explanations. Progression is the notion of building complex concepts on simpler ones, which is known to benefit learning. In this work, we investigate a similar effect when an explanation is composed of multiple parts that are communicated sequentially. The challenge here lies in determining the order for receiving different parts of an explanation that would assist in understanding. Given the sequential nature, a formulation based on goal-based MDP is presented. The reward function of this MDP is learned via inverse reinforcement learning based on training data. We evaluated our approach in an escape-room domain to demonstrate its effectiveness. Upon analyzing the results, it revealed that the desired order arises strongly from both domain-dependent and independence features. This result confirmed our expectation that the process of understanding an explanation for planning tasks was progressive and context dependent. We also showed that the explanations generated using the learned rewards achieved better task performance and simultaneously reduced cognitive load. These results shed light on designing explainable robots across various domains.",,第4页.xls
418,Knowledge-based telecooperation,1993,"Telecooperation is a part of the research field computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). Geographically and temporally distributed agents (people, systems) are trying to solve a problem in a team by using a suitable infrastructure. Telecooperation systems support this kind of work. But using telecooperation systems means the formation of new problems. Because telecooperation systems are very complex, their design and implementation require a high measure of experiences and knowledge. But such a comprehensive knowledge will be available only after many years of professional experiences. Often the same problems occur in the design of different telecooperation systems, because they possess same or similar elements, relations and functionalities. Nevertheless they are analysed, defined and implemented at every development of a new telecooperation system. This leads us to the idea of designing a development environment for `the construction of cooperative applications'. Therefore our aim is the realization of a knowledge-based multimedia communication shell (KMC-Shell). It will simplify the development of telecooperation systems. In keeping with the user requirements such systems can be development with the least possible programming effort. The 4-Level-Model of Telecooperation forms the basis of the KMC-Shell. It reflects the process of refinement, which must be performed in order to develop a telecooperation system for a special application.",,第4页.xls

421,Prompt engineering a schizophrenia chatbot: utilizing a multi-agent approach for enhanced compliance with prompt instructions,2024,"Patients with schizophrenia often present with cognitive impairments that may hinder their ability to learn about their condition. These individuals could benefit greatly from education platforms that leverage the adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. While LLMs have the potential to make topical mental health information more accessible and engaging, their black-box nature raises concerns about ethics and safety. Prompting offers a way to produce semi-scripted chatbots with responses anchored in instructions and validated information, but prompt-engineered chatbots may drift from their intended identity as the conversation progresses. We propose a Critical Analysis Filter for achieving better control over chatbot behavior. In this system, a team of prompted LLM agents are prompt-engineered to critically analyze and refine the chatbot's response and deliver real-time feedback to the chatbot. To test this approach, we develop an informational schizophrenia chatbot and converse with it (with the filter deactivated) until it oversteps its scope. Once drift has been observed, AI-agents are used to automatically generate sample conversations in which the chatbot is being enticed to talk about out-of-bounds topics. We manually assign to each response a compliance score that quantifies the chatbot's compliance to its instructions; specifically the rules about accurately conveying sources and being transparent about limitations. Activating the Critical Analysis Filter resulted in an acceptable compliance score (>=2) in 67.0% of responses, compared to only 8.7% when the filter was deactivated. These results suggest that a self-reflection layer could enable LLMs to be used effectively and safely in mental health platforms, maintaining adaptability while reliably limiting their scope to appropriate use cases.",,第4页.xls
422,Development of information security in the Internet of Things,2019,"The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to billions of physical devices around the world that are connected to the Internet for data collection and sharing. With cheap processors and wireless networks, it is possible that everything will be part of the IoT - from the tablet to the plane. This adds artificial intelligence to devices, allowing them to communicate without human intervention and combining the digital and physical worlds. The problem of constructing mechanisms for protecting multi-agent robotic systems from attacks by embedded intruder robots is considered. A class of so-called soft attacks using message interception, generation and transmission of misinformation to a team of robots, as well as carrying out other actions that do not have identifiable signs of the invasion of intruder robots, is considered. A theoretical security model for multi-agent robotic systems is proposed, which is based on the zonal security model and the police station model for distributed computing systems. The main idea underlying the proposed subject-object model of access control is that in addition to the entities of thesubjectandobject, a logically independent entity - the police station - is introduced into the information system; this entity, in accordance with the concept of the appeal security monitor, has the function of checking legitimacy access and/or integrity of transactions spatially distributed within the region of subjects and objects. Thus, it is proposed to design an initially homogeneous multi-agent system as a heterogeneous one, in which, in addition to executing agents, there are agents designed exclusively for solving security tasks: identification and authentication, access control, key generation and distribution, and agents location analysis. In order to solve the last task, the region is divided into several zones, for which zonal and interzonal security procedures are introduced. The model efficiency is illustrated by an example of its use when constructing the protection mechanism of the classical iterative task of distributing the robots force assignment for several purposes. At that, the order of interaction of agents with the police stations of their zone and the implementation of the interzonal security policy are shown.",,第4页.xls
423,Distributed coordination of emergency medical service for angioplasty patients,2016,"In this paper we study the coordination of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) for patients with acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI). This is a health problem with high associated mortality. A golden standard treatment for STEMI is angioplasty, which requires a catheterization lab and a highly qualified cardiology team. It should be performed as soon as possible since the delay to treatment worsens the patient's prognosis. The decrease of the delay is achieved by coordination of EMS, which is especially important in the case of multiple simultaneous patients. Nowadays, this process is based on the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) principle and it heavily depends on human control and phone communication with high proneness to human error and delays. The objective is, therefore, to automate the EMS coordination while minimizing the time from symptom onset to reperfusion and thus to lower the mortality and morbidity resulting from this disease. In this paper, we present a multi-agent decision-support system for the distributed coordination of EMS focusing on urgent out-of-hospital STEMI patients awaiting angioplasty. The system is also applicable to emergency patients of any pathology needing pre-hospital acute medical care and urgent hospital treatment. The assignment of patients to ambulances and angioplasty-enabled hospitals with cardiology teams is performed via a three-level optimization model. At each level, we find a globally efficient solution by a modification of the distributed relaxation method for the assignment problem called the auction algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed model is demonstrated by simulation experiments.",,第4页.xls
424,The Economic Metaphor of Italian Politics for dynamic coalition regeneration in the robocup competition of Aibo robots,2005,"The variation version of the Economic Metaphor of Italian Politics [3] [4] [5] [6] [10], an architecture that loosely takes inspiration from the political organizations of democratic governments, following the example of italian government, and which provides a solution for the coordination of a spare colony of robots, is competent to allow the coordination of the behaviors of a team of four robots in order to play soccer in the robocup competition. The development of an evolution of Economic Metaphor of Italian Politics is now outlined. This new approach proposes a mechanism to make a new coalition caused by the failure of the government strategy and by a general inefficiency of the whole colony during the reaching of the mission targets, such as goals scored, faults committed and other soccer parameters (game evolution, score, time left, past team coalition performances). The main characteristic of the proposed frameworks lies in its dynamic reconfigurability in order to adapt the robot colony behaviors to high dynamic environmental changes choosing from time to tine the best coalition capable to apply the most suitable soccer strategy, (from an extreme offensive to a total defensive), for the current game situation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach we have realized a framework based on the MissionLab robot simulation software developed at the Mobile Robot Lab of the Georgia Institute of Technology and we have transferred these framework inside the OPEN-R environment of the team of four Sony Aibo Ers-7 Robots.",,第4页.xls

FBI agents swarmed the Bellagio Hotel where he was staying and arrested the 23-year-old Russian citizen thought to be the mastermind behind the Mega-D botnet, capable of sending out 10 billion spam emails a day promoting counterfeit versions of Rolex watches, herbal supplements, and prescription drugs. Nikolaenko was indicted in US federal court for violating the federal CAN-SPAM Act, which carries a possible prison term of five years. He is being held without bond in a Wisconsin detection facility by US Marshals. Nikolaenko symbolizes the new face of cybercrime: a smart young Russian who uses his skills to make millions of dollars through cybercrime rather than through legitimate business in his home country.

A literature review of existing frameworks is introduced, with emphasis on their characteristics of hybridization, cooperation, and parallelism, particularly focusing on issues related to the use of multi-agents. For the comparative analysis, a set of twenty-two characteristics was listed, according to four categories: basics, advanced, multi-agent approach and support to the optimization process. Strategies used in hybridization, such as parallelism, cooperation, decomposition of the search space, hyper-heuristic and multi-agent systems are assessed in respect to their use in the various analyzed frameworks. Specific features of multi-agent systems, such as learning and interaction between agents, are also analyzed. The comparative analysis shows that the hybridization is not a strong feature in existing frameworks. On the other hand, proposals using multi-agent systems stand out in the implementation of hybrid methods, as they allow the interaction between metaheuristics. It also notes that the concept of hyper-heuristic is little explored by the analyzed frameworks, as well as there is a lack of tools that offer support to the optimization process, such as statistical analysis, self-tuning of parameters and graphical interfaces. Based on the presented analysis, it can be said that there are important gaps to be filled in the development of Frameworks for Optimization using metaheuristics, which open important possibilities for future works, particularly by implementing the approach of multi-agent systems.

427,Innovative models for supporting operational planning,2014,"Innovative simulation models are proposed for supporting operational planning related to civil military cooperation (CIMIC) and psychological operations (PSYOPs) within complex scenarios. The paper describes these models as well as the experimentation in situations involving crisis and conflicts (i.e., Afghanistan); these models are based on the intelligent agent computer generated forces (IA-CGF) developed by simulation team and they have been extensively used in CIMIC and planning research in complex operational realistic network (CAPRICORN) project, an initiative led by University of Genoa for European Defense Agency (EDA). The proposed models take care both of logistics and operational issues as well as of the effects on the people and interest groups; indeed the paper proposes the simulator developed to demonstrate these capabilities that include the communications among the stakeholders, the population models as well as the effects of human factors including social and cultural aspects. The paper includes experimental results based on this simulator devoted to validate and test the models in strong cooperation with final users and subject matter experts (SME); the proposed experimentation is based on design of experiment techniques including mean square pure error (MSpE) and sensitivity analysis.",,第4页.xls
428,Development and application of on-line dynamic security early warning and preventive control system in China,2010,"This paper presents an early warning and preventive control system for dynamic security, which has been used in several provincial power grids in China. The framework and the main modules of the proposed system are introduced. The system architecture is based on a Multi-agent system which is developed by our team. The modules like on-line contingency assessment, total transfer capacity evaluation, preventive and corrective control schemes etc. are developed in this system. To estimate the forthcoming state's security level, all these modules also run in the forecasted 15-minutes ahead operating state. And some key technologies, such as PEBS based contingency screen and distributed computing technology, are used to improve the efficiency of the system to accommodate real-time application. Enhanced total transfer capacity calculating (TTC) method are developed which can both calculate pessimistic value and optimistic value of TTC in the same time. The preventive control algorithm is developed which is based on transient energy function sensitivity. Some engineering-oriented methods are also introduced which are used to solve practical problems emerged in real application.

429,The save me project real-time disaster mitigation and evacuation management system,2012,"Even though safety systems are present in every transportation hub, there are still crucial outstanding issues to be addressed and resolved. Public infrastructures such as tunnels and metro stations are paradigms, where travellers are frequently jammed at the exits, even under normal evacuation. Existing safety systems fail to guide effectively the most vulnerable travellers and to take into consideration the mobility impairment of each individual. In this context, current work, within SAVE ME project, proposes a robust evacuation mechanism from disaster areas in public transport terminals and infrastructures, which is incorporated in our Decision Support System (DSS). The DSS provides group-wised and personalized optimal routes to the exits, taking into consideration the personal preferences and capabilities of the travellers, along with guidelines to the rescue teams, given that rescuers must be sent to prioritized targets with trapped travellers. Furthermore, an innovative contribution of this work is the service personalization platform that was implemented in order to ensure the personalized communication of each traveller with the DSS. Service personalization is based on an intelligent agent framework. The paper provides a thorough analysis of existing evacuation models and mechanisms, presents the DSS architecture, its embedded algorithms, and the service personalization platform. Finally it discusses its performance based on the two SAVE ME project pilot trials in Colle Capretto tunnel in Umbria, Italy and in Monument metro station in Newcastle, UK.",,第4页.xls
430,GenoTEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-Based Exploration of Gene Expression Data in Alignment with Bioinformaticians,2024,"Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets. However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automatic exploration of gene expression data, involving the tasks of dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide range of gene identification problems, in a full analysis pipeline that follows the standard of computational genomics. These annotations are curated by human bioinformaticians who carefully analyze the datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgents, a team of LLM-based agents designed with context-aware planning, iterative correction, and domain expert consultation to collaboratively explore gene datasets. Our experiments with GenoAgents demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches in genomics data analysis, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing AI-driven methods for genomics data analysis. We make our benchmark publicly available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTex.",,第4页.xls
431,Artificial intelligence exploitation in facility management using deep learning,2020,"Purpose- This paper aims to apply a methodology that is capable to classify and localize mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) elements to assist facility managers. Furthermore, it assists in decreasing the technical complexity and sophistication of different systems to the facility management (FM) team. Design/methodology/approach- This research exploits artificial intelligence (AI) in FM operations through proposing a new system that uses a deep learning pre-trained model for transfer learning. The model can identify new MEP elements through image classification with a deep convolutional neural network using a support vector machine (SVM) technique under supervised learning. Also, an expert system is developed and integrated with an Android application to the proposed system to identify the required maintenance for the identified elements. FM team can reach the identified assets with bluetooth tracker devices to perform the required maintenance. Findings- The proposed system aids facility managers in their tasks and decreases the maintenance costs of facilities by maintaining, upgrading, operating assets cost-effectively using the proposed system. Research limitations/implications- The paper considers three fire protection systems for proactive maintenance, where other structural or architectural systems can also significantly affect the level of service and cost expensive repairs and maintenance. Also, the proposed system relies on different platforms that required to be consolidated for facility technicians and managers end-users. Therefore, the authors will consider these limitations and expand the study as a case study in future work. Originality/value- This paper assists in a proactive manner to decrease the lack of knowledge of the required maintenance to MEP elements that leads to a lower life cycle cost. These MEP elements have a big share in the operation and maintenance costs of building facilities.",,第4页.xls
432,Severe Acne Inversa - Dermatosurgical Approach in a Bulgarian Patient.,2017,"We present a 55-year-old male patient - a smoker, admitted to a Medical Institute of MVR (Ministry of the interior, Sofia, Bulgaria), on occasion of pain and swellings, located in the area of both axillae, accompanied by purulent discharge, with bloody admixtures. Bilateral localised cystic rose above the skin surface, hyperpigmented nodules interconnected with multiple fistulas, was observed within the dermatological examination, resulting in a limitation of the possibility of movement of the hands in all directions. A subjective complaint of pain was obtained on palpation. Solid bilateral axillar cicatrices - formation was also established, which additional impeded the movements of the upper limbs. The disease was generalised affecting additional inguinal, femoral and perineal areas, while at this stage the patient refused categorically eventual photo documentation of them. The diagnosis of acne inversa was made based on the available clinical and para-clinical data, as dual antibiotic therapy with Clindamycin 300 mg, two times per day was initiated for two months, in combination with rifampicin 300 mg, two times per day also for two months. This led to a significant improvement in the clinic symptoms and the patient was hospitalised for radical surgery. A surgical management of the clinical findings was planned by an interdisciplinary team including surgeons and dermatologists. The procedure was performed under general anaesthesia. After a thorough cleaning of the operative field, a radical excision of the lesion in the left axillary and para axillar region was performed, comprising the skin and subcutaneous tissue forward the fascia pectoralis. Tissue was dissected in depth in the form of number 4, thereby creating the conditions for adaptation of the initially encountered communicating with each other skin defects. Two tubular drains were placed, followed by gradual suturing of skin and subcutaneous tissue with final applying of a sterile dressing. Effective medical treatment of patients (as in our case) with severe AI is limited. Adalimumab is the first biological approved for moderate to severe AI but does not result in stable CR (cure rate). Therefore its use in a neoadjuvant setting is under investigation. Wide local excision significantly reduces pain and improves the quality of life of AI patients. While local recurrences rate is low, the satisfaction with the cosmetic results is high. The recurrence rate is dependent on the region affected and the type of surgery. While in the axillary region primary closure may be used to reduce the time to healing, anogenital AI has the lowest recurrence rate of healing by secondary intention.",,第4页.xls
433,Megesterol acetate as an overlooked cause of hyperglycemia in end-stage renal disease: A case of polypharmacy,2024,"Objectives: This case report highlights an overlooked cause of hyperglycemia and risk of polypharmacy in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Case summary: A 75-year-old non-English speaking male with T2DM, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention, and ESRD secondary to IgG Kappa nephropathy on nightly peritoneal dialysis reported a loss of appetite, decrease in weight, and an increase in symptoms of depression. As a result of these symptoms, his nephrologist initiated megestrol acetate (MA), an agent commonly used in ESRD to help stimulate appetite and improve weight. After starting MA, his blood glucose (BG) significantly worsened, due to its glucocorticoid properties. Basal insulin was started to manage his hyperglycemia, but there was minimal improvement in BG. As the patient was referred to the endocrinology clinical pharmacist for diabetes management, it was identified that his weight loss began after starting dulaglutide, which led to a weight loss of 11 kg (12.9%). The Naranjo algorithm was used, and he had a score of 6, which is a probable reaction. The patient's endocrinology and nephrology teams agreed to discontinue MA and dulaglutide as they resulted in opposing effects on appetite and BG, as well as insulin glargine. The patient's BG was tightly controlled off MA and his appetite, weight, and mood improved off dulaglutide. Practice implications: This case report reflects the potential effects of polypharmacy in ESRD, resulting in poor patient outcomes and drug interactions. It is imperative that a comprehensive medication reconciliation is completed on all patients, especially for patients on dialysis. It is also important for healthcare professionals to be cognizant of medications that may exhibit glucocorticoid properties, which can cause hyperglycemia. Including a clinical pharmacist in the care team can assist with medication reconciliation, screening for drug interactions and polypharmacy, and optimizing chronic disease management.

435,SBD system design,1996,"A simulation-based approach to concurrent engineering enables early consideration of downstream life cycle processes by supporting the development of virtual prototypes of products and processes and providing for their simulation and evaluation in synthetic environments representing the entire product life cycle. To be effective, a system supporting such an approach must adopt a highly integrated view of concurrent engineering. This includes the provision of rich, dynamically extensible product and process descriptions, availability of high-level computing environments facilitating assembly and invocation of design analysis tools and simulations, and an overall collaborative framework supporting distributed product design and development teams. Each of these areas is being incorporated into the development of the Simulation-Based Design (SBD) Phase II system prototype. The specific approach taken to the design of the SBD system was to define the essential capabilities of a domain independent concurrent engineering framework by focusing on fundamental engineering processes, which we consider to be applicable throughout the product life cycle. In particular, we are focusing on supporting engineering design processes. This reflects our view that many life cycle processes, such as manufacturing, maintenance, and damage control, can be considered as design problems in themselves. A basic set of capabilities should thus provide support across the range of life cycle activities. In this paper, we describe the components of a framework which supports these capabilities.",,第4页.xls
436,Recognition and prediction of motion situations based on a qualitative motion description,2004,"High-level online methods become more and more attractive with the increasing abilities of players and teams in the simulation league. As in real soccer, the recognition and prediction of strategies (e.g. opponent's formation), tactics (e.g. wing play, offside traps), and situations (e.g. passing behavior) is important. In 2001, we proposed an approach where spatio-temporal relations between objects are described and interpreted in order to detect some of the above mentioned situations. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach that enables us to both interpret and predict complex situations. It is based on a qualitative description of motion scenes and additional background knowledge. The method is applicable to a variety of situations. Our experiment consists of numerous offside situations in simulation league games. We discuss the results in detail and conclude that this approach is valuable for future use because it is (a) possible to use the method in real-time, (b) we can predict situations giving us the option to refine agents actions in a game, and (c) it is domain independent in general.",,第4页.xls
437,A methodology for Web-enabling a computer-based patient record with contributions from cognitive science,2001,"Cognitive science is a rich source of insight for creative use of new Web technologies by medical informatics workers. I outline a project to Web-enable an existing computer-based patient record (CPR) in the context of ideas from philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology. Web prototypes play an important role (a) because Web technology lends itself to rapid prototype development, and (b) because prototypes help team members bridge among disparate medical, computing, and business ontologies. Six Web-enabled CPR prototypes were created and ranked. User scenarios were generated using a user communication matrix. Resulting prototypes were compared according to the degree to which they satisfied medical, computing, and business constraints. In a different organization, or at different time, candidate prototypes and their ranking might have been different. However, prototype generation and comparison are fundamentally influenced by factors usefully understood in a cognitive science framework.",,第4页.xls
438,Implementation of Intelligent Chatbot in Student Portal: A Systematic Literature Review,2022,"The student portal gives users access to the channels of information and resources that they require for their academic pursuits. This includes access to the library services, information about their courses, and academic-related materials. On the other hand, this progress is not without its problems, as most of these services have a finite lifespan while the team still supports them. The student portal should build an artificial intelligence (AI) agent, like a chatbot, to provide 24/7 support for its users. This Chatbot must have a straight-forward user interface or GUI with excellent efficiency; hence it must be a simple system that users with minimal technical understanding can operate. It is intended that by acting as a customer support representative, a chatbot can enhance the user experience on student portal. This paper presents the findings from systematic literature review on previous works of intelligent chatbot implementation in student portal. Out of six main journal search engines and 100 articles found related to this study, only 21 articles are taken into consideration for further analysis. The results from existing studies on chatbot are tagged to nine categories based on content, and the findings are elaborated in terms of the implementation challenges of chatbot for student portal.",,第4页.xls
439,PROTECT - A Deployed Game-Theoretic System for Strategic Security Allocation for the United States Coast Guard,2012,"While three deployed applications of game theory for security have recently been reported, we as a community of agents and AI researchers remain in the early stages of these deployments; there is a continuing need to understand the Core principles for innovative security applications of game theory. Toward that end, this article presents PROTECT a game-theoretic system deployed by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in the Port of Boston for scheduling its patrols. USCG has termed the deployment of PROTECT in Boston a success; PROTECT is currently being tested in the Port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment.PROTECT is premised on an attacker-defender Stackelberg game model and offers five key innovations. First, this system is a departure from the assumption of perfect adversary rationality noted in previous work, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary's behavior - to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of the QR model. Second, to improve PROTECT's efficiency, we generate a compact representation of the defender's strategy space, exploiting equivalence and dominance. Third, we show how to practically model a real maritime patrolling problem as a Stackelberg game. Fourth, our experimental results illustrate that PROTECT's QR model more robustly handles real-world uncertainties than a perfect rationality model. Finally, in evaluating PROTECT, this article for the first time provides real-world data: comparison of human-generated versus PROTECT security schedules, and results from an Adversarial Perspective Team's (human mock attackers) analysis.",,第4页.xls

The main conditions to solve this task successfully are timely detection and elimination of emergency situations aboard a spacecraft. The article forms the purposes, principles, overall architecture, functional characteristics and basic requirements to creation of an automated system of decision-making support in emergencies on the ISS. The paper describes generalised functional structure of the automated system of decision-making support in emergency situations, the most important parameters characterising the emergency depressurisation, the main formats to display the ISS status and oversight of crew activities while depressurisation based on real flight data and while emergency situation simulation. When choosing the recommended solutions, it is proposed to use classic methods of the decision-making theory based on the representation of the emergency countering process in the form of Markov network with discrete states, and multiagent technologies.

441,Formation Dependency in Event-driven Hybrid Learning Classifier Systems for Soccer Video Games,2008,"In this paper, we discuss dependencies on player formation when using a classifier system in a decision algorithm for agents in a soccer game. Our aim is to respond to the changing environment of video gaming that has resulted from the growth of the Internet, and to provide bug-free programs in a short time. We have already proposed a bucket brigade algorithm and a procedure for choosing what to learn depending on the frequency of events with the aim of facilitating real-time learning while a game is in progress. We have also proposed a hybrid system configuration that combines existing algorithm strategies with a classifier system, and we have reported on the effectiveness of this hybrid system. In this paper, we pit players in several different formations against each other and show that the proposed system is able to learn regardless of the differences in formation. We also show that by performing simulations ahead of time, it is possible to investigate formations that will be effective against an opponent's formation. Finally, by investigating changes in frequency and success rates for each type of play due to changes in formation, we show that it is possible to acquire a team strategy for the current formation through learning.",,第4页.xls
442,"GRSTAPS: Graphically Recursive Simultaneous Task Allocation, Planning, and Scheduling",2022,"Effective deployment of multi-robot teams requires solving several interdependent problems at varying levels of abstraction. Specifically, heterogeneous multi-robot systems must answer four important questions: what (task planning), how (motion planning), who (task allocation), and when (scheduling). Although there are rich bodies of work dedicated to various combinations of these questions, a fully integrated treatment of all four questions lies beyond the scope of the current literature, which lacks even a formal description of the complete problem. In this article, we address this absence, first by formalizing this class of multi-robot problems under the banner Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning with Spatiotemporal Constraints (STAP-STC), and then by proposing a solution that we call Graphically Recursive Simultaneous Task Allocation, Planning, and Scheduling (GRSTAPS). GRSTAPS interleaves task planning, task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning, performing a multi-layer search while effectively sharing information among system modules. In addition to providing a unified solution to STAP-STC problems, GRSTAPS includes individual innovations both in task planning and task allocation. At the task planning level, our interleaved approach allows the planner to abstract away which agents will perform a task using an approach that we refer to as agent-agnostic planning. At the task allocation level, we contribute a search-based algorithm that can simultaneously satisfy planning constraints and task requirements while optimizing the associated schedule. We demonstrate the efficacy of GRSTAPS using detailed ablative and comparative experiments in a simulated emergency-response domain. Results of these experiments conclusively demonstrate that GRSTAPS outperforms both ablative baselines and state-of-the-art temporal planners in terms of computation time, solution quality, and problem coverage.",,第4页.xls

New evidence underscores its significance in patients' morbidity and mortality, length of stay, as well as healthcare costs. Globally, the factors that contribute to antimicrobial resistance include social and economic determinants, healthcare governance, and environmental interactions with impact on humans, plants, and animals. Antimicrobial stewardship (AS) programs have historically overlooked surgical teams as they considered them more difficult to engage. This review aims to summarize the evolution and significance of AS in surgical wards, including the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and the role of diagnostic stewardship (DS).

446,Architecture of agents design support system for complex systems simulation models,2015,The paper discusses problems of automating the creation of complex systems simulation models. The authors have chosen a multi-agent simulation approach as basic modeling tool. They propose software architecture for designing multi-agent models. The main tasks of a software system are: creating conceptual model; supporting the transformation process from conceptual model into agent model; decreasing qualification requirements in programming for domain experts; collaboration of research teams. The distinction of proposed software is conceptual model explicit representation in the concept-attribute relation form and applying expert system approach to transform designed ontology into an agent model. Researchers develop the structure and behavior of agents using declarative approach. An agent declarative description is based on storing information about the agent structure and behavior separately from its implementation. The article proposes developing an agent describing mechanism allowing unified creating classes of agents that are significantly different from each other in structure and behavior. In this case a standard (unified) agent will have the following structure: states block containing agent characteristics; declarative block containing agent behavior strategy in the form of production rules; imperative block containing software implementation of calculation procedures used in the inference process. Modern tools for expert systems design are used for declarative block implementation.,,第4页.xls
447,A Minimally Invasive Approach Towards Ecosystem Hacking With Honeybees.,2022,"Honey bees live in colonies of thousands of individuals, that not only need to collaborate with each other but also to interact intensively with their ecosystem. A small group of robots operating in a honey bee colony and interacting with the queen bee, a central colony element, has the potential to change the collective behavior of the entire colony and thus also improve its interaction with the surrounding ecosystem. Such a system can be used to study and understand many elements of bee behavior within hives that have not been adequately researched. We discuss here the applicability of this technology for ecosystem protection: A novel paradigm of a minimally invasive form of conservation through Ecosystem Hacking. We discuss the necessary requirements for such technology and show experimental data on the dynamics of the natural queen's court, initial designs of biomimetic robotic surrogates of court bees, and a multi-agent model of the queen bee court system. Our model is intended to serve as an AI-enhanceable coordination software for future robotic court bee surrogates and as a hardware controller for generating nature-like behavior patterns for such a robotic ensemble. It is the first step towards a team of robots working in a bio-compatible way to study honey bees and to increase their pollination performance, thus achieving a stabilizing effect at the ecosystem level.",,第4页.xls
448,Can Adam Smith's Invisible Hand phenomenon be used for the analysis of Fourth Estate's impact and behavior?,2020,"Paper presents research conducted in order to understand why neural networks from Evolution point of view are developing in such a strange way. When observing development of species, development of consistent neural network is always stopped on certain level and is continued as development of distributed, cooperating neural networks. Such networks are organized into social structures. Adam Smith's Invisible Hand (ASIH) phenomena emerges here as key factor to understand this. ASIH is perceived here as meta-computational process on platform of local neural networks, hosted by agents. ASIH theoretically is able to provide self-regulation for social structures, better than any centralized structure (dictator, government, authority) can do. Contrary to deterministic computational processes in today's digital computers, the computational processes that are behind Invisible Hand are: unconscious, nondeterministic, multithread, chaotic and non-continuous. This research methodology has provided astonishing results:Understanding of Elementary Invisible Hand, which is ruling so efficiently anthill. On this basis Artificial Invisible Hand can be derived to provide self-control of teams of AI mobile robots for situations when human-supervisor cannot assist them or management is too complicated;Invisible Hand applied to problem of understanding the Fourth (4th) Estate allowed, for the first time, to point to very clear, well visible real (not abstract) case of Invisible Hand;The 4th Estate on the platform of modern electronic media (MEM) emerges as a new worldwide governing superpower.",,第4页.xls

450,Sharing design perspectives through storytelling,2002,"Design consists of analyzing scenarios and proposing artifacts, obeying the initial set of requirements that lead from initial to goal state. Finding or creating alternative solutions, analyzing them, and selecting the best one are expected steps in the designer's decision making process. Very often, not a sole designer, but a team of them is engaged in the design process, sharing their expertise and responsibility to achieve optimum projects. In a design team, most conflicts occur due to misunderstanding of one's assessment of specifications and contexts. Decision explanations play a key role in teamwork success. Designers are rational agents trained to follow rational methods. Acceptable justifications include value function, requirements, constraints, and criteria. Generally, explanations are delivered in a multimedia fashion, composed of text, graphics and gestures, to provide the audience the ability to perceive what was contextually imagined. The more spatial the reasoning is, the richer the explanation channel should be. This paper presents CineADD, a design explanation generation model based on cinema techniques such as animation, scripting, editing, and camera movements. The idea is to provide designers with a tool for describing the way their projects should be visually explained, as in a movie. Designers develop their projects in an active design document environment. Rationale is captured as a design model, so explanations can be generated instead of retrieved. The captured design model serves as a base to visually reconstruct design, giving emphasis and guidance by using movie storytelling techniques. CineADD was implemented for the domain of oil pipeline layout showing the feasibility of this approach. We expect CineADD to become a commodity attachable to any intelligent CAD system.",,第4页.xls
451,MR-Simulator: A Simulator for the Mixed Reality Competition of RoboCup,2011,"Simulations play an important roll in the development of intelligent and collaborative robots. In this paper we describe the development of a simulator for the RoboCup Mixed Reality (MR) competition. MR uses a mix of simulated and real world to foster intelligent robotics development. Our simulator virtualizes the players within the MR hardware and software framework, providing the game server with the player-positional information usually supplied by the central vision system. To do that the simulator, after receiving the action commands from each agent (player) must track its expected trajectory and behavior in collision events for all the players. We developed fast algorithms for simulating the robot motion in most usual cases. The simulator was validated comparing its results against the real environment and proved to be realistic. This tool is important for setting-up, training and testing MR competition teams and could help to overcome current difficulties with robot hardware acquisition and maintenance.",,第4页.xls
452,Relationship between specific adverse events and efficacy of exemestane therapy in early postmenopausal breast cancer patients.,2012,"BACKGROUND: Many adverse events (AEs) associated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) involve symptoms related to the depletion of circulating estrogens, and may be related to efficacy. We assessed the relationship between specific AEs [hot flashes (HF) and musculoskeletal AEs (MSAE)] and survival outcomes in Dutch and Belgian patients treated with exemestane (EXE) in the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial. Additionally, the relationship between hormone receptor expression and AEs was assessed.METHODS: Efficacy end points were relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM), starting at 6 months after starting EXE treatment. AEs reported in the first 6 months of treatment were included. Specific AEs comprised HF and/or MSAE. Landmark analyses and Cox proportional hazards models assessed survival differences up to 5 years.RESULTS: A total of 1485 EXE patients were included. Patients with HF had a better RFS than patients without HF [multivariate hazard ratio (HR) 0.393, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.813; P = 0.012]. The occurrence of MSAE versus no MSAE did not relate to better RFS (multivariate HR 0.677, 95% CI 0.392-1.169; P = 0.162). Trends were maintained for OS and BCSM. Quantitative hormone receptor expression was not associated with specific AEs.CONCLUSIONS: Some AEs associated with estrogen depletion are related to better outcomes and may be valuable biomarkers in AI treatment.",,第4页.xls
453,Knowledge-based computer systems for radiotherapy planning.,1990,"Radiation therapy is one of the first areas of clinical medicine to utilize computers in support of routine clinical decision making. The role of the computer has evolved from simple dose calculations to elaborate interactive graphic three-dimensional simulations. These simulations can combine external irradiation from megavoltage photons, electrons, and particle beams with interstitial and intracavitary sources. With the flexibility and power of modern radiotherapy equipment and the ability of computer programs that simulate anything the machinery can do, we now face a challenge to utilize this capability to design more effective radiation treatments. How can we manage the increased complexity of sophisticated treatment planning? A promising approach will be to use artificial intelligence techniques to systematize our present knowledge about design of treatment plans, and to provide a framework for developing new treatment strategies. Far from replacing the physician, physicist, or dosimetrist, artificial intelligence-based software tools can assist the treatment planning team in producing more powerful and effective treatment plans. Research in progress using knowledge-based (AI) programming in treatment planning already has indicated the usefulness of such concepts as rule-based reasoning, hierarchical organization of knowledge, and reasoning from prototypes. Problems to be solved include how to handle continuously varying parameters and how to evaluate plans in order to direct improvements.",,第4页.xls
454,Real World Smart Chatbot for Customer Care using a Software as a Service (SaaS) Architecture,2017,"It's being very important to listen to social media streams whether it's twitter, facebook, messenger, LinkedIn, email or even company own application. As many customers may be using this streams to reach out to company because they need help. The company have setup social marketing team to monitor this stream. But due to huge volumes of users it's very difficult to analyses each and every social message and take a relevant action to solve users grievances, which lead to many unsatisfied customers or may even lose a customer. This papers proposes a system architecture which will try to overcome the above shortcoming by analyzing messages of each ejabberd users to check whether it's actionable or not. If it's actionable then an automated Chatbot will initiates conversation with that user and help the user to resolve the issue by providing a human way interactions using LUIS and cognitive services. To provide a highly robust, scalable and extensible architecture, this system is implemented on AWS public cloud.",,第4页.xls
455,Adjustment of knowledge-connection structure affects the performance of knowledge transfer,2011,"The influences of the network properties on the transfer of knowledge within the network have been extensively studied. However, the knowledge properties of the network largely less-attended in literature. In this paper we investigate whether the performance of knowledge transfer in a network can be influenced by adjusting the knowledge-connection structure of that network, as a primitive attempt to study knowledge transfer from the aspect of the knowledge properties of the network. By the knowledge-connection structure we mean the network structure that describes the knowledge distribution within the network. Therefore, the agent-based modeling approach is adopted in this paper to compare the performance of knowledge transfer in a series of networks which differ from one another in their knowledge-connection structures. The results of computational simulations illustrate that the network adjustment to increase the knowledge diversity in the directly-connected agent-pairs is helpful for improving the overall performance of knowledge transfer in the entire network in the short term; but the improvement of the long-term performance is less significant. Especially, if the local knowledge-exchange follows the mutually-advantageous bidirectional-knowledge-diffusion (BKD) model, the proposed network adjustment would instead hamper the long-term effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Further investigations show that the limitations can be overcome by adopting a periodical re-adjustment mechanism, through which the knowledge diversity in the network is maintained and persistent knowledge flow becomes possible.

456,GC-CDSS: Personalized gastric cancer treatment recommendations system based on knowledge graph,2024,"Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, gastric cancer treatment strategies emphasize a multidisciplinary team (MDT) consultation approach. However, there are numerous treatment guidelines and insights from clinical trials. The application of AI-based Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) in tumor diagnosis and screening is increasing rapidly. Objective: The purpose of this study is to (1) summarize the treatment decision process for GC according to the treatment guidelines in China, and then create a knowledge graph (KG) for GC, (2) based on aforementioned KG, built a CDSS and conducted an initial feasibility evaluation for the current system. Methods: Firstly, we summarized the decision-making process for treatment of GC. Then, we extracted relevant decision nodes and relationships and utilized Neo4j to create the KG. After obtaining the initial node features for building the graph embedding model, graph embedding algorithm, such as Node2Vec and GraphSAGE, were used to construct the GC-CDSS. At last, a retrospective cohort study was used to compare the consistency between GC-CDSS and MDT in treatment decision making. Results: In current study, we introduce a GC-CDSS, which is constructed based on Chinese GC treatment guidelines knowledge graph (KG). In the KG, we define four types of nodes and four types of relationships, and it comprise a total of 207 nodes and 300 relationships. Regarding GC-CDSS, the system is capable of providing dynamic and personalized diagnostic and treatment recommendations based on the patient's condition. Furthermore, a retrospective cohort study is conducted to compare GC-CDSS recommendations with those of the MDT group, the overall consistency rate of treatment recommendations between the auxiliary decision system and MDT team is 92.96%. Conclusions: We construct a GC treatment support system, GC-CDSS, based on KG. The GC-CDSS may help oncologists make treatment decisions more efficient and promote standardization in primary healthcare settings.",,第4页.xls
457,Co-operative strategy for an interactive robot soccer system by reinforcement learning method,2003,"This paper presents a cooperation strategy between a human operator and autonomous robots for an interactive robot soccer game. The interactive robot soccer game has been developed to allow humans to join into the game dynamically and reinforce entertainment characteristics. In order to make these games more interesting, a cooperation strategy between humans and autonomous robots on a team is very important. Strategies can be pre-programmed or learned by robots themselves with learning or evolving algorithms. Since the robot soccer system is hard to model and its environment changes dynamically, it is very difficult to pre-program cooperation strategies between robot agents. Q-learning - one of the most representative reinforcement learning methods - is shown to be effective for solving problems dynamically without explicit knowledge of the system. Therefore, in our research, a Q-learning based learning method has been utilized. Prior to utilizing Q-learning, state variables describing the game situation and actions' sets of robots have been defined. After the learning process, the human operator could play the game more easily. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed strategy, some simulations and games have been carried out.",,第4页.xls
458,A prototype Distributed Adaptive Learning System,2002,"The authors report on a Distributed Adaptive Learning System (DALS) project at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This project grew out of work reported previously by the first author [6], in which he described a generic DALS based on his KAL model of human learning comprised of three interacting components, a Knowledge Space, a collection of intelligent agents called an Agency and a Learner Space. The DALS view of a Learner is an electronic file called the Learner Filter. What DALS presents to the Learner is called a Knowledge View. The DALS Agency manages the interface between Knowledge Views and Learner Filters. The current project implements a basic prototype DALS as a proof of concept of the earlier work. The DALS prototype was developed by a graduate student, Sachin Sood, under the supervision of the first author. The third author, Bhavesh Advani, also a graduate student, is designing and integrating a Multiple Intelligence module into the prototype to provide an innovative new presentation mode. The goal of this project is to create a very broad foundation within which to assemble the many ideas and techniques for adaptive interaction currently available or being developed in both the academic and commercial venues. An underlying premise is that adaptive interaction strategies are propelling us toward practical theories for knowledge organization and user profiling, where users may be individuals, teams or large organizations, with objectives to learn, sell, persuade or govern, to mention a few possible goals. In our project the paradigm is an individual learner; but the model applies in other contexts as well.",,第4页.xls
459,Adaptive robot soccer defence strategy via behavioural trail,2012,"Robot soccer is a challenging platform for multi-agent research, involving topics such as real-time image processing and control. A team of robots must work together to put the ball in the opponent's goal while at the same time defending their own goal. A good strategy for the robot defenders can determine who wins the robotic soccer game. Therefore, the goal of this study is to propose a strategy for the defenders using a production rule based on state diagrams. The rule can facilitate easy and rapid comprehension of certain behaviors with respect to two indicators, such as condition and action. The authors determine five key aspects as conditions, including the positions of two defender robots, the position of the goalkeeper and the ball, and coordination between two defender robots and the goalkeeper robot. Each robot has been set its own defence area and specifications. They conducted three experiments namely simulator testing, real time testing, and ping pong testing to evaluate their proposed defence strategy. The experimental results show that the authors' proposed strategy versus three state of the art strategies can defeat up to 92% of all types of attack modes. Meanwhile, in the ping pong testing, their proposed strategy can still protect any goal entering from different attacking modes even though only one or two robots are active in the defence area.",,第4页.xls

461,Effectiveness of mHealth apps on adherence and symptoms to oral anticancer medications: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2024,"PurposeDespite the rapid expansion of mHealth apps, their adoption has not always been based on evidence of effectiveness on patient outcomes. This systematic review aimed to determine the effect of mHealth apps on adherence and symptom to oral anticancer medications (OAMs) and identify the app design that led to such effects.MethodsPubmed, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and WoS were searched from inception to April 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated effects of mHealth apps on primary outcomes OAM adherence and symptom burden were included. Two reviewers independently assessed risk-of-bias using Cochrane Risk-of-Bias version 2 and extracted the data. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023406024).ResultsFour RCTs involving 806 patients with cancer met the eligibility criteria. mHealth apps features included a combinations of symptom reporting, medication reminder, automated alert to care team, OAM and side effect information, one study implemented structured follow-up by a nurse. The intervention group showed no significant difference in OAM adherence (relative ratio 1.20; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.43), but significantly improved symptoms to OAMs with a lower standardised mean symptom burden score of 0.49 (SMD - 0.49; 95% CI - 0.93 to - 0.06), and a 25% lower risk of grade 3 or 4 toxicity (risk ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95) compared to usual care.ConclusionThese findings suggest a potential role for mHealth app in managing OAM side effect. Further research should explore the role of AI-guided algorithmic pathways on the interactive features of mHealth apps.",,第4页.xls
462,Adherence to hormone therapy in women with breast cancer: a quantitative study.,2016,"INTRODUCTION: The majority of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer are treated with oral endocrine therapies, which are administered in periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. Adherence, ie the degree a subject's behavior corresponds to the agreed recommendations, then becomes a significant problem, which can also affect distress levels. The aim of this study is to evaluate the level of adherence to endocrine therapy and distress in a sample of Italian women.METHOD: The study is a descriptive cross sectional survey. Adherence was measured with the Morisky Medication Adherence 8-item Scale and distress was measured by the Distress Thermometer. Socio-demographic and clinical data were also collected and then processed.RESULTS: Adherence measured with MMAS-8 items scored 6.18 corresponding to an average level of adherence in the 151 patients examined. The only factors affecting adherence signi- ficantly were: level of education, marital status and, among the side effects of therapy, poor concentration and memory. The data analysis obtained from the Distress Thermometer showed a degree of discomfort equal to 4.71,For example, in younger patients' levels of distress are greater in relationships, whereas in married/defacto women and workers distress levels are greater in practical areas.CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study can be useful to identify patients at risk for non-adhe- rence and distress, and consequently to help, the oncology team. Despite this, the study of adherence and related-factors needs further investigation.INTRODUZIONE: La quasi totalita delle pazienti con carcinoma mammario positivo ai recettori ormonali, viene trattata con terapie endocrine orali, da assumere per periodi che variano dai 5 ai 10 anni. Laderenza, ossia il grado con il quale il comportamento di un soggetto corri- sponde a quanto concordato con il medico, diviene quindi un problema rilevante, sul quale puo incidere anche il Distress. Lobiettivo di questo studio e quello di valutare laderenza alla terapia endocrina ed il distress, in un campione di donne italiane.METODO: Nellindagine quantitativa descrittiva, per la raccolta dati e stato utilizzato il questionario per laderenza MMAS-8-item, una scheda di raccolta dati socio-demografici-clinici ed il DistressThermometer.

463,Sustainable Blockchain-Enabled Services: Smart Contracts,2017,"This paper introduces some of the interdependent components within the multifaceted solution our team is developing towards accelerating the functionality, complexity and versatility of blockchain-enabled services. The focus here is particularly on introducing and bringing together selected individual components of the solution to achieve a synergistic effect in expanding the functionality of blockchain-enforced smart contracts. The contributions of this paper include: (i) proposing a method for automated management of contracts with hierarchical conditionality structures through an hierarchy of intelligent agents and the use of hierarchical cryptographic key-pairs; (ii) proposing a method for efficient and secure matching and transfer of smart-contract underlyings (entities) among disparate smart contracts/subcontracts; (iii) proposing a method for producing an hierarchy of common secrets to facilitate hierarchical communication channels of increased security, and applying this method both in the context of method (i) and method (ii); and (iv) proposing the use of distributed hash tables DHT in building secure and optimized repositories in the context of method (i) and in the context method (ii), where the former involves a DHT repository of smart contracts and the latter involves a DHT repository of entities underlying smart contracts that are being exchanged among different smart contracts and subcontracts. The smart-contract focused methods introduced in this paper contribute to the overall goal towards a sustainable adaptive mechanism for processing evolving volumes, versatility, and complexity of blockchain transactions, traffic, and services.

464,Cloud-based and Big data-enabled Brokerage System for Smart Grids,2017,"Electric energy networks provide the energy necessary to carry out daily operations in education, health care, commerce, entertainment, defense, and government. Smart grids (SG) have been proposed as a mechanism to modernize and facilitate the operation of energy grids in the presence of multiple third-parties vying to sell electricity and related services. Recently, a new concept has emerged in relation with SG: transactive energy a framework to integrate and coordinate multiple independent suppliers of electric services in an economic marketplace that enables purchases in a way that obeys the physical constrains of the underlying energy grid. Our team is developing a transactive energy framework called Open Access Smart Grids (OASIS). OASIS features a distribution-level marketplace where the underlying electric resources and services are open to access and provisioned by third parties. In this paper, we present a cloud based and big data-enabled brokerage system for Smart grids, which is a critical component of OASIS. In this brokerage system, consumer energy requests, and energy bids issued by producers, are collected and matched to find a list of energy purchase orders to be dispatched to the winning producers. A central piece in the system is an energy broker software agent, which drives the bidding process.",,第4页.xls
465,Learning Influential Cognitive Links in Social Networks by a New Hybrid Model for Opinion Dynamics,2021,"A principled approach to modeling sociocognitive networks is fundamental to understanding the network interrelations which in turn can be used in many applications such as human behavior analysis or team performance assessment. More specifically, in the opinion domain, learning the cognitive links and making a proper model for causal relationships between individuals is necessary for both analysis and control purposes. There are several mathematical models for opinion dynamics. However, few of them have been tested to be consistent with real-world data. In this article, a new hybrid model for opinion dynamics is proposed and is put to test with subjective experiments. It is imperative that a realistic model considers two cognitive facts: 1) a person tends to stick to his/her previously shaped opinion and 2) the opinion of a person is affected by others (either reinforced in a positive way or undermined negatively). This article presents a novel mathematical formulation of the proposed opinion dynamics model and proves its stability too. The new model is also extended to support multiple dimensions. In the multidimensional approach, opinions about two or more subjects are considered separately. The rationale behind this is to describe the evolution of agents' opinions on several topics. To study how the model performs in reality, some real-world experiments are conducted and the influence matrix is learned in each case. In addition, a method is introduced to extract the parameters of the model from the experimental data. It is shown that the new model predictions, after it is trained, chase the real behaviors of participants very well and result in less error compared with the previous models.",,第4页.xls
466,Creating an interface between behavior-modeling software and a robotic simulation environment,2023,"The Aquaticus capture-the-flag (CTF) game1, 2 was created several years ago at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a testbed for human-robot teaming experiments utilizing maritime robots controlled by the MOOS-IvP autonomy stack3, 4 and humans in motorized kayaks. Monterey Phoenix (MP)5 is an open-source program for scope-complete behavior modeling created at the Naval Postgraduate School. Our objective in the work presented in this paper is to create an interface between MP logical (discrete-event) behavior models, which are text script files, and the MOOS-IvP autonomy stack used for investigating continuous-time maritime robot autonomy, including complex behaviors such as automatic collision avoidance. These physical robot behaviors are achieved by the MOOS-IvP application by generating an appropriate stream of Helm behaviors at a repetition rate of four commands a second (speed and azimuth values) by approximate solution of nonlinear differential equations. We developed a tool that extracts relevant data from the Monterey Phoenix model in JSON format and then generates an IvP Helm behavior tree, allowing for simulations of robot behavior in the MOOS-IvP environment. The results of this research can be expanded upon in the future to allow interfacing between Monterey Phoenix and other simulation environments as well as to be used in reinforcement learning environments to generate AI/ML-enabled agents to either play the CTF game in a virtual environment or to be downloaded into robots to play the CTF game live at the multi-domain operations (MDO) Human-Robot Teaming Sandbox (MDO-HuRT-S) at the United States Military Academy.",,第4页.xls

469,"A Distributed, Collaborative Intelligent Agent System Approach for Proactive Postmarketing Drug Safety Surveillance",2010,"Discovering unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance as early as possible is of great importance. The current approach to postmarketing surveillance primarily relies on spontaneous reporting. It is a passive surveillance system and limited by gross underreporting (< 10% reporting rate), latency, and inconsistent reporting. We propose a novel team-based intelligent agent software system approach for proactively monitoring and detecting potential ADRs of interest using electronic patient records. We designed such a system and named it ADR-Monitor. The intelligent agents, operating on computers located in different places, are capable of continuously and autonomously collaborating with each other and assisting the human users (e. g., the food and drug administration (FDA), drug safety professionals, and physicians). The agents should enhance current systems and accelerate early ADR identification. To evaluate the performance of the ADRMonitor with respect to the current spontaneous reporting approach, we conducted simulation experiments on identification of ADR signal pairs (i.e., potential links between drugs and apparent adverse reactions) under various conditions. The experiments involved over 275 000 simulated patients created on the basis of more than 1000 real patients treated by the drug cisapride that was on the market for seven years until its withdrawal by the FDA in 2000 due to serious ADRs. Healthcare professionals utilizing the spontaneous reporting approach and the ADRMonitor were separately simulated by decision-making models derived from a general cognitive decision model called fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we recently developed. The quantitative simulation results show that 1) the number of true ADR signal pairs detected by the ADRMonitor is 6.6 times higher than that by the spontaneous reporting strategy; 2) the ADR detection rate of the ADRMonitor agents with even moderate decision-making skills is five times higher than that of spontaneous reporting; and 3) as the number of patient cases increases, ADRs could be detected significantly earlier by the ADRMonitor.",,第4页.xls
470,Relevant factors for the optimal duration of extended endocrine therapy in early breast cancer,2018,"For postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, the optimal subgroup and duration of extended endocrine therapy is not clear yet. The aim of this study using the IDEAL patient cohort was to identify a subgroup for which longer (5 years) extended therapy is beneficial over shorter (2.5 years) extended endocrine therapy.In the IDEAL trial, 1824 patients who completed 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (either 5 years of tamoxifen (12%), 5 years of an AI (29%), or a sequential strategy of both (59%)) were randomized between either 2.5 or 5 years of extended letrozole. For each prior therapy subgroup, the value of longer therapy was assessed for both node-negative and node-positive patients using Kaplan Meier and Cox regression survival analyses.In node-positive patients, there was a significant benefit of 5 years (over 2.5 years) of extended therapy (disease-free survival (DFS) HR 0.67, p = 0.03, 95% CI 0.47-0.96). This effect was only observed in patients who were treated initially with a sequential scheme (DFS HR 0.60, p = 0.03, 95% CI 0.38-0.95). In all other subgroups, there was no significant benefit of longer extended therapy. Similar results were found in patients who were randomized for their initial adjuvant therapy in the TEAM trial (DFS HR 0.37, p = 0.07, 95% CI 0.13-1.06), although this additional analysis was underpowered for definite conclusions.This study suggests that node-positive patients could benefit from longer extended endocrine therapy, although this effect appears isolated to patients treated with sequential endocrine therapy during the first 5 years and needs validation and long-term follow-up.",,第4页.xls
471,Research on the Fluctuation Characteristics of Social Media Message Sentiment with Time Before and During the COVID-19 Epidemic,2021,"Tree hole refers to a social media formed after the death of a social media user, in which other users continue to leave messages due to emotional resonance. This paper focuses on exploring the fluctuation of emotions with time in a tree hole of social media such as Microblog, and provides ideas and support for suicide warning, rescue, and user portraits of patients with depression in the tree hole. In this paper, the dataset of 2,356,066 messages captured from the tree hole Microblog with the tree hole agent (i.e., an AI program) and preprocessed. Subsequently, the effective dataset was labeled by a text sentiment analysis model based on BERT and BiLSTM, and accordingly the sentiment was scored. Then the scored data was visualized and analyzed in the time dimension. Finally, it was found that the sentiment of the tree hole messages reached a trough at 4:00 am and a peak around 8:00 am. In addition, the overall trend of tree hole sentiment has fluctuated downwards from Monday to Sunday. We have concluded that the sentiment of patients with depression fluctuates regularly at some special time points, and special events such as the outbreak of COVID-19 and so on, have a great impact on the emotions of patients with depression. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen warning and intervention for those who has expressed thoughts of suicide at special points to prevent the spread and fermentation of suicidal emotions in the tree hole in time. In addition, the rescue volunteers for patients with depression as Tree Hole Rescue Team should make corresponding adjustments to the rescue strategy when special events occur.

During the first year of treatment, HRQOL and symptoms of depression were analyzed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and its Endocrine Symptom Subscale (ES), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. In addition, predefined AEs were analyzed. A total of 166 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant tamoxifen, exemestane, or anastrozole. FACT-B scores increased after treatment began and remained significantly higher in the tamoxifen group than in the exemestane group or anastrozole group during the first year (P = 0.045). FACT-B scores were similar in the exemestane group and anastrozole group. ES scores and CES-D scores were similar in all treatment groups. Arthralgia and fatigue were less frequent, but vaginal discharge was more frequent in the tamoxifen group than in the exemestane group or anastrozole group. HRQOL was better in Japanese postmenopausal women treated with tamoxifen than those treated with exemestane or anastrozole. HRQOL and AEs were similar with exemestane and anastrozole. Given the results of the TEAM trial, upfront use of tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor (AI) may be an important option for adjuvant endocrine therapy in Japanese postmenopausal women.",,第4页.xls

This paper presents a numerical data-based machine learning (ML) framework for structural fire response prediction by integrating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Methods (FEM). Multiple ML models are developed to predict the real-time vertical displacement of the structure based on corresponding temperature field data with a numerical case of an 8 m x 8 m x 0.6 m virtual steel roof structure under 1200 virtual fire scenarios. The models are comparatively evaluated in terms of predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and model robustness. The results show the effectiveness of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models in real-time displacement prediction, indicating the feasibility of the framework in providing timely and reliable predictions of structural safety conditions for firefighters.

This paper uses a game-theoretical formulation for a multi-satellite system in which the satellites are viewed as a unique unit with their self-interests. To solve the problem, the first is to identify the utility functions for individual satellite, align them to form the global utility function which can represents the allocation requirements. The second is to design the suitable negotiation mechanisms that can be equipped on each satellite so they can pursue the optimization by their own interest. The Utility-based Regret play, the Smoke Signal play, and the Broadcast-based play are proposed as negotiation mechanisms for the team to cooperate under the distributed and decentralized system structure. The simulation results illustrate that using these mechanisms can help this multi-satellite system reaches a near-optimal allocation profile. The effectiveness of proposed mechanisms are demonstrated by comparing their simulation results with several existing mechanisms under different scale of participant number.

477,Wireless avionics and human interfaces for inflatable spacecraft,2008,"Revolutionary capabilities for robust control of inflatable Lunar and Martian transit vehicles and planetary habitats can be developed using advanced wireless network technology and modular avionics coupled with facile human to system interfaces. Fully wireless modular avionics would eliminate any cabling associated with power and data transmission, allowing easy deployment of flexible control systems and human interfaces. Furthermore, wearable human interface systems hosting virtual reality interaction methods can provide significant improvement in human situational awareness and control of dynamic space systems. The crew can interact with intelligent software agents providing human-like interaction using speech. These advanced information management systems would incorporate intelligent software agents to assist the crew in performing vehicle and mission operations. Advances in robust wireless data communications and wireless power transmission are the key technologies that enable this new spacecraft architecture. This paper will cover the proposed architecture for wireless spacecraft avionics including innovative human interaction techniques with spacecraft systems. The team believes these two aspects are intimately related and that mobile virtual human interfaces can solve many problems associated with operating spacecraft based on inflatable structures. Conventional architectures allocate much space to a cockpit from which the spacecraft is piloted and monitored. For the transit to Mars, which in most scenarios takes approximately 6 months, the cockpit becomes a major consumer of available space while being used only briefly during the journey for earth departure and planetary approach. Wireless control of the spacecraft would allow the piloting and monitoring function to be carried out from any location within the crew space. Identifying key technology developments required to support this architecture will involve evaluating current and next generation wireless networks, computational modules and wireless power transmission for avionics. Complementary methods for virtual human interfaces will be evaluated, with the rapid development of this technology enabling significant advances to be realized in the next decade. have to be provided by remote presence technology, which ties the virtual reality visual system with cameras on the outside of the craft. Spoken commanding and interaction with ship systems is also an important part of this concept. As ship systems become more complex, it will become impossible for the crew to remember exact details of all aspects of the operating environment. In this case the ability to ask questions about spacecraft status and have the agents issue audible spoken advisories and warnings becomes an important part of safely operating a very complex system. The shipboard agent systems can become in effect a much larger crew for the mission. With the round trip communication times approaching 40 minutes for the Mars transit, all of the mission operations knowledge will have to be built into the spacecraft, lessening dependence upon earth-based support. The operational authority has to be given to the astronauts augmented by virtual mission support provided by the knowledge agents on the spacecraft. A distributed wireless avionics system would provide the computational capacity for sophisticated support systems that inform the correct crew member of a problem needing their attention, and to assist them in performing a complex task.",,第4页.xls
478,Hypotensive Events in Pediatric Patients Receiving Dexmedetomidine for MRI,2024,"Purpose: Dexmedetomidine, the preferred pediatric sedating agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has the side effect of hypotension. Newer recommendations for reporting adverse events in pediatric procedural sedation include using a two-pronged definition. Our aim was to describe the incidence of hypotension in patients undergoing sedated MRI and to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with hypotension, applying a two-pronged definition, where a numerical threshold/clinical criterion must be met as well as at least one clinical intervention performed. Design: An observational cohort study. Methods: Medical record data were extracted for outpatients less than 18 years of age sedated primarily with dexmedetomidine for MRI in a single center for over a seven-year period. Patients who received propofol as an adjunct were also included. Hypotension was defined using a two-pronged approach, as a 20% reduction in systolic blood pressure from baseline lasting >= 10 minutes, coupled with a fluid bolus. Analysis included descriptive statistics, t tests and logistic regression using discrete-time survival analysis. Findings: Of the 1,590 patient encounters, 90 (5.7%) experienced hypotension. Males were significantly more likely to have hypotension. Patients with hypotension had overall longer appointment times, including longer sedation times and recovery time. Greater blood pressure (BP) variability in the preceding 20 minutes also increased the risk of hypotension. Conclusions: Our lower incidence of hypotension is likely related to the two-pronged intervention-based definition used, as it likely more accurately reflects clinically meaningful hypotension. To our knowledge, this is the first study using this approach with this population. Research further examining the relationship between prolonged sedation, blood pressure variability, gender, hypotension, and recovery time is needed. Understanding these relationships will help interdisciplinary teams, including nurses in pediatric procedural areas, to reduce the incidence of hypotension, potentially maximize patient safety, and optimize throughput.

479,A hybrid hemodynamic knowledge-powered and feature reconstruction-guided scheme for breast cancer segmentation based on DCE-MRI,2022,"Automatically and accurately annotating tumor in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), which provides a noninvasive in vivo method to evaluate tumor vasculature architectures based on contrast accumulation and washout, is a crucial step in computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, it remains challenging due to the varying sizes, shapes, appearances and densities of tumors caused by the high heterogeneity of breast cancer, and the high dimensionality and ill-posed artifacts of DCE-MRI. In this paper, we propose a hybrid hemodynamic knowledge-powered and feature reconstruction-guided scheme that integrates pharmacokinetics prior and feature refinement to generate sufficiently adequate features in DCE-MRI for breast cancer segmentation. The pharmacokinetics prior expressed by time intensity curve (TIC) is incorporated into the scheme through objective function called dynamic contrast-enhanced prior (DCP) loss. It contains contrast agent kinetic heterogeneity prior knowledge, which is important to optimize our model parameters. Besides, we design a spatial fusion module (SFM) embedded in the scheme to exploit intra-slices spatial structural correlations, and deploy a spatial-kinetic fusion module (SKFM) to effectively leverage the complementary information extracted from spatial-kinetic space. Furthermore, considering that low spatial resolution often leads to poor image quality in DCE-MRI, we integrate a reconstruction autoencoder into the scheme to refine feature maps in an unsupervised manner. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the proposed method and show that our approach can outperform recent state-of-the-art segmentation methods on breast cancer DCE-MRI dataset. Moreover, to explore the generalization for other segmentation tasks on dynamic imaging, we also extend the proposed method to brain segmentation in DSC-MRI sequence. Our source code will be released on https://github.com/AI-medical-diagnosis-team-of-JNU/DCEDuDoFNet.",,第4页.xls
480,Highly Flexible Swarm Intelligence Algorithm for Resilient Autonomous Systems,2018,"This paper provides an update to our ongoing Resilient Autonomous Systems (RAS) project that is being conducted at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and is supported by the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL). The objective of the RAS project is to develop a distributed multi-layer autonomous UAS planning and control technology for gathering intelligence in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) environments populated by intelligent adaptive adversaries. These resilient autonomous systems are able to navigate through hostile environments while collecting intelligence and minimizing the loss of assets. Our approach incorporates artificial life concepts, with the high-level architecture divided into three biologically inspired meta-layers: cyber-physical, reactive, and deliberative. Each meta-layer is a combination of N layers, each representing simple behavior, and collectively having a dynamic level of influence over the behavior of the agent. Algorithms within each layer act on a combination of perceptions, memory, and intents. Perceptions represent a filtered view of reality, abstracted in the layer immediately below, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next highest layer. Intents represent a recommended action output from the layer above, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next lowest layer. Each cycle, perceptions and intents are cleared. Memory permeates each layer, and allows the layers to retain some knowledge from previous cycles. Fast-reactive control systems in low meta-layers ensure a stable environment supporting cognitive function on higher meta-layers. The key concepts of our approach are: A layered architecture of intelligence on a spectrum from reactive to deliberative; the use of artificial life algorithms providing robust, complex behavior from a set of simple rules; communication of information between agents via observation; the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to assist the team in selecting and adapting the best solutions for each layer. This distributed cooperative system of intelligent assets will provide adaptable, scalable performance to accomplish mission goals in challenging environments.",,第4页.xls

482,"Coordination challenges and issues in stability, security, transition and reconstruction (SSTR) and cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles",2007,"SSTR operations are becoming a priority for the Department of Defense (DoD) and are being given the same stature as the more traditional combat operations. The near-term goal of SSTR is to provide the local populace with security, restore essential services, and meet humanitarian needs, while in the longer term ensure a stable infrastructure. Large scale disasters are an example where SSTR operations can provide value. In such scenarios, local governments and non-governmental institutions are under great stress in order to respond in a timely manner to provide basic relief to the affected communities, and there may be outburst of aid from the local groups. All of this can lead to a less than desirable outcome if poorly coordinated! The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) is becoming increasingly important. These assets can enable the collection of needed information for the execution of a given set of tasks. In large scale operations, however, the ability for the UAVs to self-coordinate may be needed as it will be difficult for human operators to effectively control large teams of UAVs. This paper will begin by introducing some of the key aspects of multiagent coordination, with a focus on the operational challenges with regard to SSTR such as disaster management response as well as UAV coordination. We will then discuss the coordination challenges and gaps in order to motivate an adaptive, multiagent based approach to coordination as well as additional opportunities for research. We will conclude with a brief summary.",,第4页.xls
483,A Mobile Nursing Information System Based on Human-Computer Interaction Design for Improving Quality of Nursing,2012,"A conventional Nursing Information System (NIS), which supports the role of nurse in some areas, is typically deployed as an immobile system. However, the traditional information system can't response to patients' conditions in real-time, causing delays on the availability of this information. With the advances of information technology, mobile devices are increasingly being used to extend the human mind's limited capacity to recall and process large numbers of relevant variables and to support information management, general administration, and clinical practice. Unfortunately, there have been few studies about the combination of a well-designed small-screen interface with a personal digital assistant (PDA) in clinical nursing. Some researchers found that user interface design is an important factor in determining the usability and potential use of a mobile system. Therefore, this study proposed a systematic approach to the development of a mobile nursing information system (MNIS) based on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction (M-HCI) for use in clinical nursing. The system combines principles of small-screen interface design with user-specified requirements. In addition, the iconic functions were designed with metaphor concept that will help users learn the system more quickly with less working-memory. An experiment involving learnability testing, thinking aloud and a questionnaire investigation was conducted for evaluating the effect of MNIS on PDA. The results show that the proposed MNIS is good on learning and higher satisfaction on symbol investigation, terminology and system information.",,第4页.xls
484,Barcoding of Giardia duodenalis isolates and derived lines from an established cryobank by a mutation scanning-based approach,2011,"We barcoded 25 in vitro isolates (representing 92 samples) of Giardia duodenalis from humans and other animals, which have been assembled by the Upcroft team at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research over a period of almost three decades. We used mutation scanning-coupled sequencing of loci in the triosephosphate isomerase, glutamate dehydrogenase and beta-giardin genes, combined with phylogenetic analysis, to genetically characterise them. Specifically, the isolates (n = 14) of G. duodenalis from humans from Australia (AD113; BRIS/83/HEPU/106; BRIS/87/HEPU/713; BRIS/89/HEPU/1003; BRIS/92/HEPU/1541; BRIS/92/HEPU/1590; BRIS/92/HEPU/2443; BRIS/92/HEPU/1706), Malaysia (KL/92/IMR/1106) and Afghanistan (WB), a cat from Australia (BAC2), a sheep from Canada (OAS1) and a sulphur-crested cockatoo from Australia (BRIS/95/HEPU/2041) represented assemblage A (sub-assemblage AI-1, AI-2 or AII-2); isolates (n = 10) from humans from Australia (BRIS/91/HEPU/1279; BRIS/92/HEPU/2342; BRIS/92/HEPU/2348; BRIS/93/HEPU/1638; BRIS/93/HEPU/1653; BRIS/93/HEPU/1705; BRIS/93/HEPU/1718; BRIS/93/HEPU/1727), Papua New Guinea (BRIS/92/HEPU/1487) and Canada (H7) represented assemblage B (sub-assemblage BIV) and an isolate from cattle from Australia (BRIS/92/HEPU/1709) had a match to assemblage E. Isolate BRIS/90/HEPU/1229 from a human from Australia was shown to represent a mixed population of assemblages A and B. These barcoded isolates (including stocks and derived lines) now allow direct comparisons of experimental data among laboratories and represent a massive resource for transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic and functional genomic studies using advanced molecular technologies.

485,Image-Guided Precision Medicine in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pheochromocytomas and Paragangliomas,2023,"Simple Summary Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare neural-crest-derived tumors with variable prognosis. In an era of tailored treatment strategies, medical imaging plays a crucial role in the surgeries, image-guided procedures, chemotherapies, immunotherapies, and radionuclide therapies involved in the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. Medical imaging helps to confirm the diagnosis, guide surgical resection, assess metastatic staging, and select patients for specific therapies. In this step-by-step review, we perform a comprehensive analysis of recent imaging modalities developed for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas by covering their content and terminology as well as discussing the future implications of artificial intelligence.Abstract In this comprehensive review, we aimed to discuss the current state-of-the-art medical imaging for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) diagnosis and treatment. Despite major medical improvements, PPGLs, as with other neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), leave clinicians facing several challenges; their inherent particularities and their diagnosis and treatment pose several challenges for clinicians due to their inherent complexity, and they require management by multidisciplinary teams. The conventional concepts of medical imaging are currently undergoing a paradigm shift, thanks to developments in radiomic and metabolic imaging. However, despite active research, clinical relevance of these new parameters remains unclear, and further multicentric studies are needed in order to validate and increase widespread use and integration in clinical routine. Use of AI in PPGLs may detect changes in tumor phenotype that precede classical medical imaging biomarkers, such as shape, texture, and size. Since PPGLs are rare, slow-growing, and heterogeneous, multicentric collaboration will be necessary to have enough data in order to develop new PPGL biomarkers. In this nonsystematic review, our aim is to present an exhaustive pedagogical tool based on real-world cases, dedicated to physicians dealing with PPGLs, augmented by perspectives of artificial intelligence and big data.",,第4页.xls
486,Imaging-based characterization of tumoral heterogeneity for personalized cancer treatment,2024,"With personalized tumor therapy, understanding and addressing the heterogeneity of malignant tumors is becoming increasingly important. Heterogeneity can be found within one lesion (intralesional) and between several tumor lesions emerging from one primary tumor (interlesional). The heterogeneous tumor cells may show a different response to treatment due to their biology, which in turn influences the outcome of the affected patients and the choice of therapeutic agents. Therefore, both intra- and interlesional heterogeneity should be addressed at the diagnostic stage. While genetic and biological heterogeneity are important parameters in molecular tumor characterization and in histopathology, they are not yet addressed routinely in medical imaging. This article summarizes the recently established markers for tumor heterogeneity in imaging as well as heterogeneous/mixed response to therapy. Furthermore, a look at emerging markers is given. The ultimate goal of this overview is to provide comprehensive understanding of tumor heterogeneity and its implications for radiology and for communication with interdisciplinary teams in oncology.",,第4页.xls
487,"An assessment of a sleep aid and sleep promotion practices in hospitalized medical patients (Reprinted from J Am Pharm Assoc, vol 64, 102042, 2024)",2024,"Background: Half of patients admitted to medicine units report sleep disruption, which increases the risk of sleep deprivation. Non-pharmacological interventions are the first step to improving sleep. However, utilization of sleep aids continues to be prevalent. Limited data are available on sleep aid prescribing practices across transitions of care.Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the current practices for assessing sleep and prescribing pharmacologic agents to promote sleep in the adult medicine population.Methods: This study was designed as a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study of all patients discharged by the general medicine teams over a 3-month period (September 2019- November 2019). Prior to admission, inpatient and discharge prescriptions for sleep aids were recorded, and documentation of sleep assessments and non-pharmacological interventions were evaluated.Results: Of 754 patients included, 211 (28%) were prescribed a sleep aid while inpatient. During hospitalization, 124 (16%) patients had at least one documented sleep assessment, and only 22 (3%) were ordered the institutional non-pharmacological sleep promotion order set. The most prescribed sleep aid in inpatients was melatonin (50%), as well as prior to admission (35%) and at discharge (25%). Overall, the relative reduction in sleep aid prescriptions between admission and discharge was 67%.Conclusion: Inpatient sleep aid prescribing is common in medical patients. Despite this, sleep assessments and the standard of care of non-pharmacological interventions are rarely utilized. Future efforts should focus on implementation of strategies to make sleep assessments and non-pharmacological sleep promotion routine and consistent in the inpatient setting.

488,Spatial-Temporal Cellular Traffic Prediction for 5G and Beyond: A Graph Neural Networks-Based Approach,2023,"During the past decade, Industry 4.0 has greatly promoted the improvement of industrial productivity by introducing advanced communication and network technologies in the manufacturing process. With the continuous emergence of new communication technologies and networking facilities, especially the rapid evolution of cellular networks for 5G and beyond, the requirements for smarter, more reliable, and more efficient cellular network services have been raised from the Industry 5.0 blueprint. To meet these increasingly challenging requirements, proactive and effective allocation of cellular network resources becomes essential. As an integral part of the cellular network resource management system, cellular traffic prediction faces severe challenges with stringent requirements for accuracy and reliability. One of the most critical problems is how to improve the prediction performance by jointly exploring the spatial and temporal information within the cellular traffic data. A promising solution to this problem is provided by graph neural networks (GNNs), which can jointly leverage the cellular traffic in the temporal domain and the physical or logical topology of cellular networks in the spatial domain to make accurate predictions. In this article, we present the spatial-temporal analysis of a real-world cellular network traffic dataset and review the state-of-the-art research works in this field. Based on this, we further propose a time-series similarity-based graph attention network, TSGAN, for the spatial-temporal cellular traffic prediction. The simulation results show that our proposed TSGAN outperforms three classic prediction models based on GNNs or GRU on a real-world cellular network dataset in short-term, mid-term, and long-term prediction scenarios.",,第4页.xls
489,Recent advances in hierarchical reinforcement learning,2003,"Reinforcement learning is bedeviled by the curse of dimensionality: the number of parameters to be learned grows exponentially with the size of any compact encoding of a state. Recent attempts to combat the curse of dimensionality have turned to principled ways of exploiting temporal abstraction, where decisions are not required at each step, but rather invoke the execution of temporally-extended activities which follow their own policies until termination. This leads naturally to hierarchical control architectures and associated learning algorithms. We review several approaches to temporal abstraction and hierarchical organization that machine learning researchers have recently developed. Common to these approaches is a reliance on the theory of semi-Markov decision processes, which we emphasize in our review. We then discuss extensions of these ideas to concurrent activities, multiagent coordination, and hierarchical memory for addressing partial observability. Concluding remarks address open challenges facing the further development of reinforcement learning in a hierarchical setting.",,第4页.xls

We evaluated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in American Indians/Alaska Natives (Al/ANs) with diabetes in the Special Diabetes Program for Indians Healthy Heart (SDPI-HH) Demonstration Project.Methods. Multidisciplinary teams implemented an intensive case management intervention among 30 health care programs serving 138 tribes. The project recruited 3373 participants, with and without current CVD, between 2006 and 2009. We examined data collected at baseline and 1 year later to determine whether improvements occurred in CVD risk factors and in Framingham coronary heart disease (CHD) risk scores, aspirin use, and smoking status.Results. A1c levels decreased an average of 0.2% (P < .001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels decreased, with the largest significant reduction in LDL cholesterol (Delta = -5.29 mg/dL; P < .001). Average Framingham CHD risk scores also decreased significantly. Aspirin therapy increased significantly, and smoking decreased. Participants with more case management visits had significantly greater reductions in LDL cholesterol and A1c values.Conclusions. SDPI-HH successfully translated an intensive case management intervention. Creative retention strategies and an improved understanding of organizational challenges are needed for future Indian health translational efforts.",,第4页.xls
492,A multiagent system-based solution for shipment operations with priorities in a container terminal,2011,"This paper proposes the use of a multiagent system-based solution for a proposed robotic-based automation system for the shipment operations of containers with shipment priorities in the port terminal located in Rio Grande City, Brazil. We faced with a problem of optimal policy formulation for teams of resource-limited robotic loaders in stochastic environments, which is composed of two strongly-coupled sub problems: a resource allocation problem and a policy optimization problem. The containers are required to be shared between the loaders, considering the following constraints: the containers have different weights and shipment priorities, the loaders have a maximum load that they can support during a journey, and, due to several reasons (e.g: administrative rules, maintenance schedule), the loaders are made available to the shipping operation only sequentially. We show how to combine the two problems, by formulating a policy optimization problem over the loading/unloading operations for each loader, as it becomes available. To solve the problem of container allocation to the next available loader we use a reduction of the Knapsack Problem. Then, we use Markov Decision Processes to decide on the shipment operations preformed by that loader in the terminal yard. These two processes are connected, since the container allocation process determines the states of the Markov chain that each loader actually visits. We simulated the resulting shipment operations using Net Logo.",,第4页.xls

We present some general ideas about prototypes deduced from analyses of our experiences with prototype designs in domain specific medical CBR systems. Four medical Case-based Reasoning systems are described. As they use prototypes for different purposes, the gained improvement is different as well. Furthermore, we claim that the generation of prototypes is an adequate technique to team the intrinsic case knowledge, especially if the domain theory is weak.",,第4页.xls
494,"Games, Actions and Social Software. Multidisciplinary Aspects: LNCS 7010",2012,"The book has three parts: I, II, and III. The first part deals with Social Software and the Social Sciences. In Chap. 1, explain the general meaning of the concept of social software, with an emphasis on the aspects of logical structure, knowledge and incentives. Chapter 2, draws a number of useful philosophical distinctions in the area of formal analysis of social mechanisms, focusing on the concepts of freedom, liberties and rights.In the final chapter in this part, Chap. 3, investigate the intriguing phenomenon of time discounting: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially if you hold the bird in the hand now, and the promise of two in the bush is for tomorrow. The second part of the book revolves around Knowledge, Belief and Action. In the first chapter in this part, Chap. 4, develop a formal logic of lying inspired by dynamic epistemic logic, concentrating on the effects of lies as communicative acts, and not modeling, say, the intentions of the liar. They apply their logical framework to lies in public discourse and finish by analyzing lying (or bluffing) in games like Liars Dice, making use of a custom-made extension of the automated epistemic model checker DEMO. In Chap. 5, discusses belief revision in the context of dynamic doxastic logic, which contains for each Boolean formula phi a propositional operator [*phi] standing for after the agent has come to believe that phi and revised his beliefs accordingly it is the case that. Segerberg provides a sketch of the resulting rich logical landscape. The final chapter in Part II, Chap. 6, is a logical analysis of the concept of a strategy in various kinds of games,. Van Benthem develops a plea for treating strategies as first-class citizens in explicit strategy logics, instead of hiding them under existential quantifiers saying that players have a strategy. This chapter is an updated and revised version of a paper that has circulated in manuscript form for about five years and has already sparked a number of ongoing research projects. The third and final part of the book discusses Perception, Communication and Cooperation. In Chap. 7, discusses perception in update logic, and presents a logic of change and perception. The next chapter of the book, Chap. 8, is a plea for a more realistic treatment of the notion of similarity, to take account of vagueness and lack of precision in perception. The authors present a framework that remains close to standard multimodal approaches, and show how it can be applied in multi-agent environments. Next, in Chap. 9, discusses the role of cognition and communication in cooperation. Step by step, the chapter moves through the stages of evolution studied by evolutionary biologists, and shows that different forms of cooperation can arise at different stages of evolution where they are enabled by higher and higher levels of cognition and more and more possibilities of communication. The description culminates with the pinnacle of cooperation, fully fledged teamwork. Thus, the book gently segues into the closing chapter. In the final chapter, present a logic of teamwork capturing the strong types of teamwork that can occur in human teams or among software agents, based on collective intentions and collective commitments, and open to the needs of re-planning teamwork in dynamic environments.",,第4页.xls
495,Facilitators and barriers to physical activity among English adolescents in secondary schools: a mixed method study,2023,"Background: It is evident that physical activity (PA) programmes implemented in schools were not effective in improving PA behaviours among adolescents. This study investigated students' perceptions of barriers to PA among inactive English adolescents in secondary schools based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model, the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The study compared barriers faced by inactive and active groups participating in sports and PA in secondary schools to identify sources of behaviour contributing to inactivity. Methods: A pre-intervention online survey was distributed to affiliated schools by 233 Teaching Schools Alliances ( TSAs) as part of the monitoring and evaluation of the Secondary Teacher Training study. Data were cross-tabulated to analyse activity levels and behavioural barriers for active and inactive groups, using the COM-B domains. The research team followed a seven-step process to categorise barriers based on their relevant domain in the TDF mapped to the COM-B. Results: The findings were derived from one of the most extensive surveys of adolescents ever undertaken involving 200,623 active and 8,231 inactive respondents. The study identified 52 barriers and 68 behaviours that prevent adolescents from participating in PA. Psychological and social barriers were found to affect all activity levels, genders, and ethnic groups, with a lack of confidence and self-consciousness being the most prevalent. Certain demographic groups, such as those from minority ethnic groups and disabled individuals, were found to be overrepresented among inactive populations. The finding of the study indicated that there were common barriers that affected both inactive and active groups, with further similarity when examining barriers between active and inactive girls. The study also found that girls were more likely to experience the main barriers compared to boys, while inactive boys were more likely to encounter these barriers compared to active boys. The findings suggest that common barriers could be addressed across the population, while recognising some differences in demographics, and the need to provide personalised support. Targeted interventions are also suggested for all girls and inactive boys. Conclusion: This study highlights the range of barriers that impact adolescents and provides insight into potential mechanisms for behaviour change, including intervention functions, policy categories, and evidence-based behaviour change tools. The study highlights the need for further research to address the barriers to PA among adolescents, particularly those who are inactive. Utilising the findings of this study, future research should investigate the effectiveness of novel digitalexercise interventions and policies in increasing PA levels among children and adolescents. Complex digital exercise interventions, including conversational AI solutions, could provide personalised tools to identify and revolutionise support around the multitude of barriers that impact adolescents globally.

496,Engineering collective intelligence at the edge with aggregate processes,2021,"Edge computing promotes the execution of complex computational processes without the cloud, i.e., on top of the heterogeneous, articulated, and possibly mobile systems composed of IoT and edge devices. Such a pervasive smart fabric augments our environment with computing and networking capabilities. This leads to a complex and dynamic ecosystem of devices that should not only exhibit individual intelligence but also collective intelligence-the ability to take group decisions or process knowledge among autonomous units of a distributed environment. Self-adaptation and self-organisation mechanisms are also typically required to ensure continuous and inherent toleration of changes of various kinds, to distribution of devices, energy available, computational load, as well as faults. To achieve this behaviour in a massively distributed setting like edge computing demands, we seek for identifying proper abstractions, and engineering tools therefore, to smoothly capture collective behaviour, adaptivity, and dynamic injection and execution of concurrent distributed activities. Accordingly, we elaborate on a notion of aggregate processas a concurrent collective computation whose execution and interactions are sustained by a dynamic team of devices, whose spatial region can opportunistically vary over time. We ground this notion by extending the aggregate computing model and toolchain with new constructs to instantiate aggregate processes and regulate key aspects of their lifecycle. By virtue of an open-source implementation in the ScaFi framework, we show basic programming examples as well as case studies of edge computing, evaluated by simulation in realistic settings.",,第4页.xls
497,The NUDGE trial pragmatic trial to enhance cardiovascular medication adherence: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,2021,"Background: Nearly half of patients do not take their cardiovascular medications as prescribed, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Mobile and digital technologies for health promotion and disease self-management offer an opportunity to adapt behavioral nudges using ubiquitous mobile phone technology to facilitate medication adherence. The Nudge pragmatic clinical trial uses population-level pharmacy data to deliver nudges via mobile phone text messaging and an artificial intelligent interactive chat bot with the goal of improving medication adherence and patient outcomes in three integrated healthcare delivery systems.Methods: The Theory of mHealth, the Expanded RE-AIM/PRISM, and the PRECIS-2 frameworks were used for program planning, implementation, and evaluation, along with a focus on dissemination and cost considerations. During the planning phase, the Nudge study team developed and piloted a technology-based nudge message and chat bot of optimized interactive content libraries for a range of diverse patients. Inclusion criteria are very broad and include patients in one of three diverse health systems who take medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. A target of approximately 10,000 participants will be randomized to one of 4 study arms: usual care (no intervention), generic nudge (text reminder), optimized nudge, and optimized nudge plus interactive AI chat bot. The PRECIS-2 tool indicated that the study protocol is very pragmatic, although there is variability across PRECIS-2 dimensions.Discussion: The primary effectiveness outcome is medication adherence defined by the proportion of days covered (PDC) using pharmacy refill data. Implementation outcomes are assessed using the RE-AIM framework, with a particular focus on reach, consistency of implementation, adaptations, cost, and maintenance/sustainability. The project has limitations including limited power to detect some subgroup effects, medication complications (bleeding), and longer-term outcomes (myocardial infarction). Strengths of the study include the diverse healthcare systems, a feasible and generalizable intervention, transparent reporting using established pragmatic research and implementation science frameworks, strong stakeholder engagement, and planning for dissemination and sustainment.",,第4页.xls
498,Modeling station duty officer operations assistant at Johnson Space Center,2003,"The mission operations directorate (MOD) at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) is responsible for the planning and operation of human space flight missions. MOD is being challenged with sustaining and developing new operations capabilities to support increasingly demanding requirements and to improve its processes to accomplish these missions at higher levels of safety, mission success, and effectiveness. Automation is being considered as an enabling technology to meet the aforementioned challenges. The synergistic combination of flight controllers and intelligent software providing the function of 'operations assistants' (OA) is being pursued as the key implementation of this technology in the Mission Control Center (MCC).The flight control team (FCT) assesses the condition and operability of the major systems such as electrical power, thermal control, life support, communications, altitude control, and data handling at MCC. OA assist the flight controllers with their tasks of monitoring the status and health of the flight systems. They also help maintain the flight controller's awareness of the operations being performed during the mission and help assure that operational objectives are being met. The station duty officer (SDO) performs the lead operations role for the International Space Station (ISS) during quiescent times when FCT and the flight director are off-duty. SDOs assess the condition and operability of the major ISS systems. This assessment involves monitoring and controlling several periodic processes on systems such as the electrical power, thermal control, life support, communications, altitude control, and data handling systems. The SDO is also responsible for coordinating operations with the Russian FCT. The OA will help the SDO maintain an awareness of all the processes performed on board and will assist with the responses to anomalous conditions. The OA for this position will support the concept of reduced control center staffing during quiescent times. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to present a unique two-stage specification methodology that combines data flow diagrams and petri nets and (2) to apply the proposed methodology in a complex space station system.

499,Hospital-acquired infections surveillance: The machine-learning algorithm mirrors National Healthcare Safety Network definitions,2024,"Background: Surveillance of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) is the foundation of infection control. Machine learning (ML) has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for HAI surveillance. We compared manual surveillance with a supervised, semiautomated, ML method, and we explored the types of infection and features of importance depicted by the model.Methods: From July 2021 to December 2021, a semiautomated surveillance method based on the ML random forest algorithm, was implemented in a Brazilian hospital. Inpatient records were independently manually searched by the local team, and a panel of independent experts reviewed the ML semiautomated results for confirmation of HAI.Results: Among 6,296 patients, manual surveillance classified 183 HAI cases (2.9%), and a semiautomated method found 299 HAI cases (4.7%). The semiautomated method added 77 respiratory infections, which comprised 93.9% of the additional HAIs. The ML model considered 447 features for HAI classification. Among them, 148 features (33.1%) were related to infection signs and symptoms; 101 (22.6%) were related to patient severity status, 51 features (11.4%) were related to bacterial laboratory results; 40 features (8.9%) were related to invasive procedures; 34 (7.6%) were related to antibiotic use; and 31 features (6.9%) were related to patient comorbidities. Among these 447 features, 229 (51.2%) were similar to those proposed by NHSN as criteria for HAI classification.Conclusion: The ML algorithm, which included most NHSN criteria and >200 features, augmented the human capacity for HAI classification. Well-documented algorithm performances may facilitate the incorporation of AI tools in clinical or epidemiological practice and overcome the drawbacks of traditional HAI surveillance.",,第4页.xls
500,Incremental learning with partial instance memory,2004,"Agents that team on-line with partial instance memory reserve some of the previously encountered examples for use in future training episodes. In earlier work, we selected extreme examples-those from the boundaries of induced concept descriptions-combined these with incoming instances, and used a batch learning algorithms to generate new concept descriptions. In this paper, we extend this work by combining our method for selecting extreme examples with two incremental learning algorithms, AQ11 and GEM. Using these new systems, AQ11-PM and GEM-PM, and using two real-world applications, those of computer intrusion detection and blasting cap detection in X-ray images, we conducted a lesion study to analyze the trade-offs between predictive accuracy, examples held in memory, learning time, and concept complexity. Empirical results showed that although the use of our partial-memory model did decrease predictive accuracy when compared to systems that learn from all available training data, it also decreased memory requirements, decreased learning time, and in some cases, decreased concept complexity. We also present results from an experiment using the STAGGER Concepts, a synthetic data set involving concept drift, suggesting that our methods perform comparably to the FLORA2 system in terms of predictive accuracy, but store fewer examples. Moreover, these outcomes are consistent with earlier results using our partial-memory model and batch learning. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,第4页.xls
501,Do type 1 receptor tyrosine kinases inform treatment choice? A prospectively planned analysis of the TEAM trial,2013,"Background: Epidermal growth factor receptors contribute to breast cancer relapse during endocrine therapy. Substitution of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may improve outcomes in HER-positive cancers.Methods: Tissue microarrays were constructed. Quantitative analysis of HER1, HER2, and HER3 was performed. Data were analysed relative to disease-free survival and treatment using outcomes at 2.75 and 6.5 years.Results: Among 4541 eligible samples, 4225 (93%) had complete HER1-3 data. Overall, 5% were HER1-positive, 13% HER2positive, and 21% HER3-positive; 32% (n = 1351) overexpressed at least one HER receptor. In the HER1-3-negative subgroup, the hazard ratio (HR) for upfront exemestane vs tamoxifen at 2.75 years was 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.87), in the HER1-3-positive subgroup, the HR was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.85-1.56). A prospectively planned treatment-by-marker analysis demonstrated a significant interaction between HER1-3 and treatment at 2.75 years (HR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.87; P 0.008), as confirmed by multivariate regression analysis adjusting for prognostic factors (HR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.85; P 0.005). This effect was time dependent.Conclusion: In the 2.75 years prior to switching patients initially treated with tamoxifen to exemestane, a significant treatmentby- marker effect exists between AI/tamoxifen treatment and HER1-3 expression, suggesting HER expression could be used to select appropriate endocrine treatment at diagnosis to prevent or delay early relapses.",,第4页.xls

503,A narrative review and update on drain-related outbreaks,2024,"Background: Outbreaks linked to hospital drainage systems are well reported, and continue to present challenges to incident management teams. Such outbreaks can be protracted and complex, with multi-modal strategies being required for remediation. Aim: To summarize recent drain-related outbreaks, investigate whether multi-modal control measures are being implemented, and determine any antecedent factors. Methods: Databases were searched for drain-related outbreaks over a 5-year period. Search terms employed included 'healthcare drainage outbreaks', 'drain outbreaks', 'drainage system outbreaks', 'sink outbreaks' and 'shower outbreaks'. Information was collected on country of origin, pathogens involved, unit affected, drain types, patient numbers, drainage system interventions, type of drain disinfectant, infection control interventions, typing method, outcomes and any antecedent factors. Findings: Nineteen drain-related outbreak studies were reviewed. The majority of incidents were due to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, and were from critical care settings. Most (16/19) studies recognized the need for a multi-modal approach. Information on the success of interventions was not documented for all incidents, but 13/ 19 studies reported no further cases after control measures. Variation in the choice of agent and frequency of application exists with regards to drain disinfection. Seven studies discussed antecedent factors. Conclusion: Despite drain-related outbreaks being reported for the last 24 years and review articles on the subject, outbreaks continue to pose significant challenges. There is currently no UK guidance on the management of drain-related outbreaks or the design of new buildings to mitigate the risk. Addressing the challenges from hospital drainage systems should be considered a priority by agencies and guidance developers.

504,Implausibly cooperative robots meet their selfish gene counterparts,2010,"The use and testing of computational models has become a core methodology for formalising, operationalising and testing theories across the natural sciences. Applied to language origins research, such methods can make explicit the assumptions needed to make a particular theory work, leading to conclusions potentially useful to evolutionary linguists, psychologists, archaeologists and anthropologists.A frequent objection to the computational models and experiments developed by Steels and his team (e.g. Steels 2009) is that they are biologically implausible. Steels' robotic agents spontaneously evolving lexicons and grammars as they repeatedly interact are not Darwinian organisms. Lacking selfish genes, they don't fight or deploy their signalling capacities for purposes of deception. Since their signals need not demonstrate honesty or reliability, the strategic costs of producing an effective signal in the animal world (Maynard Smith & Harper 2003) are absent by experimental design. Many of the problems likely to have been encountered by ancestral humans attempting to establish linguistic communication are consequently not represented.Steels' work is useful to the extent that it differentiates problems already solved from those which cry out to be addressed using other methods and assumptions. Symbolic communication by its very nature presupposes intentional honesty and communal coherence. Speakers might occasionally cheat once a linguistic code is in place, but a shared code cannot be established unless honesty is the default. It is not difficult to release robots into a community free of competition or conflict. Signallers may then communicate on the basis of infinite trust. In fact, levels of trust beyond anything biologically plausible have been shown to be optimal for linguistic self-organization across a community (Steels 2009). This is an interesting result, confronting Darwinians with a theoretical challenge. Can natural selection design minds to expect 'infinite trust'?What if Steels' robots could be designated male and female, each male seeking out fertile females and calculating whether to invest in his current partner's offspring or abandon her in favour of mating opportunities elsewhere? Female robots seeking to attract investment for their offspring would develop strategies aimed at maximizing the costs of philanderering. TheFemale Cosmetic Coalitions(FCC) model (Power 2009) sets out from assumptions in Darwinian behavioural ecology. Instead of invoking principles such as kin selection or reciprocal altrusim in the abstract, it accounts for distinctively human ultrasociality under specified conditions, distinguishing female fitness-enhancing strategies from male ones, differentiating between adjacent generations and connecting the logic at all stages to palaoanthropological and archaeological data. It posits costly communal ritual as the mechanism capable of enforcing cooperation across whole communities, and explains why such ritual should be focused on initiation, especially female initiation timed to coincide with first menstruation. It explains how the experience of initiation transposes language-ready minds from 'brute' reality into 'virtual' or 'institutional' reality - a world of patent fictions collectively taken on trust. It makes fine-grained predictions testable in the light of archaeological data - predictions recently vindicated by finds of Middle Stone Age ochre pigments at Blombos Cave and comparable South African sites. Until a rival hypothesis emerges, FCC seems the most promising way of connecting Steels' experiments and findings with the available archaeological and other empirical data.",,第4页.xls
505,Chatbot: Integration of Applications Within Slack Channel,2020,"Nowadays, huge amount of data are available which are used to get information. For extracting this information, according to user's requirements, there are many platforms available for searching incomprehensible or inconceivable data, for example, Quora, Google. But none of them provides optimized, accurate, precise, relevant answers. Even the problem of platform switching is observed. By developing our application and integrating it with Slack, this problem can be overcome and is beneficial for the Slack users. Slack software is cloud-based collaboration software and is designed to enable users to communicate easily and eliminate the app fatigue associated with using multiple communication applications. Slack software is a collaboration hub for work, no matter what work you do. It's a place where conversations happen, decisions are made, and information is always at your fingertips. It is a collaboration chat tool used both in and out of organizations to help teams communicate and coordinate in a more effective manner. Vizerto is a software application designed to get high-quality answers to our questions. In this, integration of these two platforms is done using APIs. The Slack conversation API provides your app with a unified interface to work with all the channel-like things encountered in Slack, public channels, private channels, direct messages, group direct messages, and our newest channel type, shared channels. Similarly, Vizerto API provides your app with a unified interface to get the search results in no time.

507,Toward Reliable Autonomous Robotic Assistants Through Formal Verification: A Case Study,2016,"It is essential for robots working in close proximity to people to be both safe and trustworthy. We present a case study on formal verification for a high-level planner/scheduler for the Care-O-bot, an autonomous personal robotic assistant. We describe how a model of the Care-O-bot and its environment was developed using Brahms, a multiagent workflow language. Formal verification was then carried out by automatically translating this model to the input language of an existing model checker. Four sample properties based on system requirements were verified. We then refined the environment model three times to increase its accuracy and the persuasiveness of the formal verification results. The first refinement uses a user activity log based on real-life experiments, but is deterministic. The second refinement uses the activities from the user activity log nondeterministically. The third refinement uses conjoined activities based on an observation that many user activities can overlap. The four samples properties were verified for each refinement of the environment model. Finally, we discuss the approach of environment model refinement with respect to this case study.",,第4页.xls

509,C-3PR: A Bot for Fixing Static Analysis Violations via Pull Requests,2020,"Static analysis tools are frequently used to detect common programming mistakes or bad practices. Yet, the existing literature reports that these tools are still underused in the industry, which is partly due to (1) the frequent high number of false positives generated, (2) the lack of automated repairing solutions, and (3) the possible mismatches between tools and workflows of development teams. In this study we explored the question: How could a bot-based approach allow seamless integration of static analysis tools into developers' workflows? To this end we introduce C-3 PR, an event-based bot infrastructure that automatically proposes fixes to static analysis violations through pull requests (PRs). We have been using C-3PR in an industrial setting for a period of eight months. To evaluate C-3PR usefulness, we monitored its operation in response to 2179 commits to the code base of the tracked projects. The bot autonomously executed 201346 analyses, yielding 610 pull requests. Among them, 346(57%) were merged into the projects' code bases. We observed that, on average, these PRs are evaluated faster than general-purpose PRs (2.58 and 5.78 business days, respectively). Accepted transformations take even shorter time (1.56 days). Among the reasons for rejection, bugs in C-3PR and in the tools it uses are the most common ones. PRs that require the resolution of a merge conflict are almost always rejected as well. We also conducted a focus group to assess how C-3PR affected the development workflow. We observed that developers perceived C-3PR as efficient, reliable, and useful. For instance, the participants mentioned that, given the chance, they would keep using C-3PR. Our findings bring new evidence that a bot-based infrastructure could mitigate some challenges that hinder the wide adoption of static analysis tools.",,第4页.xls
510,Assistive Robot with an AI-Based Application for the Reinforcement of Activities of Daily Living: Technical Validation with Users Affected by Neurodevelopmental Disorders,2022,"In this work, we propose the first study of a technical validation of an assistive robotic platform, which has been designed to assist people with neurodevelopmental disorders. The platform is called LOLA2 and it is equipped with an artificial intelligence-based application to reinforce the learning of daily life activities in people with neurodevelopmental problems. LOLA2 has been integrated with an ROS-based navigation system and a user interface for healthcare professionals and their patients to interact with it. Technically, we have been able to embed all these modules into an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier board, as well as an artificial intelligence agent for online action detection (OAD). This OAD approach provides a detailed report on the degree of performance of a set of daily life activities that are being learned or reinforced by users. All the human-robot interaction process to work with users with neurodevelopmental disorders has been designed by a multidisciplinary team. Among its main features are the ability to control the robot with a joystick, a graphical user interface application that shows video tutorials with the activities to reinforce or learn, and the ability to monitor the progress of the users as they complete tasks. The main objective of the assistive robotic platform LOLA2 is to provide a system that allows therapists to track how well the users understand and perform daily tasks. This paper focuses on the technical validation of the proposed platform and its application. To do so, we have carried out a set of tests with four users with neurodevelopmental problems and special physical conditions under the supervision of the corresponding therapeutic personnel. We present detailed results of all interventions with end users, analyzing the usability, effectiveness, and limitations of the proposed technology. During its initial technical validation with real users, LOLA2 was able to detect the actions of users with disabilities with high precision. It was able to distinguish four assigned daily actions with high accuracy, but some actions were more challenging due to the physical limitations of the users. Generally, the presence of the robot in the therapy sessions received excellent feedback from medical professionals as well as patients. Overall, this study demonstrates that our developed robot is capable of assisting and monitoring people with neurodevelopmental disorders in performing their daily living tasks.",,第4页.xls
511,Baseline characteristics of the diabetic participants in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT),2001,"Objective - Hypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the setting of diabetes. There is no consensus on how best to treat hypertension among those with diabetes. Here we describe the characteristics of a cohort of hypertensive adults with diabetes who are part of a large prospective blood pressure study. This study will help clarify the treatment of HTN in the setting of diabetes.Research design and methods - The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (AI.I.HAT) is a double-blind randomized trial of 42,448 high-risk hypertensive participants, ages greater than or equal to 55 years, designed to determine whether the incidence of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and combined cardiovascular events (fatal and nonfatal CHD, revascularization surgery, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, and stroke) differs between diuretic (chlorthahdone) treatment and three alternative antihypertensive therapies: a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin). The planned follow-up is an average of 6 years, to be completed in March 2002.Results - There are 15,297 diabetic individuals in the ALLHAT study (36.0% of the entire cohort). Of these individuals, 50.2% are male, 39.4% are African-American, and 17.7% are Hispanic. Demographic and laboratory characteristics of the cohort are similar to those of other studies of the U.S. elderly population with HTN. The sample size has 42 and 93% confidence respectively, for detecting a 16% difference between the diuretic and each of the nondiuretic treatments for the two study outcomes.Conclusions - The diabetic cohort in ALLHAT will be able to provide valuable information about the treatment of hypertension in older diabetic patients at risk for incident CVD.",,第4页.xls
512,End-to-End Approach for Autonomous Driving: A Supervised Learning Method Using Computer Vision Algorithms for Dataset Creation,2023,"This paper presents a solution for an autonomously driven vehicle (a robotic car) based on artificial intelligence using a supervised learning method. A scaled-down robotic car containing only one camera as a sensor was developed to participate in the RoboCup Portuguese Open Autonomous Driving League competition. This study is based solely on the development of this robotic car, and the results presented are only from this competition. Teams usually solve the competition problem by relying on computer vision algorithms, and no research could be found on neural network model-based assistance for vehicle control. This technique is commonly used in general autonomous driving, and the amount of research is increasing. To train a neural network, a large number of labelled images is necessary; however, these are difficult to obtain. In order to address this problem, a graphical simulator was used with an environment containing the track and the robot/car to extract images for the dataset. A classical computer vision algorithm developed by the authors processes the image data to extract relevant information about the environment and uses it to determine the optimal direction for the vehicle to follow on the track, which is then associated with the respective image-grab. Several trainings were carried out with the created dataset to reach the final neural network model; tests were performed within a simulator, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach was additionally demonstrated through experimental results in two real robotics cars, which performed better than expected. This system proved to be very successful in steering the robotic car on a road-like track, and the agent's performance increased with the use of supervised learning methods. With computer vision algorithms, the system performed an average of 23 complete laps around the track before going off-track, whereas with assistance from the neural network model the system never went off the track.",,第4页.xls

517,"Prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of the colonization or infection of multidrug-resistant organisms in adults: a systematic review, critical appraisal, and meta-analysis",2024,"Background: Prediction models help to target patients at risk of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization or infection and could serve as tools informing clinical practices to prevent MDRO transmission and inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy. However, there is limited evidence to identify which among the available models are of low risk of bias and suitable for clinical application. Objectives: To identify, describe, appraise, and summarise the performance of all prognostic and diagnostic models developed or validated for predicting MDRO colonization or infection. Data sources: Six electronic literature databases and clinical registration databases were searched until April 2022. Study eligibility criteria: Development and validation studies of any multivariable prognostic and diagnostic models to predict MDRO colonization or infection in adults. Participants: Adults (>= 18 years old) without MDRO colonization or infection (in prognostic models) or with unknown or suspected MDRO colonization or infection (in diagnostic models). Assessment of risk of bias: The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Evidence certainty was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Methods of data synthesis: Meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the discrimination and calibration of the models' external validations conducted in at least two non-overlapping datasets. Results: We included 162 models (108 studies) developed for diagnosing (n = 135) and predicting (n = 27) MDRO colonization or infection. Models exhibited a high-risk of bias, especially in statistical analysis. Highfrequency predictors were age, recent invasive procedures, antibiotic usage, and prior hospitalization. Less than 25% of the models underwent external validations, with only seven by independent teams. Metaanalyses for one diagnostic and two prognostic models only produced very low to low certainty of evidence. Conclusions: The review comprehensively described the models for identifying patients at risk of MDRO colonization or infection. We cannot recommend which models are ready for application because of the high-risk of bias, limited validations, and low certainty of evidence from meta-analyses, indicating a clear need to improve the conducting and reporting of model development and external validation studies to facilitate clinical application.

518,Owner reported clinical signs and treatment decisions in equine pastern dermatitis,2022,"Equine pastern dermatitis has a high prevalence in the equine population, especially in draft breeds. This skin condition is difficult to treat, and it is suspected that owners often decide on a treatment without consulting a veterinarian. The objectives of this study were to describe owner-reported clinical signs, severity, and reasons to consult a veterinarian. Moreover, we inquired about preventive measures and treatments, both instituted by owners without previous consultation or prescribed by their veterinarians.A total of 123 horses (owners recruited over social media) were included in the study. All horses suffered from equine pastern dermatitis at least once in the two years preceding the study. Standardized questionnaires collecting information on management, housing conditions, clinical signs as well as preventive measures and treatments were filled out by participants. The data was recorded, and descriptive statistics were performed.Most horses (71 out of 115 available answers, 62 %) had shown clinical signs of equine pastern dermatitis at least four times in their lives. A total of 113 horses (92% of all included horses) were affected by equine pastern dermatitis at the time of the interview. For 37 horses (32%) out of 114 available answers the owners consulted their veterinarian only after the horse showed signs of pain or lameness. Usually, treatments that did not require a medical prescription were applied without consulting their veterinarian (e. g. only 9 % (14 out of 150 prescriptions) of topical creams promoting wound healing were prescribed by a veterinarian). A total of 31 treatment decisions (55%) with creams containing anti-bacterial, anti-mycotic and/or anti-inflammatory agents and 100 0 /o of systemic medications containing anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic or anti-inflammatory agents were prescribed by veterinarians. Overall, 69% of treatment decisions were made without consulting a veterinarian, making it then more difficult to determine underlying causes for the pastern dermatitis and rendering the treatment often longer and more onerous. To raise owner awareness of possible consequences if a veterinarian is consulted too late in the disease process, specific information campaigns to improve animal welfare should be considered.",,第4页.xls
519,Comparison of once and twice daily dosing of didanosine in combination with stavudine for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. AI 454-146 Team.,1999,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the antiviral activity, safety and tolerability of didanosine dosed once and twice daily when administered in combination with stavudine dosed twice daily in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals with little or no previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs.DESIGN: Comparative, multicentre, randomized, open-label, short-term study.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-four HIV-1-infected adults with qualifying baseline CD4 cell counts of 200 to 500 cells/mm3 were included in the study. Of these, 43 patients received once daily didanosine plus twice daily stavudine (group A) and 41 subjects received twice daily didanosine plus twice daily stavudine (group B). The primary efficacy analysis used was the time-averaged difference (TAD) between treatment regimens of variations in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels from baseline over the first 12 weeks of therapy. Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 cell counts and adverse events were monitored.RESULTS: At week 12, median HIV-1 RNA variations were -1.18 log10 copies/ml in group A and -0.88 log10 copies/ml in group B. For patients who were followed up to week 24, median variations of HIV-1 RNA levels from baseline were -1.21 log10 copies/ml in group A and -0.78 log10 copies/ml in group B. The TAD between the two treatment groups for variations from baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels over the first 12 weeks was 0.10 log10 copies/ml (95% confidence interval, -0.19 to 0.40), indicating equivalence.CONCLUSION: Once daily didanosine plus twice daily stavudine and twice daily didanosine plus twice daily stavudine are equally effective in reducing plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and increasing CD4 cell counts. Both regimens are safe and well tolerated.",,第4页.xls

521,On applying integrative design-oriented cognitive science to hypertext: a framework for cognitive productivity,2022,"In The Reflective Practitioner [10], Donald Schon argued that applying science is not a simple matter of drawing logical implications from theory. Practice is messy. How might cognitive science inform the development of hypertext applications? Empirically oriented researchers might proceed in a 'lean' fashion, treating designs as hypotheses to be induced from and tested by data. Instead, in my talk I will show ways in which an integrative design-oriented (IDO) approach to understanding humans as autonomous agents [3] might help design hypertext apps. The approach suggests important problems to address and original ways to think about them. Conversely, designing and testing software can inform our IDO theories. I will illustrate the IDO approach with a theory of, and application for, sleep onset and insomnolence. Then I will focus mainly on hypertext applications that are more directly aimed at improving 'cognitive productivity', meaning how efficiently and effectively one uses knowledge resources to solve problems, deliver services, create products and ultimately improve oneself.Cognitive science is meant to be the interdisciplinary computational study of brain-based and artificial information processing. In practice, cognitive scientists almost exclusively focus on classical or 'dry' cognition (memory, perception, reasoning, language, etc.) Emotion, motivation and ancillary functions tend at most to be viewed as distinct processes that can interact with cognition. In contrast, the IDO approach is necessarily integrative, seriously attempting to understand diverse blended mental functions, including motivational, affective and ancillary processes. It is partly inspired by artificial general intelligence [8]. While authentically interdisciplinary, the IDO approach is necessarily design-oriented meaning it revolves around attempts to reverse-engineer functionality (the 'designer stance'). It values specification and understanding of competence over prediction. It posits and is intrinsically concerned with requirements of autonomous interdependent agency (humans and other automata), such as the necessity of pursuing multiple top-level motivators in contexts of danger and despite limited knowledge. Two examples of research in this tradition are [1, 12].A particularly impressive and inspirational early application of the designer stance, underpinning the IDO approach, is Lamontagne's theory of visual motion perception, which though not integrative led to the discovery of an entirely new class of visual illusions [6]. A promising example of integrative empirical psychology, though not from the designer stance, is Agnes Moors' theory of emotion [9]. Imagine how much more can be achieved by combining integrative and design-oriented approaches as described above.Being so ambitious, the IDO approach calls for doing research and development in teams, which ideally include software architects. A major reason for doing computer simulations in AI is to determine whether one's theory can account for what we think it can, as Lamontagne's simulations did, (rather than it being 'hand waving'). Deriving hypertext or other practical applications from IDO theories will be much more difficult than from non-integrative theories. Like [8] say of the relationship between cognitive science and AGI, applications from IDO might normally (for the foreseeable future) at best be inspired by IDO theories. Still, I believe the back and forth between developing IDO models of autonomous agents and applying them will benefit both science and technology.My colleagues and I have used the IDO approach in characterizing aspects of 'emotion', repetitive thought, obsession, addiction and mental alarms as mental perturbance [3]. Mental perturbance, by specification, involves the asynchronous generation and activation of motivators, which tend to consume executive functions (attention, deliberation, meta-management), influencing motives, goals and behavior [3, 11, 12]. Mental perturbance is thus inherently an IDO concept.The IDO approach is being used as a basis for developing the somnolent information-processing (SIP) theory of sleep-onset and insomnolence [2]. SIP is an attempt to reverse-engineer the human sleep-onset control system as involving multiple blended mind-brain functions [7]. One of the postulates of SIP is that mental perturbance is insomnolent (interferes with onset of sleep). The SIP theory in turn informally led to a prediction that certain mental patterns could be both pro-somnolent and counter-insomnolent. If so, then sleep onset could be facilitated by triggering such patterns via the 'cognitive shuffle': imagining diverse concrete objects, scenes and actions prompted by audio hypertext (with SomnoTest and mySleepButtonreg apps). While SIP is early stage research and development, it may serve as a reference model for future IDO applications.Drawing on my two Cognitive Productivity books, I will sketch a cognitive productivity framework with seven principles and several key IDO concepts (such as effectance, architecture-based motivation and meta-effectiveness). I will illustrate how IDO-thinking can help specify hypertext software for these principles and concepts. For example, (a) assessing knowledge resources requires distinguishing caliber, utility, potency and appeal (CUP'A). (b) In The Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking1 24 knowledge workers argued that ubiquitously available hyperlinks (in all user interfaces and automation of user-facing software) would contribute to intermediate awareness[4, 5] (consciousness), psychological flow (aspects of strategic surfing) and cognitive productivity. The manifesto has since been signed by many others. (c) Productive practice is a form of deliberate practice based on research on test-enhanced learning, expertise, testing effects, and other areas. Its objectives are ambitious; they are not merely to enable factual learning, but also the development of manifold 'mindware' underlying habits, attitudes, etc. Each of these concepts (CUP'A, consciousness, flow, mindware, etc.) should be understood in IDO terms and pose research challenges.The Cognitive Productivity framework also applies to transforming ourselves with fiction. I will suggest that subscription streaming services like Netflix, Inc., and e-book services could be augmented with fun but implicitly serious games hyperlinked to content with a view to helping consumers apply, in their day to day lives, knowledge gleaned from fiction.The practical end of the Cognitive Productivity framework is to help humanity, with hypertext software, address its opportunity and obligation to use knowledge to become more profoundly effective.See https://cogzest.com/projects/meta-effectiveness/human22-keynote-ido/ for additional information.",,第4页.xls
522,Treatment persistence and adherence in people with type 2 diabetes switching to iGlarLixi vs free-dose combinations of basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist,2022,"BACKGROUND: Fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin (BI) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have greater simplicity of administration with expected improved adherence/persistence with therapy, but real-world data are lacking.OBJECTIVE: To compare medication persistence, adherence, and health care resource utilization (HRU) and costs for insulin glargine 100 U/mL and the GLP-1 RA tixisenatide (iGlarLixi) with newly initiated free-dose combinations of BI and GLP-1 RAs initiated simultaneously or sequentially.METHODS: This analysis used the US Optum Clinformatics (January 2017 to November 2019) database and included data from adults (aged >= 18 years) with type 2 diabetes and a glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) of 8% or more. Participants received iGlarLixi or free-dose combinations of Bland GLP-1 RAs prescribed simultaneously or subsequently. Participants were followed for 12 months. Cohorts were propensity score matched on baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was persistence (days on treatment without discontinuation). Secondary outcomes were adherence (proportion of days covered), change in A1c, and all-cause and diabetes-related health care resource utilization and costs. Subgroup analyses were performed for individuals with A1c levels of 9% or more.RESULTS: After propensity score matching, there were 1,357 patients in each group; groups were well balanced. In the free-dose combination group, 65.6% started on BI, then added GLP-1 RAs; 28.5% started on GLP-1 RAs, then added BI; and 5.9% started on GLP-1 RAs and BI on the same day. In the subgroup with a baseline of A1c levels of 9% or more, 952 (iGlarLixi) and 932 (free-dose combination) participants were included. A significantly higher proportion of participants in the overall population who received iGlarLixi vs free-dose combinations were persistent (44.8% vs 36.3% [hazard ratio = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.11-1.35, P < 0.001]; the median [Q1, Q3] number of persistent days was 150 [63, 360] vs 120 [60, 310]) and adherent to therapy (41.3% vs 18.7%, [odds ratio = 3.06, 95% CI = 2.57-3.65: P < 0.001]). Results for persistence in the subpopulation of participants with HbA1c levels of 9% or more were similar. Reductions in A1c from baseline were similar between iGlarLixi and the free-dose combination group (overall population: -1.2% vs -1.3%; P = 0.1913), but the number of participants in the database with follow-up A1c data was low. All-cause and diabetes-related pharmacy visits and total medication and diabetes medication pharmacy claims costs were significantly lower (all P < 0.001) for those receiving iGlarLixi vs free-dose combinations in both populations.CONCLUSIONS: In adults with type 2 diabetes, iGlarLixi was associated with longer persistence by approximately 30 days, improved adherence, and reductions in outpatient and pharmacy visits and in pharmacy costs.",,第4页.xls
